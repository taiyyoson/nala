How did things go with your sleep routine goal of turning off screens at 11 and being in bed by 11:30, and your walking goal of 30 minutes twice a week on Fridays and Saturdays?"

It sounds like you made the most of that opportunity.\n\nSo just to make sure I'm understanding correctly, were you able to complete both goals - the sleep routine of screens off at 11 and in bed by 11:30 for three days, and the 30-minute walks on Friday and Saturday?"

That's your body telling you what it needs.\n\nNow I want to check in on something. On a scale of 1 to 10, what was your stress level like this past week?"

Before we do that though, I want to make sure I understand what happened with your current goals this week.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to adjust the sleep goal - does that mean you were able to do the screens off at 11 and in bed by 11:30 for three days, or did something come up that made you realize you need a different approach?"

      "content": "That's excellent that you completed your goal and now you're ready to challenge yourself a bit more. Adding one more day to make it 4 days a week sounds like a great progression.\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you about achieving this adjusted goal of screens off at 11 and in bed by 11:30 for four days a week?"

Let's talk about how you'll remember to work on these goals after our program ends.\n\nSince this is our final session together, what kind of system do you think will help you stay on track with your sleep goal - maybe a phone reminder, a journal to track your progress, or something else that fits your style?"
