We'll meet once a week for the next four weeks, so we'll have four sessions total. During our time together, we'll work on setting personalized health goals that matter to you, create strategies that fit your lifestyle, and track your progress along the way. Between our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and when we meet each week, we'll discuss how things went and adjust as needed.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"

You're already walking three times a week for 20 minutes, so you have a solid foundation to build on.\n\nWhen you say you want to up the amount you walk, what does that look like for you?

I want to make sure we set you up for success though.\n\nGoing from 20 minutes straight to 60 minutes all at once can be really tough on your body and might lead to soreness or burnout. What if we created a plan where you start increasing your walking time this week, but build up gradually so you can reach that hour sustainably? For example, maybe adding 10-15 minutes each week so you hit your hour goal by week four?"

That's a solid plan!\n\nNow let me make sure I understand what activity we're talking about specifically. When you say walking, where will you be doing this? Will it be outside in your neighborhood, at a gym on a treadmill, at a park, or somewhere else?"

So just to make sure I have this right, you'll be walking in the park three times a week, starting at 30 minutes this week and adding 10 minutes each week until you reach an hour.\n\nNow here's an important piece - when exactly do you want to achieve this goal? Are we talking about reaching that 60-minute walk by the end of our four-week program, or do you have a different timeframe in mind?"

A 9 out of 10 shows you really believe in yourself and this plan, which is such a strong foundation for success.\n\nSince you're feeling so confident about your walking goal, I'm curious about other areas of your wellness. Is there another health or wellness goal you'd like to work on during our program, maybe something related to nutrition, sleep, stress management, or another area that matters to you?"

Your walking goal is solid and meaningful, so let's put all your energy there.\n\nBetween now and when we meet next week, you'll be on your own to track your progress and stay accountable to yourself. What's your plan for remembering to do your three 30-minute walks this week?"

Your goal is to walk in the park three times a week, starting with 30 minutes and adding 10 minutes each week to reach 60 minutes by the end of the program. You're feeling really confident at a 9 out of 10, and you'll be using phone reminders to help you stay consistent. You'll track your progress on your own this week, and I'm excited to hear how it goes when we meet again next week for Session 2. You've got this, Jade!"
