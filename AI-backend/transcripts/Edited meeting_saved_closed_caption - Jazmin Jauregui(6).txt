17:15:00 Participant: I'm doing good how are you? Good, I just woke up. I had a headache.

17:15:15 Coach: How's your headache doing now?

17:15:15 Participant: It was it's, it's better now. Um, I went to work. And I thought I was just going to be there for like a few hours, and I ended up staying there till three. So I only had like a smoothie like earlier and I was like I want to get home. And I was like yeah I gotta eat. So that's why I had a headache. So, but it went away after I ate.

17:15:36 Coach: Okay, Well I'm glad it went away and also like, Oh my goodness headaches are the worst.

17:15:44 Participant: Yeah. I don't know if I told you, but I had COVID like the beginning of the year. I'm sorry I was getting a phone call, um, I had COVID at the beginning of the year. So my headaches. Like, it's probably like a migraine or something but after COVID, they got even worse, like my, sense of smell and like I never like would get headaches and after COVID like I get them here and there. 

17:16:16 Coach: But yeah so COVID or not like headaches. So the only thing you had eaten all day was that smoothie though?

17:16:30 Participant: I had like a sandwich in the morning before I left so I was like at nine. And then I took my smoothie to drink it at work. So that was like, 11, and then I ate totally a snack at one, I think. So I went to eat and then I drove to to the house.

17:16:52 Coach: So next time pack some snacks.

17:16:54 Participant: Yes, I was like why didn't I pack anything but I was like, I thought I was just going to be there to fill out one paper and come home and I didn't know, especially with the work that you do. There's always something.

17:17:11 Coach: Um, but thank you for meeting with me today. I can't believe it's already our third health coaching session.

17:17:22 Participant: One more after this, so fast.

17:17:22 Coach: Yeah, it goes by so fast. Um, so I know considering you know your day and like you just waking up like just extra thanks for, for meeting with me. Um, so, as always, I just wanted to check in with you about the text messages. How have those been or what are your thoughts about those. This week?

17:17:50 Participant: It was really good. I feel like you just use, you send the right one and like at the right time I don't know I don't know which one it was, um, it wasn't. It was a one from Target or something, was a target or us to go shopping or something like that.

17:18:06 Coach: Oh, like do something for yourself.

17:18:09 Participant: Yes, and I was gonna go to Target to shop, and I was like, No, I can do... how do they know I needed this.

17:18:20 Coach: Yeah. So what did you end up doing instead of going to target?

17:18:20 Participant: And so, I didn't, I don't remember what day was that remember, I think it was Saturday, Saturday, what do I do well I had a class. And I had a class, and then after that, I just stay home and I wanted to get a massage on Saturday. Yeah, so that was like at seven so instead of going to target I went to get a massage and then I went to get and then went home.

17:18:54 Coach: I'm over there any other messages that like stood out to you or motivated you in some way?

17:19:02 Participant: The one for him today to go outside, I was already outside, but I was at work.

17:19:13 Coach: And then for today. I do want to ask about like your stress level. What's been your stress level this week?

17:19:26 Participant: I would say, like a five. I'm not stressing about anything. This week for this week. I'm not stressing about it.

17:19:36 Coach: Okay. And then, I'm going back to like your health goals of like that you set for the week which I think was around working out for 20 minutes. Yes, I'm on a scale of one to 10, how did you do in meeting your health goal?

17:19:50 Participant: I did it for on Friday.

17:19:54 Coach: Okay, so, on a scale of one to 10?

17:19:59 Participant: Um, I would say eight and did it that day.

17:20:03 Coach: But, awesome. How do you feel?

17:20:03 Participant: I feel good like it makes me stay awake.

17:20:17 Coach: So, that's kind of like the main questions I had for you. But what are you hoping to get out of today's session, and what health goals, would you want to set for this coming week?

17:20:33 Participant: And I don't know if this will count like, I, I take vitamins for my hair. But I'm so bad at taking them like I moved them to my desk, so that you could see them and I still don't take them. And I have gummies and I have two other pills that I would like to take, and I am not consistent on taking them so I would like that to be I don't know if that would count as my health goals. Take my vitamins for my hair.

17:21:06 Coach: Um, so yeah so you want to help like establish your vitamin routine? So, how often do you have to take these just once a day?

17:21:19 Participant: Mm hmm. There's a. I have like three brands that I have the gummies and then I have like an organic one and then there's two more that you have, like, one more. So I have to take three.

17:21:36 Coach: So, tell me about, like, when you've tried to do this before, what have been your challenges?

17:21:48 Participant: Um, so I had them near my vanity for my makeup. And I would see them there, but I was like maybe if I have them, and I would take them here and there and then I was like maybe if I move them to my desk. I'll take them. I'll be consistent. So I take them here and there but I'm still not consistent like I'll take them like today and then I'll, I'll see them and I'm like I don't want to take them today. So I'm like why am I like that like they're right there in the container and I won't take them.

17:22:25 Coach: So you like you see them every day on your desk. But it's just kind of deciding whether like you want to take them or not wanting to take them.

17:22:36 Participant: Yeah. You know I think I'm just being lazy to be honest, like, it's just that laziness.

17:22:55 Coach: What, What would it take you to overcome this?

17:23:06 Participant: You know I think this, I have the gummies and I'll take them like right away. They just chew on them. And I'll say like having a water bottle, all the time. With me here, because the pill ones are big. So by the time I get up and get water. And I think it's like the. My issue is not having a water bottle nearby. That would make it like, boom, boom.

17:23:33 Coach: Yeah, and we talked about how drinking water is like one of, like, the more challenging things for you. So, yeah, maybe, do you normally do, like bottled water or do you have like cups of water, what's your. What's your primary?

17:23:53 Participant: Okay, so like you have like bottled water, and then you just like pick it up and go.

17:23:53 Coach: Yeah. Okay, So what if we set you up with like two water bottles next to your vitamins for the whole week? And so those water bottles would just be for your vitamins. Do you think something like that would be helpful?

17:24:18 Participant: Yeah. Yes.

17:24:18 Coach: Okay. Cool. So we've kind of problem-solved there and we're going to give it a try to see if that was the missing piece.

17:24:26 Coach: Um. The other thing that may be helpful is like taking them at the same time every day. What, what would be a good time to take them like in the morning and the afternoon before your workout like with your protein shake?

17:24:46 Participant: I usually take them when I'm sitting down like on my desk. So like around 10. Once I'm done like with with work, I don't sit back down so yeah like 10, 10am.

17:25:14 Coach: So, would it be helpful to do some kind of reminder on your phone, or alarm or I can send you like a Google calendar invite, and then that will notify you? So sorry I kind of gave you two options the Google calendar invite or like the alarm on your phone or the reminder that you have on your phone. Are you wanting to do both or one or the other?

17:25:44 Participant: I can do the alarm on my phone.

17:25:53 Coach: Do you want to set that up now? Cool. So we have the alarm on your phone, and then I'll try to text you just to check in every once in a while, to see how it's going. So, I'm just to repeat it back to you. In the next week you will take your hair vitamins every day once a day at 10am. I have two bottles of water. And then you also have the alarm on your phone. And then, on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your goal?

17:27:23 Participant: I would say a seven.

17:27:28 Coach: Is there anything that we can do to like, like increase your confidence?

17:27:37 Participant: Maybe that Google calendar thing.

17:27:40 Coach: Okay, the Google Calendar. Okay and then did you take your vitamins today?

17:27:53 Participant: No, but they're on my desk.

17:27:57 Coach: Okay, so, oh that's another, that's another good point, are there gonna be other days where you like maybe don't sit at your desk?

17:28:11 Participant: And usually I don't sit on my desk on Wednesdays, and I have meetings, but the other days, I do so maybe I will move them to my vanity, which is where I'm at. In the morning to get ready.

17:28:29 Coach: So I'll just say like move to vanity. That might be helpful. And then the other place because the other thing that you do routinely is like, um, well I'm making assumptions here but hopefully, good dental hygiene, like you brush your teeth every day. And in the morning. And so, I had another participant who put theirs posted on their bathroom mirror, and then that would like help them, remind them to like do their health goal. Okay, so I'm going to add something. Yeah, but I'll just put that in there in case you want it.

17:29:11 Participant: Yeah, I don't think I forget is like I said I see them and I know they're there. And I'm just, it's just a lazy thing like. The water is not there I'm not taking them.

17:29:25 Coach: Yeah, like go get water and then Yeah, yeah. Every day so seven vitamins obtainable you have the resources. You do have waters just like putting it right next to it. And then, to make it relevant like why is it important for you to take your hair vitamins every day?

17:29:59 Participant: I want my hair to grow I feel like it, it has stayed at that length. And I don't know if you feel that way about your hair like sometimes it's just stuck there. So I've been wanting to like my hair is long, but I want it longer so I know that if I'm consistent with taking the vitamins, it's going to help the hair grow faster.

17:30:30 Coach: Sorry, I didn't hear you, my internet says it's unstable.

17:30:39 Participant: You, you were freezing, I just said that. I just want my hair to grow, its  been at one length too long.

17:30:53 Coach: So you want your hair to grow, and specifically wanted longer. Okay, so, I think you have a really good goal here. um, any questions about the goal itself or if you want to create a new goal or a secondary goal anything like that? Do you plan on continuing the workout goal or?

17:31:41 Participant: Yes, I want to. I don't know if I told you, like I want to I want bigger legs.

17:31:52 Coach: So what we don't have to put it down as the health goal if you don't want to, but I am curious like what, like, what do next steps look like for you. So I know the gym is open.

17:32:04 Participant: Um, but I'm still like scared to go back. So I, one of my friends was out there and she was like, oh they, they're only letting like 30 people in at a time. So there's not, it's not like packed. So I been talking to my boyfriend to see if we, if, if we should go back and just work out there, and if not just continue working here.

17:32:33 Coach: How's it been working out at home, like what have your workouts been like this week?

17:32:39 Participant: Um, let me pull up my calendar. I have them on my calendar.

17:32:45 Coach: Yeah. And then I think you're I remember you saying you're going to use like the fitness app and then like Yeah.

17:32:52 Participant: Yes So legs, I did like, Monday, Tuesday I did abs. Wednesday I just did like jumping jacks and stuff like that so more like cardio. And then, Thursday I did legs again. And then Friday I didn't do anything.

17:33:16 Coach: Cool. That's awesome. It's so good. Like every day you focus on a part of your body, how was it was like the routine, like, your protein and then you're changing into your clothes and stuff?

17:33:31 Participant: So I went to for the meal shake I went to buy mangoes, because my mom has like a mixture of different fruits and I really didn't like that. So I bought mangoes so that made it made it better. And then change into my clothes like I'm home already, so as soon as usually like if I like if I don't have to leave my house, I just changed my shirt and leave some shorts. So I so it's not that difficult, so that it's been okay.

17:34:05 Coach: Um, I think. Yeah, I don't know, I don't necessarily have any other like specific questions but if there's anything else you want to check in about, you're welcome to share, or we can end, we can end like super early.

17:34:25 Participant: Hey, yeah I thank you for all your help, and your reminders.

17:34:29 Coach: Yeah. Okay, now we'll go over that Google calendar thing. Okay so 10am, vitamins?

17:34:41 Participant: Yes.

17:34:41 Coach: Alrighty. I'll get that sent out. And then, I think we are on the schedule to meet next Monday at the same time so 5:15?

17:34:52 Participant: Yes.

17:34:52 Coach: Okay, cool. Um, feel free to reach out if you have any other questions or need any support, like hey Jasmine I still am not taking my vitamins like let's problem solve. What do we gotta do?
