08:59:30 Coach: Hi.

08:59:33 Participant: How's it going today.

08:59:35 Coach: I'm doing well. How are you?

08:59:37 Participant: Good, I feel the week just flew by.

08:59:40 Coach: Yeah, it was going really fast, and it's very gloomy.

08:59:52 Participant: Yeah, I'm all bundled up this morning, it's cold here today. Hi.

08:59:52 Coach: Are you in the city?

08:59:56 Participant: No, I'm in San Jose, but it's a little cloudy and just feels cold, and I woke up congested.

09:00:09 Coach: Well, thank you so much for joining me today. We'll jump in and get started. How was your week, and how did you do with your goals?

09:00:24 Participant: My week was pretty good. Like we said, it went by super fast.

09:00:27 Coach: Yeah.

09:00:32 Participant: I just stayed busy—classes, catching up on homework, and also hanging out with friends. I did complete my goal. I went for two half-hour walks without music, just on my own. Those were really nice.

09:01:03 Coach: And for your second goal?

09:01:07 Participant: We had talked about picking a recipe. I ended up making a recipe I hadn’t tried before. I went grocery shopping on Sunday, found some new pasta noodles, and made pasta. It was new for me; I usually don’t make pasta. I shared it with a friend, and it was fun.

09:01:53 Coach: On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate your progress on your goals last week?

09:02:01 Participant: Good, I think a nine.

09:02:05 Coach: Great! You tried a new recipe and did some walking. Any challenges getting out for walks?

09:02:22 Participant: Just squeezing it in. One day I got off the bus a stop early and walked the rest of the way.

09:02:39 Coach: Finding time can be tough, but that’s a good strategy. How about stress levels last week?

09:03:25 Participant: Probably a three.

09:03:31 Coach: Are you excited that it’s almost done?

09:03:36 Participant: Yes, everything is winding down. Our last exam was done, and we don’t have finals in that class. Other classes are winding down too.

09:03:57 Coach: What are you hoping to check in about today? Goals or other things on your mind?

09:04:16 Participant: I like the goals; they help keep my stress down. Maybe another mindfulness goal.

09:04:33 Coach: Go ahead.

09:04:43 Participant: Trying to think… since I’ve been doing some mindfulness walking, I was wondering if I could do meditation on its own, without walking or journaling.

09:05:04 Coach: Yeah, that’s an idea. Do you have other thoughts?

09:05:18 Participant: Sometimes I get really caught up in what I’m doing and don’t make time for important people in my life. I feel like a bad friend and maybe want to schedule time to connect with others.

09:05:50 Coach: Are you thinking of calling a friend, or scheduling a block of time in your day for that?

09:06:10 Participant: Yes, even maybe sending an email. I’m a big list person, so I could block it in.

09:06:47 Coach: Scheduling it as a list item makes it more likely to happen. Are you thinking of connecting with one friend or more?

09:07:18 Participant: Just blocking out time to connect in the next week.

09:07:57 Coach: Let’s get specific with the meditation. You said 10–15 minutes?

09:08:24 Participant: Yeah, 10–15 minutes, or longer if it’s a guided one, once instead of shorter sessions multiple times. Afternoons are good.

09:08:56 Coach: Great. Let’s shoot for one session this week.

09:09:17 Coach: How confident are you about the walking and meditation?

09:09:33 Participant: About an eight.

09:09:39 Coach: And for connecting with a friend, how much time would you carve out

09:09:59 Participant: Probably an hour. Morning works best, flexible day. Confidence?

09:10:55 Participant: Seven.

Coach: That’s fine. The important part is the attempt; availability of the friend is secondary.

09:11:31 Participant: Sounds good.

09:11:41 Coach: You mentioned continuing your walking meditation, twice a week in the afternoon for 30 minutes?

09:12:14 Participant: Yes.

Coach: Great. How confident about continuing?

09:12:53 Participant: Probably nine.

09:13:03 Coach: Any challenges or successes last week?

09:13:19 Participant: Timing was key—finding extra time to walk or grocery shop. Motivation can be tough in cold or misty weather, but having a friend helps.

09:14:30 Coach: Having a buddy is motivating, yes.

09:14:59 Participant: I have a hiking plan on Saturday with a friend.

09:15:21 Coach: Good. How about messages this week—anything stand out or motivate you?

09:15:42 Participant: Yes, “take a break from computer/TV and get outside.” It reminded me to go for a walk.

09:16:23 Coach: That’s great. Any others?

09:16:32 Participant: I liked the one with the letter and flowers.

09:17:05 Coach: Any other items to check in?

09:17:15 Participant: Not today.

09:17:21 Coach: After four weeks, the text messages stop; the coaching continues. You’ll have a feedback interview too.

09:18:11 Participant: Got it.

09:18:38 Coach: You mentioned in-person sessions on campus; some logistical issues, but we’ll note it.

09:19:35 Participant: I just want the graduation ceremony to feel normal, walk across and get my diploma.

09:20:12 Coach: Staff and department mostly vaccinated. You could petition for an in-person event in the fall if needed.

09:21:03 Participant: Sounds good.

09:21:10 Coach: You have three goals this week; I’ll send a summary and some guided meditation recordings for home use.

09:21:47 Participant: Thank you.
