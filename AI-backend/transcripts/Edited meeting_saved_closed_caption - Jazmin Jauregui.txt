11:04:20 Coach: Hey, how are you?

11:04:22 Participant: I'm doing good how are you. 

11:06:09 Coach: And it's been quite a while since we last met, how are you doing everything, and your health goals?

11:06:25 Participant: I'm good overall yeah it's been like 10 days. Um, it has been good I'm sorry I do not disturb settings are like not where they're supposed to be notifications. Okay. Um, but yeah, overall, they're pretty good. I'm like, in bed, today, but overall I wasn't for the last week, except for Monday, because Monday was just exhausting. Um, but yeah like every other day for that went well. And then the nighttime routine one has been a little bit more lax, just because sometimes I don't feel like I need the whole routine like last night I was asleep by like 11:15. Almost unintentionally. Um, but yeah. Overall I think it's going well I feel like I'm more well rested also recently just started working with a nutritionist and so I feel like I've been getting like more vitamins and nutrients throughout the day, which makes me feel like less tired. A little bit more energized. So, Yeah, overall going well.

11:07:44 Coach: Wow, that's awesome. Sounds like you're really trying to work towards a lot of things right now.

11:07:49 Participant: Yeah, definitely.

11:07:54 Coach: Cool. Um, so, on a scale of one to 10, like how do you think you did in meeting your health goals?

11:08:04 Participant: Um. That one was like, I forget how many days we said but it was like good Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and like I made it out of bed this morning but I showered I got back in bed. Um, so I feel like that one was maybe. I feel pretty good about that one. And then the other one maybe like a five, 50 percent.

11:08:43 Coach: Okay. So for the first one, an 8?

11:08:46 Participant: Yeah.

11:08:50 Coach: Cool. So I think, well, first of all, congratulations on meeting your health goal, do you think that is something you want to keep as part of like your everyday life, or like How was it for you. How did you feel. Working at your desk rather than in your bed, do you think that helped your sleep, etc etc.

11:09:16 Participant: Yeah. Um, I don't know if it helps my sleep I know it helps me be like a more productive employee, and I feel more like energized throughout the day because I don't feel tempted to like, roll over and take a nap. Yeah, and it helps me kind of compartmentalize my life a little bit more so like, that's work and over here is like resting and hanging out over there's eating you know like they don't all need to be in the same place. Um, so yeah I think it's something that I will try to keep doing just because I know how much better I feel when I do it. But it's nice to kind of know that I can still fall back on it kind of as an option. Um, so yeah like Monday I overslept and I was exhausted and so like being able to stay in bed and not feel guilty about it. I'm like right now like getting out of the shower and not having to like put on real clothes and sit at my desk was nice like, I'm sure. Well, actually. Yeah, today I've got a doctor's appointment in a couple hours and stuff so like, it'll break up my day a little bit more and I know I'll end up at my desk at one point, but it's nice to kind of have, the more low key like working from home, you can stay in bed if you want to option, but not to be relying on it.

11:10:50 Coach: I think a couple of things that you said really stuck out of like working at your desk helps you feel more energized throughout the day, which like who doesn't want that, and also like you feel more productive and to me, I'm not sure if it is the same for you but, like, when I feel productive I feel better overall. So really leaning into those aspects of our life where we feel better, I'm so on the same line, um, how about your stress, what's your stress been like this week?

11:11:30 Participant: Um. Overall it's been okay. Every time someone's like, how are you I'm like overall I'm fine it's just like a lot of little like inconveniences that kind of all stack up on top of each other. So like today I've got like three different appointments, I have to do like in the midst of my normal work. Last night I have class and I like don't really care for this class and so that's like stressful and bothersome for me. Because it. It's the health behavior and communications course, it just feels like it's so much of it is common sense I feel like that, when I'm there for four hours I'm like why am I doing this. But I'm. Yeah, I'm like dealing with like a medical bill that I have to pay that I shouldn't have been charged for and so like stuff like that. So I feel like overall like. It's okay, but it's there are a lot of little things that are kind of just piling up.

11:13:01 Coach: I know the little things may not feel big but because of how many they are can definitely feel overwhelming. Um, or like uncomfortable. So would you rate your stress level this week like five or six or maybe more?

11:13:11 Participant: Um, yeah maybe like a five. And I tend to be like a pretty low stress person. Oh, But that's not always good. It's like my brain doesn't feel stress. When like when it piles up and piles and piles up, and my body is stressed. So anyway, yeah I'd say it's like a five this week.

11:13:47 Coach: You received a few messages in addition. Last week, what are your thoughts about the messages?

11:13:56 Participant: Um, let's see, I think some of them are cute like I saw the exercise one was like a cute little cartoon. They were cool I feel like I liked the ones that like I could tell came from you, like that were more focused on like, specifically what we talked about, rather than the ones that were like a little bit more general. Um, but yeah I I thought they were cute.

11:14:43 Coach: Um, did any of them like motivate you, or like inspire you in some way. Not that, that was like their main intention, but just transitioning towards like your health goal for this week, like, what, what's coming up for you?

11:15:02 Participant: Yeah, I'm, I've been... the fruits and vegetables one stood out to me. And like the nutritionist and I have been talking about that as well so that's something that like I've been focusing on the last few days. I've been like yesterday I made like an egg frittata for breakfast and today I made like homemade BLT basically for breakfast with an egg and some veggies and stuff on it. Um, so I feel like that one stood out just because it's something like I was kind of already working on in terms of this next week I think that like increasing my step count and drinking more water are kind of the two that I was feeling more drawn to. Just because I feel like the nutrition piece is kind of being taken care of and I feel like I'm in a better place with like the sleep piece.

11:16:04 Coach: Cool. Um, so let me write this down so in the next week. Water. So I think that's really exciting. You're my first participant who has like a step oriented goal. So, I want to hear more about that. What is your goal specifically?

11:16:33 Participant: Yeah. Um, so let's see here. I average like between three and 4000 steps a day. But there are some days when it's like four or 5000 and there are other days when it's like 700. So I was just thinking of like trying to make it more consistent like I will get you know at least 4000 steps, at least five days a week or something like that. Just because like there are days when, especially on Wednesdays with class like last Wednesday for example I worked from 6:45am. Till like two and then I went and got my COVID vaccine and then I had a class. And so I got like 800 steps all day, and it was like, from my from here to my car from my car to Walgreens and from Walgreens back and like that was it. So, I'm just a little bit more consistent like I'll at least like, get out and walk down the block to get like at least a couple of thousand steps. On a more regular basis, rather than kind of that fluctuation.

11:17:51 Coach: Okay. So I think, um, Let me just say this so in the next week you will walk 4000 steps minimum on five of the seven days.

11:18:04 Participant: Yeah.

11:18:09 Coach: Um, so, one thing that like you were mentioning was the way that your lifestyle is right now is very, very sedentary, and that you want to be. You want to like create time for you to go out for a walk.

11:18:27 Participant: Yeah. Um, I do. So, yesterday like I went for a walk on my lunch break, because I knew I was going to have class in the evening. And so I knew that I was just going to like sit around for an extra four hours. Um, my neighborhood's really safe so I've gone for walks at like 10pm before if I'm feeling like kind of restless. Um, I've also since I've been falling asleep earlier, I've been waking up earlier and so I almost even have time like before work to do that as well. And I could like walk down to Starbucks and get coffee or something like I could make it more fun or motivating. if I'm like actually going and doing it.

11:19:22 Coach: Okay. I think that's really good like going into that problem solving more a little bit of like I do have the time it's just being creative about getting those steps in.

11:19:33 Coach: Cool. And then so the other thing is like. Do you remember what like the SMART goal stands for?

11:19:49 Participant: Yeah, I'm. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic and Timely or something like that.

11:19:52 Coach: Yeah, for the R I like to use more relevant, instead of realistic, just because I want to figure out like is this important to you, so like what is the why, but we'll get there. We'll get there in a second. On the measurable piece 4000 steps is really specific, and it. Do you have like an apple watch a Fitbit to like count help you count those steps?

11:20:22 Participant: It's just like the Health app on my phone, it's not super accurate. So just like as long as it's in my pocket or in my hand or something like, I don't know how accurate it is but it does count it gives me a number so.

11:20:31 Coach: Okay, so you're going to be using that app and that feels comfortable. Hmm. Okay. And then, So you mentioned five out of the seven days. What do you want to be more specific on which of those five days or keep it kind of broad?

11:20:54 Participant: Yeah, kind of broad I think, um, sometimes Wednesday's get too busy but other times Wednesdays are the day when I like really want to get out and get some energy going, mostly weekends are better but like I'm getting a big tattoo on Sunday so I know I'll be like sitting still for like seven hours. Like this weekend will work so like just the general five days rather than specific would work better for this one, I think.

11:21:22 Coach: Okay, cool. Um, by any chance, do you have any, like, or do you enjoy hiking or are there like nature trails near you. Does that help inspire you, or.

11:21:36 Participant: Yeah, I do enjoy it, it's not as nearby. I'm like it's much easier to just like put on my sneakers and like walk around in my neighborhood. When I can go hiking like I do enjoy it. And I have a friend specifically who I hike with. And like I said this weekend kind of already crazy but on a normal weekend like we could go and do that.

11:22:08 Coach: OK, cool. So yeah, maybe we won't, I won't include it here because it doesn't seem relevant. But yeah, something we can look at for another day. I'm so curious. So what are you gonna get tattooed?

11:22:32 Participant: Um, it's like, it's some ocean animals and it's like this big, and they're like swimming in a circle. And on my hip. It's actually based on a drawing from a children's book but this is the sketch.

11:22:43 Coach: I'm so pretty. Yeah, thank you.

11:22:56 Participant: Um, so yeah, I'm excited. I've been wanting it for a couple of years and I finally like, because of COVID and everything I found a color artist that like is excited about it and wants to do it so we're finally doing it this Sunday. So, I have one tiny tattoo. And I feel like I want more but I'm like, I can't commit, I have commitment issues so this is going to be like my biggest and most elaborate, but they're addictive.

11:23:33 Coach: I know I have a sense that this isn't going to be like the last one, there's definitely more to come.

11:23:41 Participant: Oh, I should do like a space themed one like on my other hip, I'm like already thinking about it and I'm not even that far yet.

11:23:51 Coach: Yeah, get through this one. Let me know how it goes. I don't wanna, I don't want you to feel uncomfortable but I totally be open to seeing pictures.

11:24:01 Participant: Oh, awesome. Yeah, I want to see if I can take a picture that's not totally raunchy with like family and friends and stuff. Um, but yeah I'm excited.

11:24:15 Coach: I'm sorry, going back to your health goal.

11:24:32 Participant: Um, I feel just like health overall I'm again more energy like I know that the mornings when I managed to get out and like go for a walk, even to like get coffee before work, like I'm energized throughout the day and I don't feel like I'm going to fall back into bed. And then in the evening and it almost has the opposite effect like if I'm feeling really like overstimulated like maybe I had too much coffee that day, or I just can't wind down like it's nice to just like go walk down the street and come back. I feel more relaxed. So yeah just feeling better, um, whether that's like energy or relaxation. It's kind of both.

11:25:25 Coach: Yeah, that's awesome. So, um, you know, just to reflect what you said like walking will help improve your health overall. In the morning, it helps you increase your energy and also prevent you from like getting back into bed which relates to your previous goal. And then at night, going on these walks will help you unwind and feel more relaxed. So much good stuff from one little activity.

11:26:01 Participant: All right, that's the thing like when I started eating a little bit healthier the other day and I was like immediately feeling better. I was like wow is this all it took like really one single vegetable my body's like, Oh wow. So many nutrients.

11:26:19 Coach: Yeah, yeah I like substituted the chickpea pasta for like regular pasta so it's got like higher protein and fiber and stuff and I was like oh my gosh like to feel energized after a meal instead of feeling like I just want to crawl into bed like wow. Well, good for you for making these changes. For the confidence scale question. What's your level of confidence in meeting your SMART goal?

11:27:00 Participant: I'm. Ah, maybe like a seven, I feel like I'm already averaging like 4000 steps a day it's just not as consistent as I want it to be. So the consistency piece, I love that like, okay, and I do five days a week, like some weeks are busier than others but I feel like it's still attainable and 4000 steps really isn't that much like that's like a 20 minute walk you know and so I could squeeze that in, even if I'm like, oh shoot like I'm falling behind like I could squeeze that in at the end of the day like without too much issue.

11:27:36 Coach: Yeah, like a low, low bar, I don't wanna say like low bar but like obtainable bar, like it's an obtainable bar. Yeah, Cool. Um, so, with with how it was last week I'll check in on you and you can let me know and you if you want you can send me like screenshots of your app to just to help with that accountability piece whatever you feel comfortable with.

11:28:00 Participant: Yeah, that would be good.

11:28:04 Coach: So transitioning to your second goal around, increasing your water intake, what were you hoping for?

11:28:11 Participant: That one's a little bit harder, because I don't feel like I have like a measurable way to track that like, sometimes I drink like from disposable water bottles I've got a hydro flask here. I've got like a refillable like five gallon thing in my fridge. But that one's harder, it's like sometimes I've got like this much water left from yesterday and celebrate that and they'll have a few sips from this and so it's hard to kind of measure it. So I could more consistently say like, I'm just going to use my hydro flask and like all like drink two of them throughout the day or whatever, like, but right now the way it's set up like I don't even know how much water I'm currently drinking because I'm not like it's not measurable. Um, so yeah i think that's kind of the first piece to figure out.

11:29:20 Coach: Um, so, I think you if you as long as you fill up your hydro flask in the morning, like before drinking out of it. I'm also like yeah so just making sure you drink two hydro flasks a day is kind of where you're going with this right.

11:29:40 Coach: Okay. Um, and then also tracking it. So, like, where are you going to note that you completed or that you drank two hydro flasks?

11:29:58 Participant: Yeah, that's a good point, um, the nutritionist has me using My Fitness Pal to track my meals. And I know that you can track water in there too I haven't done it but I know that you can. So I could just like get in the habit of adding that since I'm already adding food there.

11:30:16 Coach: And then what's the you know the ounces of your hydro flask?

11:30:27 Participant: 32.

11:30:31 Coach: Oh, 64 ounces a day. Um, let's see. So we made it measurable obtainable like you have access to water, you have you have the hydro flask. And then the other thing I know you mentioned you drink water bottles like plastic water bottles, I think, in that case just dumping it into your hydro flask could work. Um, I know it's kind of like an extra step but since we're using the hydro flask as a measurement. You want to keep up that consistency. And then, um, so do you want to do this for every day this week or do you want to do it. Like what what seems like a good amount?

11:31:29 Participant: I'm like health wise like it would be good to hit it every day I feel like realistically like saying five days would be good I think there are some days like this morning I had like two cups of juice for example so I'm like I'm getting the hydration it's just not in the form of water. So, I mean let's start with five days and let's kind of see how that goes. Um, but ultimately I think it should be like more of an everyday thing.

11:32:03 Coach: Um, and then. So here's what I have so far so in the next week you will drink. 64 ounces of water for five of the seven days.

11:32:12 Participant: Yeah, and that 64 ounces is like equivalent of two hydro flasks.

11:32:25 Coach: And then you're going to use the My Fitness Pal to track your water intake. And then, you know, the relevant piece like why is this important to you?

11:32:35 Participant: Um, I mean it's all really like just to help me feel better. I feel like I feel like I know that I'm not drinking enough water and I should be drinking more water and so finding a way to make that more attainable for myself is important for my overall health basically.

11:33:02 Coach: I like what you said about like making it more attainable. And, I think, on a similar line like being more mindful about it too can help make it more attainable.

11:33:15 Coach: Um, so what's your confidence scale?

11:33:22 Participant: I'm probably like a seven I feel like right now it's just forgetfulness, like, preventing me from doing it but like, even I mean I've had the same water bottle next to me for what like three minutes now and I've already sipped on it like four times like, I think it's like having it there and knowing like instead of reaching for, you know, I don't drink soda but like the San Pellegrino or the whatever like I can just reach for the water it's right there. Um, yeah I think it's more that I might just forget to do it, rather than that it's unattainable.

11:34:18 Coach: So, yeah, so like those gentle reminders, um, I think, or how do you feel about programming like alarms on your phone or remind like silent reminder so that it pops up as a notification?

11:34:22 Participant: Yeah, that could work, um, there was an app. I forget what it's called now but it basically it was like you have a house plant. And like every time you drink water you like track it like water and so you're like watering your plants, and you have to do it like every day and like X amount every day or else the plant dies basically and it'll remind you, it'll be like your plants dying. So that was kind of cute and that was like a good reminder but I ended up just like falling off the wagon with it. basically, um, yeah I don't know I don't know how effective reminders would be because I feel like it's more like if you're thirsty drink water like if you're bored drink water and less like drink water every 30 minutes. So I don't know, I would have to kind of think more about. Yeah, I feel like what would work there.

11:35:23 Coach: I think it does, it definitely doesn't have to be every 30 minutes but at least, and this is speaking for myself like the day can be just so busy that I don't take the time to like check in with my body and see if it needs water. And so, like, I would probably do one like at 10 o'clock in the morning, 2pm 5pm and then another one at 8pm, so I know those are like my busiest times where I'm more likely to forget to drink water. But also, if Yeah, if you're like, I'm just gonna ignore the reminder it's not gonna...

11:36:05 Participant: Yeah I feel like I, I might like I'm just not really as much of a reminder person. So I might just kind of wing it this week and see how that works and if I feel like it needs more structure like we can structure it more.

11:36:27 Coach: Cool. Um, so you've set really two really good like goals. I'm excited to see how it goes. Um, we're going to meet again I believe next Thursday, let me just double check the time and make sure it works for you. So I have that we're going to meet next Thursday at 6:15 is that right?

11:36:56 Participant: Yeah, that works.

11:37:00 Coach: Okay, cool. And then I'll add your other emails right now actually. Yeah, thank you. Did you end up getting that other invite now?

11:37:11 Participant: Um, yes I did For today at 11.

11:37:18 Coach: Um, I just sent it for this next one so hopefully it'll go through now. Awesome. Cool. Well, if you have any other questions or if you need. Do you need any like resources or additional support from me?

11:37:31 Participant: I feel like I'm good.

11:37:35 Coach: Um, so good luck this week, drink your water, get your steps. You got this.

11:37:42 Participant: Great, thank you. Yeah. Have a good day.

11:37:42 Coach: You too. Bye.

11:38:01 Participant: Bye.
