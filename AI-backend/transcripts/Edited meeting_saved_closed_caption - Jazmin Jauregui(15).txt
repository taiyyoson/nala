18:44:24 Coach: Hello, how are you doing?

18:44:31 Participant: Good. Can you hear me?

18:44:33 Coach: Yeah, is there a small lag? Can you hear me?

18:44:46 Participant: Yeah. Can you hear me?

18:44:49 Coach: Yeah. How are you today?

18:44:55 Participant: Oh, I'm okay. Um, yeah I haven't, I didn't really complete any of the goals, actually.

18:45:11 Coach: Okay. Tell me more. What happened?

18:45:28 Participant: Um, I just like never got to them and yeah I don't know I just like I was like really busy with work, and I didn't schedule a time to workout. Even though I like had time this morning like I want to do my work first and then. Yeah.

18:45:42 Coach: So, that's okay, life gets in the way sometimes. And I hope that you're like letting it go, and like letting it wash away we can start a new day or a new week today.

18:46:03 Participant: Yep.

18:46:05 Coach: We might have some like reflection about like what you can do for the future that maybe could help you meet your goals later. But like, let it go.

18:46:17 Participant: Sounds good.

18:46:21 Coach: So it sounds like you did have a pretty intense week. Can you tell me something about your stress level?

18:46:29 Participant: Um, yeah, I was like, out of 10 I'd say like a lot of work, deadlines. And I like to climb from the study abroad program I was going to apply to. I don't know if I told you but the deadline was like, April 12, and I never saw the email because my dog had died a couple of days before and like I was trying to be with her and then after I just like couldn't do any work. And so I emailed them and they were like sorry but you like. It's too late. So I kinda like I've been bummed about that and then Monday, I like had zero motivation, like I really I couldn't. I went to all my classes that I couldn't be on camera. And then this past weekend was actually pretty good. I didn't really do anything at all I just had. I spent time with my family so I was like that was the best part. We went to like the park and we went to eat dinner and like ice cream so that was nice. But yeah like last week it was just like a lot of deadlines and then Thursday I had, like, a full day from like 8am to 8pm. So I was really tired and then Friday I had a test and midterm for geology class and like that also took a lot of my energy. And yeah, but I didn't take like a walk or anything like I finally wanted.

18:48:19 Coach: So, I think I remember one of your goals from last week was around like doing something for yourself like getting boba. Do you think that like going out with your family was a form of self care?

18:48:40 Participant: Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, because we went out and then we got gelato. I think I told you, gelato occasionally and like that was really good. Like in replacement for boba, it's expensive.

18:48:56 Coach: Yeah. How do you feel about making that connection between like meeting one of your health goals with your family?

18:49:06 Participant: And it was nice, especially because before we kind of were like cats and dogs. But I feel like we've gotten a lot more close and we bonded over it.

18:49:24 Coach: Cool. So, sorry. Um, let me ask you this, like if we do say like you met one of your health goals by going out with your family. On a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did overall in meeting your health goals?

18:49:45 Participant: I mean, I didn't work out at all so I just couldn't get my body to move. But I think I'm a nine because the family part like really played like a really balanced out my week.

18:50:07 Coach: So you would say, Did you say a five or nine?

18:50:14 Participant: Nine sorry I didn't really hear you cut off.

18:50:20 Coach: So, what would you... okay sorry. Before we get into your new health goals, I'm gonna go back and ask about the text messages. What are your thoughts about the text messages this week?

18:50:38 Participant: I like the self care bingo card, that was really nice. Um, let's see. I spent time in nature. I got 8 hours of sleep. I hugged my parents. I drank a cup of tea. I caught up with friends - on Friday night I went out with my friends, so like that was also like a little bit self care because we went out and got like burgers, fries and milk shakes like that was a lot. And then we got we got something else for dessert, but yeah that was really good. I complimented myself. So I had shower, did you want to take like more bath stuff. And, but I will say that I am getting a personal trainer, especially for the summer, I asked my parents and because they have like a lot of personal trainer friends. And so we're going to see if like one of them can train me and I'm thinking of going like two to three times a week, every month, not every morning but like in the morning. So yeah, it's exciting for the summer. When do you start that? Well, yeah, actually did like the picture of like the kitchen. The picture, yeah and I just like seeing like aesthetic Mexican kitchens, like almost like authentic or festive in a way.

18:52:55 Coach: Yeah, yeah definitely the one was like the image stood out to me.

18:53:08 Participant: I know, they weren't, man. But like, for me personally I just associate things better when I see when I visualize it. Or like, when I touch it, like it connects things a little better with the visuals.

18:53:34 Coach: Cool. Thank you. Any other comments about the text messages?

18:53:41 Participant: Oh, I saw one in the morning. Activities jogging or swimming. And I actually do want to try swimming. I want to see if like I can try to get into that, but I know where I would go near my house is good. Yeah, but I but I do want to try swimming.

18:54:06 Coach: That's a good goal, and they're like a future goal, and so it's not quite attainable right now. Do you plan on going to USF in the fall?

18:54:21 Participant: You know the pool at the school gym.

18:54:32 Coach: Yeah, I mean I feel like the first couple times I may be like a little bit nervous cuz I'm on it but yeah definitely I do want to like practice it once a week, but I definitely don't go often. 

18:54:50 Participant: Oh, but the good thing is that my friend she's like, personal trainer, but she's like really good right now. So, my friend and I are going to pay her to train us it's like great for me to get back to us is that correct.

18:55:04 Coach: That is super exciting. It's gonna be like a group, group. Cool. Okay, well, what would you like to focus on this week?

18:55:34 Participant: I think. I don't even know but I just like want to rest, but at the same time, study for finals.

18:55:51 Coach: So, it's okay. Like, I think, a form of, like, there's also everyone's like stressed. So, we can think about your academics as part of your health because it can be like a stressor, but if you focus on it, it could be stress relieving. Yeah. The other thing is like when you're experiencing so much outer stress or like social stress. For example, academics. This is like a critical time to practice self care. So, you know, whether that be like a five minute self care activity or whether that be like a 15 minute, like 15 minutes for yourself during this stressful time might be might be helpful, rather than like destructive. So, if you want to set a goal around sleeping like prioritizing sleep for eight hours, or doing a self care activity or scheduling time for studying, like all of those things could be are helpful this week, not sorry, one of all of those things.

18:57:17 Participant: I'm gonna sleep. I don't come not sleep finally 12 midnight. My body will just crash, like I've tried to stay up to stay up for hours, but I just cannot. Like, I literally open my laptop and I'm going to tell me get this done. From like 12am to 2am, and I crash like I just cannot like I need sleep. So I think setting my bedtime from 12 to seven is one of my goals for this week.

18:58:04 Coach: I think that's a little hard for me to like phrase into a SMART goal Can you do it, like, how do you want me to word it. So in the next week. And then I will on in the next week. I will get seven to eight hours of sleep with a fixed schedule.

18:58:38 Participant: I have learned that like if you sleep eight hours a week, but at different times like it's not, it's not good. Sorry, I didn't hear we said you learned that if you get eight hours of sleep a night or something. But if you get eight hours sleep. But like at different time like it's not good for you because I'm, like, let's say I sleep from 12 to eight and eight. And then the next day I sleep from like 4am like totally like that just that time. That time changes affecting me more than like not sleeping eight hours a day.

18:59:49 Coach: Gotcha. So, for you. Why this goal important is that it helps you with anxiety and depression. And because every time you sleep you  still want to feel more fresh and less jittery. So I'll just repeat the goal, just to make sure I noted it accurately. So in the next week you will get seven to eight hours of sleep a night with a fixed schedule. This means going to bed at 12am and waking up at 7am or 8am sorry.And this goal will help you manage your anxiety and depression, feel less jittery and more refreshed, would you say throughout the day?

19:01:10 Participant: Yes. Also, in the morning, more specific in the morning.

19:01:20 Coach: So, um, what, what structures or what things, will you need to help you meet this goal?

19:01:39 Participant: So, I actually need to log off social media for the rest of the semester. Cuz I think I'm like okay I have three weeks left, I can. I like need to take a break, can I spend way too much time on Instagram, Which is like in a way it's good because I find out like everything that's going on that's not in the news. But at the same time, like, I need, like I just have a lot of work to do. I know that I'm not going to get it done if I check my social media like 20 times a day. So I'm like okay, you have three weeks, you can do it. And then you have three months of like, no school. Definitely, I think, one of my social media will help about, I work on social media, like my job is to manage social media, but it's not like personal social media, just personal social media.

19:02:51 Coach: What, what other things do you think would be helpful to help you meet your goal?

19:03:16 Participant: Maybe like eating like with a routine. So, eating at a certain time, at a certain time, lunch at a certain time and then dinner at certain time, because then eating, like me, snacking so much, not like a million bucks.

19:03:52 Coach: I think that could be like a whole new health goal if you want to be. Um, I think, for, for this one, it might complicate it a little bit. Yeah. So I can give you some other examples if that's helpful. So, um, one thing could be like, signing off your computer, by 11:30, that can help you make sure you get to bed by midnight, or so you can set an alarm for yourself, just so that you can start your bedtime routine.

19:05:05 Coach: Okay so what would help you not ignore them?

19:05:10 Participant: The laptop, like signing off 11:30.

19:05:26 Coach: Is there anything that I can do to help you meet your goal?

19:05:33 Participant: Reminders help. The ones on the calendar or the ones on the phone. Both.

19:05:47 Coach: And then, where would you want the reminders to be what they want, sorry. You couldn't. What would you want me to write in the reminder, and at what time?

19:06:18 Participant: Oh, maybe like for the, for the computer one, maybe one on Thursday night and the minute Friday night at 11:30. If you just want me to do it on Friday on Thursday. Yeah, and also like Sunday and Monday will be me.

19:07:22 Coach: So, on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

19:07:44 Participant: You in a sec let's make it.

19:07:50 Coach: Oh, are you interested in meeting a second goal, making a second goal this week I'm sorry?

19:08:01 Participant: Oh, I don't know.

19:08:07 Coach: I don't want to overwhelm you. So if you're okay with setting one goal I think that's a good starting point.

19:08:16 Participant: Yeah, I think we'll just stay there like that for now.

19:08:23 Coach: Um, so I'll just repeat the goal in the next week you will get seven to eight hours of sleep a night with a fixed schedule. This means going to bed at midnight, and waking up between seven and eight. So, um, this, unfortunately, is our last health coaching session.

19:08:51 Coach: I can't believe it's already been four weeks.

19:08:56 Participant: It's crazy.

19:09:00 Coach: Well, I won't be able to like meet with you again. But I'll still check in with you there through text message and I'll send you those calendar invites, so don't feel like you're alone like I've left you I'll still be here for support. Um, and, and there's in terms of next steps for the program. Sorry, can you hear me okay, by the way?

19:09:34 Participant: Yeah.

19:09:35 Coach: So for next steps, there's two. One is a follow up survey, which is very similar to the first one that you took but it's a lot less time. And then the second step is meeting with another person from the team to do a follow up, or we're calling them like a feedback meeting. So, you would just meet with them to provide your feedback about your experience and anything we can do to improve the program. And so this meeting is usually about 40 to 60 minutes long. Do you think you can meet at this time next week?

19:10:36 Participant: No, Can we do Tuesday. Next week.

19:10:46 Coach: Yeah. What time on Tuesday, anytime before 6pm? So, let me reach back out to the team and see who can meet with you before Tuesday 6pm. Is there a preferred time like, do you want to meet at the lunch hour, or like 3pm?

19:11:21 Participant: Be like 3pm. I can do, anytime after two. And before 6pm.

19:11:44 Coach: So I'll send you a Google invite, um, you should receive the link to the survey. I won't send you the Google invite until you fill out the survey though because we need you to fill out the survey before doing the, the follow up meeting. Any questions about those two things?

19:12:09 Participant: No, wait. So do you graduate this semester?

19:12:12 Coach: No I don't finish until the end of next fall.

19:12:21 Participant: Okay, I'm like, okay, so I will definitely see you around campus hopefully in the fall.

19:12:29 Coach: Yeah, hopefully, if things go to plan. I know you'll see how it goes. But, um, yeah, thanks so much for joining the program, it's been like so nice to meet with you and chat with you and help you like meet your goals I know things are super overwhelming. And this a ton like going through this and going through college, essentially, and a pandemic. So props to you for sticking it through and, you know, taking care of yourself in this way. I do hope that you've learned, like how to set goals for yourself and how to achieve them and like really considering the things that you need. And you know how to take care of yourself like what do you need to like make it through this week.

19:13:21 Participant: Thank you so much, honestly like I have learned that I love taking care of myself, and I think, like, I just know that it's what I want to continue moving forward so yeah I think you're really helping me take that step off, cuz I was always afraid of like doing stuff for myself, so. Yeah. Thank you.

19:13:54 Coach: Yeah, definitely. You gotta, you can't pour from an empty cup. I don't have you heard that saying, you need to fill the fill your own cup. Okay. Well, I'll let you go again so nice to see you.
