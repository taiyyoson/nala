17:06:09 Coach: Hello, can you hear me?

17:06:12 Participant: Yes, I can. I can hear you.

17:06:15 Coach: Okay, cool. How are you doing today?

17:06:20 Participant: I'm good, how are you? Good. Good, I'm glad the workday is over.

17:06:34 Coach: I'm sorry, I don't know if you shared but where do you work?

17:06:40 Participant: I am a case manager for like a travel company.

17:06:45 Coach: Oh yes you did share that, okay cool. Do you normally do like the Monday through Friday nine to five?

17:06:57 Participant: Yeah, eight to five.

17:06:59 Coach: Oh wow, okay.

17:07:02 Participant: Yeah, and we just kind of like went back in the office. We used to be kind of like working from home for a while, so that adjustment from working from home to working back in the office, it's still... still trying to overcome that.

17:07:18 Coach: Yeah, I can imagine. It hasn't happened for me, but I know it's gonna be tough. What do you normally do, like outside of your work time?

17:07:35 Participant: I usually don't really have time to do much. Just work or like prep for school. So just like schoolwork, schoolwork. Throw in meals and... Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off, what were you gonna say?

17:08:09 Coach: Oh no, nothing. I'm just saying like yeah.

17:08:14 Participant: But I have a couple of trips planned for the summer so I'm kind of looking forward to that at least. We're going... And I'm planning to go to San Diego and Joshua Tree. So, I don't think they're kind of like lifting up, so I am kind of... I mean I'm fully vaccinated and like I know that that's not totally... I still, you know, I just don't want to get caught up, but I'm kind of... I feel a little bit more comfortable now that everyone's kind of vaccinating and things are opening back up and I just really need to like get out of Sacramento for a bit so I planned a couple of trips.

17:09:05 Coach: Yeah, I think that's a really great thing to do. And you're trying to do it in the best or the safest way possible, so there's some comfort or comfortability there. Yeah, well that sounds really fun. I haven't been to either of those places, but from photos they just look amazing.

17:09:30 Coach: Well, it sounds like you're driving right now or are you just in your car?

17:09:40 Participant: I guess... so I'm in my car but I'm driving home. I just got off work.

17:09:44 Coach: Okay. Well, I have you on the audio. Yeah, thanks so much for accommodating the change in schedule. Do you feel comfortable just continuing our session while you're driving?

17:09:59 Participant: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I have you on the car audio so...

17:10:07 Coach: Okay, sounds good. Yeah. So I'll go ahead and get started. I'm asking just a few of like the general questions. So you've been receiving the text messages every morning around 9am?

17:10:35 Participant: Yeah there was one of them that I really liked - the one where it was like, kind of like spring's coming in and like kind of go outside, take a break. I really liked that one and then the one yesterday was about fruit. That one really made me think, and so I realized it's also like a healthy way to kind of go about it so I liked that one.

17:11:06 Coach: Cool. I'm curious. So with the spring one kind of promoting taking a break, were you able to take a break in any way?

17:11:17 Participant: Yeah, so for that one I actually... when I was on my walk, I usually do like walks on my breaks at work and so I was on my daily like morning walk and I saw that and I was like "oh like what a coincidence," but yeah, so it didn't... it was cool.

17:11:45 Coach: Cool. Any other comments around the text messages? So then, the other question is around your stress. On a scale of one to 10, how was your week?

17:12:19 Participant:  5.

17:12:22 Coach: So now that we got those questions out of the way, tell me a little bit about how it went with your health goal. On a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did in meeting your health goal?

17:12:44 Participant: So for the self care one I think I really like... I kind of went above and beyond. I think I really kind of emphasized... I ended up finishing my assignments for my class early and so after that I kind of just really tried to do something every single night. And so I went out and bought some face masks and kind of did that every single night. I really definitely met that goal. And I really liked it because it kind of made me really focused on kind of just like having me time, however that looks like. And then for the exercising goal I did meet that one. However, for the exercising one, I think I kind of want to maybe like increase, but... can you read me what the goal is again?

17:13:47 Coach: Yeah, let me have to go back to the email to see what we wrote for that one, so give me one second. So, we had said you would practice... Oh no, sorry, you'll be physically active for at least 30 minutes on two different days.

17:14:19 Participant: Yeah, definitely met that one. I think it was that one as well. I kind of felt good to like meet the goal and kind of like, you know, kind of keep going. I was a little tired at first, but definitely like, once I got like my endorphins like rushing through me like it... I felt really good.

17:14:45 Coach: So there was a lot of positive effects from meeting both your goals?

17:14:54 Participant: Yeah.

17:14:57 Coach: Cool. So you want to speak more to those positive effects from taking care of yourself, or the exercise one? Oh, yeah. So I think it's more like, I'm thinking of it as a reflective question like, what did self care do for you, like, in a positive way? What did exercise do for you, and can it motivate you to continue to do that?

17:15:45 Participant: Like self care, kind of just made me be more in like the present and kind of... I'm much of a like scheduler and try to like plan out things and kind of always try to like keep ahead and so I feel like with self care like it makes me really like being in the present and also realize like, I can only do so much. And so it makes me want to relax and also kind of just like, you know, kind of just to be like, happy and grateful in that like moment. And it also like just brings me joy. And then for exercising I feel like it definitely makes me feel a lot better about myself, like, boosts my self esteem.

17:16:46 Coach: That's really powerful, like you said so many like awesome things like be more relaxed, be more grateful, joyfulness and happiness and like feeling better about yourself and increase your self esteem, like, just those two things. I think making you put in a lot of hard work and I think it paid off.

17:17:14 Participant: Yeah, definitely.

17:17:17 Coach: So, what... where would you like to go with your health goals this week?

17:17:30 Participant: I want to challenge myself to, kind of... because the next two weeks I'm not in class. I definitely want to challenge myself to increase like the amount... exercise-wise I'll try to go, you know, at least like daily if I can kind of just to get back in the routine of things, but also it is going to be challenging because I will be like... I'm traveling this weekend and stuff, but I do also want to find, you know, like ways to do that. And then for self care I think that kind of comes in where kind of just like take care of myself during this... during like, you know, two weeks off.

17:18:30 Coach: So it sounds like you want to keep the same goals, but like, make them a little more challenging, so that you can build a routine?

17:18:42 Participant: Yeah. So like I said, I think instead of two days that I did like, I think I can do like more.

17:19:00 Coach: So, let me write down the first one and then we can circle back to the self care one. So in the next week you will be physically active for at least 30 minutes on four different days. Does that sound accurate?

17:19:22 Participant: Yes.

17:19:23 Coach: Okay. And then, so you mentioned last week that this goal was important to you, because it will help increase your energy and be a healthier person. Do you want to add anything to those to like the relevance or the importance of this goal for you?

17:20:01 Participant: Like this... my like self esteem and confidence level also, yeah.

17:20:14 Coach: Yeah, definitely. Okay, so on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting this SMART goal?

17:20:31 Participant: Nine.

17:20:38 Coach: I think that's really going to help that one. So then, going to your second goal around self care. Previously we had specified in the next week you will practice at least 30 minutes of self care specifically painting on three different days. Did you end up painting, sorry I didn't ask that before?

17:21:23 Participant: I did but I also incorporated other things that kind of like self care, but you know now that I'm thinking about it, I actually want to... I'd just like to leave that one out for next week and just add a different one.

17:21:28 Coach: Yes, you can. You can definitely do that.

17:21:32 Participant: I think something that I kind of like really kind of identified lately on like... like either like kind of like trying to do exercise, kind of exercise and kind of just, you know, that kind of eating out. I kind of forget to meal prep or quote unquote forget my lunch at home in the morning so like I tend to go out for lunch and not choose like the healthiest option. So maybe probably like, just like meal prepping and then like eating... and like, I don't want to be like... at least three times, out of the five days of the week, kind of balancing out like the lifestyle.

17:22:28 Coach: So, do you want to specify lunch, as like the meal that you're going to commit this to, or do you want to be flexible? And we can write this goal a couple of ways as in like, you can reduce your consumption of fast food or increase your consumption of like homemade food or food that you've made yourself. So what feels more appropriate for you like specifying it to like lunch or dinner or reducing or increasing?

17:23:14 Participant: I think, increasing my intake of homemade food.

17:23:25 Coach: So, in the next week you will make three homemade meals. Is that where you want to go?

17:23:38 Participant: Yeah, we could do that.

17:23:40 Coach: Okay, sorry, one more clarification question, if I understood it all correctly?

17:23:53 Participant: And it wouldn't be like, three... three homemade meals a week, but can we just like tie it down to lunch? I usually like skip breakfast. It's just lunch, kind of the meal that I kind of go out to eat or purchase.

17:24:10 Coach: Okay, I think I'm understanding now. So in the next week you will prepare three lunch meals for the week?

17:24:23 Participant: Yeah.

17:24:23 Coach: And then this would like in turn reduce your purchasing of fast food?

17:24:34 Participant: Yeah.

17:24:38 Coach: What are those meals that you like to eat during lunch, that you make?

17:25:02 Participant: It really depends. I mean, I am vegetarian. I usually have like vegetarian or like plant based meals. So it just depends but it's usually something with like veggies and like a carb or veggies with like some sort of protein in it. But, yeah.

17:25:23 Coach: I'm just thinking about like the obtainable aspect of this goal. And so, like, in order for this to be obtainable you want to have lunch meals in mind. And so we're just doing like that prep work like what do you want to prepare for yourself for lunch that you can do at home?

17:25:48 Participant: I think just like veggies, like with brown rice or something and like... I think that's kind of something simple and basic. That's kind of my go-to.

17:26:09 Coach: Okay. If you feel comfortable eating that for lunch for at least three times next week, then I think you're on the right track. And then so going back to like the relevance, why is this goal important to you?

17:26:29 Participant: I think it's important to have that solid diet. I think it's also... if I am choosing to, you know, exercise to also kind of watch what I put in my body. You know, just to be healthier and live a longer life.

17:26:59 Coach: Okay, so I'm just gonna repeat it back to you to make sure that I captured everything correctly. And if there's anything you'd like to add, go ahead and do that. So, in the next week you will prepare three lunch meals for the week. This includes like veggies, brown rice with a side of protein. This will help you reduce your purchasing of fast food and also, like watch what you put in your body to lead a healthier and longer life. And the other thing that's important to you is having like a balanced diet. Yeah, perfect, it got a little wordy but I'll clean it up when I email it back to you.

17:27:52 Participant: That sounds good.

17:27:53 Coach: Okay, cool. So, on a scale of one to 10, what is your confidence level in meeting this SMART goal?

17:28:05 Participant: I'd say nine as well.

17:28:10 Coach: So, for either of your health goals, do you need any support from me, like either text message support or recipes, reminder messages or anything like that?

17:28:26 Participant: If you could send me some, like vegetarian like recipes, like some ideas, that would be nice.

17:28:39 Coach: I can look into this. Do you have like favorite vegetables? Like I'm a big fan of like carrots and broccoli, but there's like such a variety.

17:28:55 Participant: I love bell peppers like bell peppers, onions, like peas. Those are usually my go-to. But I, you know, broccoli and carrots are also good. I'm not really picky with veggies because that's the only thing that kind of fills me up, so I'm here for anything.

17:29:14 Coach: Alrighty, well I'll keep that in mind. Thank you. Anything else in terms of support needed?

17:29:32 Participant: I think you're doing a really good job coaching me. You're keeping me accountable. So, thank you. Thank you.

17:29:48 Coach: So, before I forget, our next health coaching session will be our last one. And so, when would be a good time to meet?

17:30:26 Participant: Can we do Friday, the 14th?

17:30:29 Coach: Yeah, I should be able to do that. Would five o'clock work okay?

17:30:36 Participant: Yeah.

17:30:42 Coach: If you want, we can meet when you get home. What time would that be? No, that's fine. I don't mind.

17:30:57 Participant: No, that's fine. I don't mind. Okay.

17:30:57 Coach: Well I'll send you a text message with the information again. It'll be the same one that I sent today.

17:31:04 Participant: Okay.

17:31:07 Coach: Cool.
