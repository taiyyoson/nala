18:15:45 Coach: Hello.

18:15:50 Coach: How are you? Good, how are you? Good, thank you. Thanks so much for joining me today. Um, I, my name is Jasmine, and I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks. I'd like to provide a quick little introduction, and then we can transition to like the health coaching portion. Does that sound okay?

18:16:13 Participant: Yeah, that sounds good.

18:16:14 Coach: Okay. Also, can you hear me okay?

18:16:19 Participant: Yeah I can hear you.

18:16:19 Coach: Okay, perfect. I'm totally... Yeah. I think there might be like a small lag, but I'm not sure if that's like it my internet connection is bad or if it's something else.

18:16:38 Participant: It's probably my... let me, let me log in on my phone but do you live in, or do you live... I live in Santa Cruz.

18:16:48 Coach: Okay, it's windy out there right now.

18:16:53 Participant: Oh, it's been pretty cold but I don't know about windy.

18:16:57 Coach: Okay, it's windy out here so let me log off here and then I'll be back. I'm gonna log into my phone.

18:17:01 Participant: Okay.

18:17:23 Coach: Can you hear me?

18:17:25 Participant: Yeah, I think audio is a little better too.

18:17:31 Coach: Okay. Oh awesome.

18:17:35 Participant: Yeah.

18:17:36 Coach: So, just to introduce the program a little bit more in case you have questions. Um, So, examine is a two part intervention. One aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages which you should have started receiving. And then, cool. And then the second part is the health coaching aspect. So, in my role as your health coach, I will meet with you once a week, through zoom for about 20 to 30 minutes, I do have a little bit of time beyond that, if it's something that you're interested in. But I want to be respectful of your time so 30 minutes is all that you can provide them like we will keep that time. So during that time I'll check in with you about the text messages, your weekly your weekly health goal, as well as your stress level. Because, based on past experiences. The stress level helps you think about your health and wellness goals but we don't have to go more into that. So, in addition, I'll follow up with you through text in between our health coaching sessions just to see if you're needing any additional support. And also, if any questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise as your health coach. I'll let you know about the limitations in my knowledge and help you get connected to appropriate resource. So the example that I like to give is, you know, therapy. I'm not a therapist, but if that's something that you're interested in connecting with like as part of your health goals, then I can help give them that referral.

18:19:24 Participant: Okay.

18:19:24 Coach: Okay. And also, while this is a research study and we will be collecting data, our specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be de identified so your name will not be part of the study, or with the data. You're welcome to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with. But by the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around problem solving. Goal setting, as a way to as a way for you to feel empowered about your spiritual mental and physical health. So, thank you so much. And then another big thing that maybe hasn't come up is your participation will help us determine whether this is a program that we can offer like at a larger scale and two more students at USF. So, yeah, just want to let you know that there is like a something to look out for and the inter about it. Yeah. With that, do you have any questions?

18:20:30 Participant: No.

18:20:30 Coach: Okay, okay, okay, cool. Um, so I think one good question to help us get started is, um, what motivated you to participate in our program?

18:20:45 Participant: I got the email, and I saw Latina, so I'm trying to be more active with USF. And since I'm in the Sacramento campus we really don't have much going on out here. So I was like, Oh, you know what I'm already like one of my friends, refer me to like a financial advisor, so you know what I'm already working on my finances let me work on my health.

18:21:16 Coach: Yeah, I think that's really good like it helped you become more mindful of like your well being as a whole. Cool. Um, so, in terms of like your health goals or your health and wellness. I guess one question that I will ask you now if that's okay, is on a scale of one to 10. What is your stress level where zero is or sorry, where one is not stressed and 10 is like super stressed?

18:21:50 Participant: I would say like a five.

18:21:57 Coach: That's pretty good Not too much not too little optimal stress. Okay. Well, I like I've mentioned earlier, some people have reported like high stress amounts and then we kind of go into like meditation, more like becoming physically active to like help manage your stress levels, if that's something that you're interested in, we can talk more about that or if you have other health goals in mind, um, you know, what would they be?

18:22:30 Participant: Um, so I think that I'm not all stressed. With this new job, it's, it's stressful but I try to leave it at work. And I work from home but when I do work like on site. I do everything out there, and I started last week, I started running. So good. I have a chance to do that after this. But that helps me a lot. I have been trying to be consistent with working out, but it's hard because I'm not motivated, I have no... I want to get muscular like I want muscular legs but it's like, It takes too long and they have to eat healthy. Um, so yeah I want to eat I don't think I eat as bad as I did before. Um, but yeah I do want to eat a little healthier.

18:23:33 Coach: Yeah, it sounds like the goal around having like muscular legs is like the main goal but you have to create like little milestones to get there. Yeah. And that's awesome. Like so many people are like part of like the fitness world and I'm just in awe about all of them. Okay, so, is that something that you want to like go into like talking about like healthy eating?

18:24:01 Participant: Yeah.

18:24:02 Coach: Okay.

18:24:03 Participant: Sorry. No pressure. I just want to get a little bit.

18:24:09 Coach: Okay, cool. Um, so there's different aspects to healthy eating. You can think about like you want a meal plan like that could be a goal, you want to eat more vegetables like that could be a goal. You know, and anything on that spectrum. Where do you want to start?

18:24:30 Participant: So, I think I know I can do it because for six months, I was eating healthy, And then I just got tired of eating the same thing. So like I was eating turkey or chicken. And I started at the beginning of the year. And then I just got tired of eating the same thing. So, I, I think I need to find like different recipes to keep me motivated to continue eating healthy?

18:25:02 Coach: Okay. Yeah, no worries, um, that's what I like the learning objectives, so I'd be happy to tell you. I'm so smart is an acronym that starts. That stands for. Specific, Measurable, Attainable relevant and timely. So, the timely piece, we usually keep it to for this week you will, and then blank. Or we can do it over the next four weeks, I will. So those are just a couple of examples for the time piece. So do yours health go weekend say like, I will find five recipes to diversify like my, my meals. So that's a way to be specific and keep it measurable so you just find five recipes. We can bump that up to seven bump it up to 10 or bump it down to like a three, something that feels obtainable to you. Does that sound like a good health goal?

18:26:16 Participant: Yeah. Also I also would like to drink more water. I think I have like three water bottles today so maybe pumping it up to five.

18:26:29 Coach: Okay. Yeah. So that's another really good health goal to have, and I'll I'm like with the language piece. Is it okay to write it as like over the next week. So in the next week I will.

18:26:45 Participant: Yeah.

18:26:45 Coach: Okay. So, and when next week. I will and then how many recipes did you want to find and we can devise?

18:26:57 Participant: Okay, I will find five recipes.

18:27:06 Coach: I think, measurable, attainable relevant. And they. I kind of mentioned this before but like, making sure we hit home. Why is this important to you, why is it important for you to find five recipes?

18:27:29 Participant: I would say, to have different options of food we decided to get bored of the same theme. And then I'm not excited. I'm excited to eat the same thing the following day.

18:27:45 Coach: Okay, so you don't get bored. And you get excited to get excited. Okay. And then I think, connecting this to your longer term goal right like. I mean, do I hear the term often but eating clean, does that. Yeah. Is that something that relates to the recipes you want to find?

18:28:14 Participant: Yes. But I'm very picky with my food so I don't know, like, I could eat clean. Every, every day, maybe like three times a week. I usually do like one ever I doing clean. I usually do like Monday through Friday and Saturdays, Sundays would be my cheat day. But it's very hard and I'm Mexican so we don't eat healthy. I love my grandma. So I can eat that. Oh, I'm sorry.

18:28:55 Coach: But to to this maybe we can change it a little bit and, you know, finding these meals will help you get closer to your like your long term goal which is like the muscular legs. So does that will finding these recipes also help you achieve that long longer term goal?

18:29:18 Participant: Yes.

18:29:19 Coach: Okay. I'll just put like also helps achieve longer term goal. Okay. And then you, so you wanted to do, to maybe we can do more if you feel like that's if you feel like that's necessary but in the next week, I will drink. Five water bottles a day. Yeah, that's it. Okay.

18:29:59 Coach: And then, did you want to do that for all seven days, or did you want to do it like three out of the five day or sorry, five to seven days?

18:30:11 Participant: I'll say this seven days.

18:30:18 Coach: Okay. Um, and then any other goals that your health goals that you want to focus on in the next week?

18:30:31 Participant: Um, I, I don't really drink sodas. But I just caught myself having three before this meeting. Go, my God, why do you do, I'm going to have a health session. And I'm going to drink three. So I would like to start working on, not eating so much. Like one, and then.

18:30:59 Coach: Okay. Like one, and then. Okay. Um, so let me, let me think of like how to word this because instead of saying, I will drink one soda a day like maybe I will limit. My consumption of sodas to two sodas a day maximum. a day maximum. And then, do you want this to be in the next week or do you want this to be longer than a week?

18:31:30 Participant: In the next week.

18:31:32 Coach: Okay. So in the next week. Sorry, I'm also typing this up because I send it to you in an email, so that you also have it to reference.

18:32:04 Participant: Okay.

18:32:07 Coach: Um, So one question that we like to ask about like your health goals is like your confidence level. So for your first goal of like in the next week I will find five recipes and you can use to diversify your meals so that you get bored and that you're excited about eating. On a scale of one to 10 one, not being so confident and 10 being really confident. How confident are you in meeting your goal?

18:32:37 Participant: I would say a five, I have Pinterest.

18:32:42 Coach: Okay, so five is kind of like in the, in the middle. And we usually like to have your confidence to be seven or higher.

18:33:04 Participant: I'm sorry. Yeah, I would say like 10.

18:33:06 Coach: Oh okay, cool. Sorry about that, in all our scales are one to 10 so I have been more careful. Okay. And then the next health goal that you set was in the next week I will drink five water bottles a day. Like for the whole for the whole week. Um, what's your confidence there?

18:33:35 Participant: I would say a seven, just because sometimes I have to be on site, and like my job and I can't carry all those water bottles. So if I drink them like one at a time. At the same time, then it's. I don't think I can do it. But if I spread them out throughout the day. Yeah.

18:33:59 Coach: So, one thing that we can do to change your health goals so that it is more achievable, is you can say, I'm going to do this for five out of seven days, and that way if you don't meet your goal for two of the days, even like those are the days that you're at work. You, you still actually like meet your health goal because you gave yourself that flexibility. So, that ultimately it's your choice, but I'm just letting you know that we can change your health goal to be something more achievable.

18:34:40 Participant: Yeah, that makes sense. That sounds good.

18:34:43 Coach: Okay, do. So how many days are you going in next week to work?

18:35:00 Participant: I might be at my house. Always.

18:35:04 Coach: Okay. I don't have anything on my calendar yet. Oh, can I ask where you work? 

18:35:11 Participant: I work for a program called Waking the Village, it's working with homeless youth that are parenting, or pregnant or identify as LGBTQ plus.

18:35:27 Coach: Wow, and you're in Sacramento.

18:35:33 Participant: Yeah, I am a youth employment coach, so I help the youth, find jobs I help them with the resume. I help them go back to school with interviews all that stuff.

18:35:48 Coach: Yeah, wow that's incredible work Thank you so much. And what are you studying here at USF?

18:35:51 Participant: Marriage family therapy.

18:35:56 Coach: Wow. Okay, awesome props to you high fives drink your water, let's make this happen for you.

18:36:06 Participant: Yeah, I need self care, and good health.

18:36:11 Coach: Yeah, and self care can be one of those health goals. You have three this week, and we can add more if you want but self care could definitely be a health and wellness goal.
Okay. So, with that, with not having to go into work. This week, do you still want to do it for the whole week or do you want to, like, reduce that amount down just a little bit?

18:36:40 Participant: Um, we can do the five days.

18:36:42 Coach: Okay, cool. Does that change your confidence level at all?

18:36:56 Participant: Um, I would say no because I'm usually on the weekends it's when I drink less water, but I just wanted to push myself to do it.

18:37:10 Coach: Okay. No worries. Um, so, in terms of like, like thinking of problem solving. What are things that you can do to help remind you to drink these water bottles?

18:37:27 Participant: I have an app on my phone. And it just like tells you, just click on how you drink water and then it also has a reminder. I don't remember what it's called. I think it's just like drinking water I don't remember, but that's what I use I always have my phone with me so that.

18:37:47 Coach: Okay, cool. So, um, I do want a program thats on your phone right now like take a little minute to do that on your phone.

18:38:01 Participant: Yes, Go ahead. You can pause me. Let me look for the app I think I removed it says that drink water. Look for the app I think I removed it says that drink water. It's downloading. It was called drink... give me. It's drink water reminder. Oh, I just downloaded like the first one.

18:39:29 Coach: I think the fact that there's an app for it is super validating or like I'm not the only one who's struggling.

18:39:46 Participant: It's creating my plan, I guess.

18:40:30 Participant: Okay, I did it.

18:40:33 Coach: So it'll, it's like set to remind you, like, every so often to drink your water.

18:40:42 Participant: Yes, and I've been drinking water all day but I just clicked that I had one bottle.

18:40:47 Coach: Okay. So, yeah, I think I'm using water bottles, as like a measurement also fits well with like the SMART goals. And then, oh your last health goal was, you will limit your consumption of sodas to two sodas a day. Um. How confident are you in meeting that health goal?

18:41:16 Participant: I will say seven. Well if I find some recipes that I like and I don't have to eat. My mom makes. I will not be eating.

18:41:36 Coach: So it sounds like you know with your first goal, it's more important that you do that by like end of day tomorrow or Wednesday?

18:41:47 Participant: Yeah, yeah.

18:41:47 Coach: Okay. Something to keep in mind, I will keep. I can change it to say like, by the end of Wednesday, you will find five recipes, but I'll leave it for the next week and. And hopefully you do find the recipes to viewers just putting the word. Um, you know, this is actually the second part. We're doing this intervention. And a lot of people kind of refer to me as an accountability buddy. Um, and so if you want to send those recipes to me whether it's through email or through the text messaging platform. You can say like hey I found this really cool recipe and I can like help you get on track, in a way, but no pressure.

18:42:41 Participant: Well, yeah. That's what I mean because if I need somebody to like bully me type of thing.

18:42:53 Coach: Okay, cool. Well I think you've set really good health goals for this week. How do you feel about them?

18:43:00 Participant: I feel good. I feel I'm ready for it, like I've been like i said i've been trying to do this for the longest time and I'm just lacking motivation and like I said someone to remind me that I have to do it.

18:43:16 Coach: Yeah. So you and I will be checking in, once a week, and then I'll also text you every once in a while just to check in again like hey how's it going Do you need any support. For example, like, Maybe you're needing help finding one last recipe, and I'm like hey there's this delicious salad or like, this is a really savory way of cooking chicken like you can lean on me for that kind of support.

18:43:45 Participant: Thank you.

18:43:45 Coach: Yeah. Um, one thing we didn't get to check in about is the text messages and mostly because you've only received one message, which came in, twice because it didn't schedule to go out. Suddenly happened, I don't know what happened but something happened. And so hopefully you did get the image.

18:44:11 Participant: Yeah, I got it right up for you texted me I was, I was waiting I was like, what's going on like.

18:44:19 Coach: And then when you send me a text again that's when I got it. Okay, cool. So yeah, you'll get a message every day at 9:30, hopefully they're, like, errors like that don't happen. I'm the one who like schedules them. So, that was totally on me. I don't know what happened though. Um, but you're welcome to reply to them and say, like, give it a thumbs up if you liked it, or you're, if you're like, Oh, this was like such a nice message, whatever the case may be. I will see that. And just know that someone is on the receiving end.

18:44:58 Participant: Yeah.

18:45:00 Coach: Um, other than that, I know we're at time, but do you have any questions or. Yeah, any other things you want to check in about. So I do use the same zoom. But if, would this time next Monday work for you?

18:45:40 Participant: I'll prefer a little earlier, just because I was going to be at work. And I was like, driving from downtown to my house is probably going to take like an hour. But yeah, I should be in my house on Mondays and that we can run.

18:45:45 Coach: Oh, OK, cool. So yeah, I can schedule our next three sessions at four or 5:15.

18:45:51 Participant: Yeah, that sounds good.

18:45:53 Coach: Okay. And then I'll just have it be reoccurring on the calendar so that you get like the notification and yeah.

18:46:01 Participant: Okay.

18:46:03 Coach: Cool. Awesome.
