18:16:13 Coach: I'm doing good how are you?

18:16:14 Participant: I'm just tired.

18:16:15 Coach: Okay, that's totally valid, this Thursday, middle of the semester. Yeah, that's true, a year into a pandemic, you know, the above. I like your sweater though.

18:16:29 Participant: Oh, thank you. Um, I don't remember where I got it, but it kind of reminds me like Patagonia style stuff right yeah and like it snaps up. It was pretty comfy I gotta admit. You're located in like SF area right?

18:16:55 Coach: I'm down in Santa Cruz. Oh, it's not super cold here but my apartment gets pretty cold. And then like I was just in bed I just got a new cat. So we were just in bed and then every time I get up I'm like freezing. She'll probably walk across the screen at some point, she's pretty friendly.

18:17:21 Participant: So you became a cat mom.

18:17:25 Coach: Exactly I keep calling myself mommy I'm like, oh mommy's gotta get up now like. Mommy's eating that's not yours. I'm like, Oh, I'm in deep. But that's okay like the transformation has begun. Really, three days into cat ownership and like what am I going to be like with an actual child, but yeah she's fun. She came named Taiga. It's T-A-I-G-A. And she's 15, so I was like we're just going to keep the name like she's, she's not really responsive to it but I was like whatever she's, she's had it and I like it and so what sounds pretty badass.
Yeah, pretty cool. I'm also super excited about - were you getting a tattoo right?

18:18:26 Participant: Oh yeah I did, I got it on Saturday. It was good, it's, it's starting to itch. Just like the process was just annoying I have to like avoid scratching it. So I'm like scratching it like through my pants so that I don't mess it up. But what it went well, it was like three hours over this past weekend and then we'll do like two or three more hours to color it in, in a couple of weeks. So, yeah, it went up, it's like, almost bigger than I thought it would be. And so it's gonna be like wearing shorts all summer my family's gonna be like what. What's that, whatever, that's fine. I'm excited.

18:19:13 Coach: I also will promise you when I got my tattoo it's tiny I don't know if you can like see it. I used to put chapstick on it to like help with the itching.

18:19:29 Participant: That's very smart. I'm like, allergic to a lot of lotions and stuff so I have to be super careful about what I put on it but I bought Aquaphor yesterday and I've been using that. And then just trying to wear like soft clothes or like this is a dress I put on pants with it but last night I like didn't wear pants with it just so it could like breathe a little bit. But yeah, it's like, it's a process. But it's good. I'm excited. And I know it's not my body, but I'm excited for the result.

18:20:06 Coach: Yeah, I like it, I like I'm happy with it, so far so it's good. Um, well, can you believe it's already our third coaching session?

18:20:22 Participant: No, it's hard to believe. It's kind of wild. This one was a little bit harder to track - it wasn't as hard to do, but it was a little bit harder to like measure. Specifically, I'm like I feel like I drink more water than I track, but that one was harder, and I know we talked about like the one Hydro Flask but then like I drink water outside of that as well and so like for example last Friday night I went out drinking. And I know how much fun it was, that wasn't gonna say a mistake but it wasn't a mistake, it was like an undergrad college like haven't been that messy in a long time. Looking back, fun, and like I know I drank tons of water, but it was like out of glasses and out of, you know, a plastic water bottle and so I'm like I can't even quantify how much I drank. And that kind of came up a couple of times and then also I know we talked about this too like when I start my day when it's half full, I just like finish it and I refill it and then it's like whoa was that 32 ounces or was that you know 20, whatever. That one was just a little bit harder to measure but I thought it was a good practice so I might keep that goal. And then the steps one was easy to measure because my phone does it for me. But it was a little bit harder to do so like yesterday I didn't have enough steps basically and had to run an errand in the evening and was like oh I'll just walk instead of driving and like got the steps in that way but that one I had to be more mindful. So I honestly might keep that one too. Um, let's see, I think what was the day that we met last week, I believe it was Thursday. So I hit it, I got 4000 steps Thursday, Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. It was four days right - it was four, I forget what we said it was for yeah yeah I hit it it was just like I had to be a little more intentional about hitting that one, as opposed to just happening naturally. Um, but yeah I mean I liked them both and I feel like they were kind of the right level of challenging that like I had to actually do it, not just something I was kind of already doing.

18:23:13 Coach: So, on a scale of one to ten how do you think you did in meeting your goals?

18:23:24 Participant: The steps one I'd say like, probably a nine or ten. There were some days where I like barely scraped by or I got like 4010 steps. Oh, I need to like do this before I go to bed. But I technically hit that goal, and then the water one probably like a six or seven, I think I was looking at it right before the call I think I got maybe four days worth of water but not all four of those days hit 64 ounces, but it was also like did I track everything or did I actually not drink that much water. So that one's a little bit lower, but still, still overall accomplished.

18:24:18 Coach: Yeah, I think I'm like looking at the barriers right - you identified the measuring or the tracking one. The water goal was a challenge so it makes sense why it was hard to, it's hard to gauge like how successful you were or if you achieved it. I wonder, like, I'm not a big fan of like using plastic water bottles but like if we had said like plastic water bottles that are like already filled for you, you can start a fresh one, it would have been easier, maybe easier to see the progress. Or maybe saying that, like, a number of glasses or like sip of water 20 times a day, I don't know, like, neither of those would have been easy to quantify either but I think it would have been a little bit less restrictive than like it has to be this 32 ounce Hydro Flask, you know. And I also heard you like want to keep working on these goals and maybe even continue them for this week.

18:25:32 Participant: Yeah, possibly, probably, I was trying to think of other ones and I'm like, I can't, I don't know if there's something else. Well, maybe I like made a meal plan last night for the upcoming week. I'm going out of town next weekend. So like a week from tomorrow. So I want to finish up like the food that I have in my fridge and stuff. I also ran out of my Uber Eats money from work for the month. I'm on my own food wise. So I made the plan like sticking to the plan would be a good goal, because I feel like it's hard and like today, I know what I want to make for dinner like I had a Hello Fresh kit delivered today. But like an hour or two ago I was like, ooh, I'm craving like a sandwich from the sandwich spot I like. I'm just like oh I could technically like there's nothing stopping me from going and doing that, you know, I bought the ingredients like I could make it. Yeah, that's just more labor intensive.

18:27:02 Coach: Um, but yeah, how long does it take you to like make a sandwich vs order and have it delivered, or go get it?

18:27:02 Participant: That's a good question. This one's not on Uber Eats and so I would actually have to go drive and get it, probably be like, at least 45 minutes if not like an hour to like leave here go order wait for it, pick it up and drive home like it would take less time to make it. It wouldn't be as satisfying, but it would also be healthier. So yeah, I mean it's pros and cons to weigh and it's not the meal that I put on the tracker for today you know and so then I would have to punt that to tomorrow or whatever because I don't want this food to go bad either. But yeah, I don't know maybe sticking to the tracker would be a good one for this week just because I already feel like I'm going to struggle with it. And having some level of accountability might make that a little bit more attainable.

18:28:05 Coach: And, um, the other thing I'll add, because you didn't mention like wanting to be less wasteful. So if you make your meal tonight, it'll help you meet that like goal too, like, you're not going to waste your food. You'll save a little bit of money, save a lot of time because 45 minutes is a good chunk of time. And also you can pick another day. Once you get that Uber Eats money to go - oh wait, it's not on Uber Eats. 

18:28:05 Participant: It's a restaurant that's near home so when I'm home next weekend like I could go there and you know like it could be like, not a reward but like a special occasion kind of a thing instead of like I'm just craving it on Thursday night because I'm tired and hungry, you know. Hey stop scratching my couch. No how much their discussion posts for you. Taiga, get your stuff together. Hey, then. Come here. Sorry, I thought you were scratching again I didn't mean to yell at you. I'm sorry. I love her but she's kind of a brat. And she's funny she gets into things like I wouldn't think she could get into.

18:29:21 Coach: But typical for a cat.

18:29:21 Participant: Yeah, exactly. Like she got into the bathroom cabinet the other day and I was like, how did you even manage to do that. She's a big cat. Yeah, she is she's a cutie. And she's stubborn she's a little grandma she's an old lady. So, you know, the older they get the more they're set in their ways, pretty much. And like I'm going to have to clip her nails at some point and I'm just like, oh, I don't know how we're going to do that. But I guess we'll figure it out.

18:30:11 Coach: Are you gonna get her like a little leash or harness?

18:30:11 Participant: I don't know if she would let me. I've got a collar for her but I haven't tried to put it on her yet. She's very sensitive about her back, like she doesn't want you to touch her back or anything, so I don't know how she would do with like a harness. Yeah, but she sits at the door she watches the birds which is fun. And then mostly she naps.

18:30:32 Coach: That's a good goal in life - naps.

18:30:32 Participant: I'll be working and I'm like dang I wish I could nap all day instead. Like, I'm working so you can have a better life, you know. Oh, you're coming back. Don't touch that plant.

18:30:55 Coach: Okay. So, let me, I'm going to kind of go in a little random order. I have like those like standard questions I have to ask, and then we'll go back to your goals. So on a scale of one to ten, what was your stress level this week?

18:31:19 Participant: Last weekend was really awesome and was really low stress but this work week has been pretty busy. Probably like a five, averaged throughout the week.

18:31:37 Coach: And then, trying to think about the text messages. Which ones did you like? Which ones stood out to you, and did any of them motivate you towards doing anything?

18:31:52 Participant: Good question. I liked the one about like grabbing some fruit, as something sweet. Saturday or Friday. And I saw the one today about like mindfulness and yoga. I like the ones that have like little drawings on them I think they're cute. Um, I don't, I'm looking at them now I don't think any of them like inspired me to do anything or like motivated me to change. Um, I like when you text and check in, like, how's it going with steps, you know, um, and then yeah I did, I like the sweet treat one, I was like oh grapes. Um, but yeah, I think I tend to like, I get texts from like different companies and stuff and so like numbers that like want you to do something I'm just like delete, and so I like let them sit all day while I'm working and then like 3 or 4pm like I kind of click through all of them. And so I feel like it gets kind of lumped in with that as well that sometimes I'm just not like you know ready to read it and process it and do something about it it's just more like oh another notification.

18:33:27 Coach: So, yeah, no, but quick follow up question to that. Um, so we have these messages like scheduled to go out at 9:30 in the morning, every day. Do you feel like it would have been better if we sent like asked you like, when's a good time to send this message and then sent it to you at that time or do you think like because you're a busy person like it's just gonna you're just going to check it, at any time, any variation of that?

18:33:51 Participant: Yeah, that's a good question. I think that would help because I would say like 8:30 would be better like before I start work or like the evening would be better when I'm kind of winding down and like, actually, on my phone. Um, I think throughout the workday like my personal stuff just kind of piles up and then I check it all at once at the end of the day, and so like anything during work hours is just kind of going to get pushed aside.

18:34:19 Coach: Sorry, one second. Okay, I'm so sorry, give me like one additional second, I have a roommate and they've entered the room so for your privacy just one second.  I'm so sorry. Okay, we're fine. I'm like this is why I don't have roommates.

18:35:20 Participant: Yeah. I think we have, like, I'll just tell you because we're friends, but like my office is upstairs. He has an office downstairs, mine just happens to be in the bedroom. Like, he knows the door's closed like it's business time and just. Anyways, so I apologize.

18:36:03 Coach: No, you're fine. That would be hard that setup to like, like because that should be your private space but it should also be their private space and it's like there's no common like neutral space. That would be challenging.

18:36:09 Coach: Yeah, it is. I appreciate your understanding. But okay, cool. Well, I think that was helpful, and it's good feedback, because, you know, this is a pilot study and so we're trying to learn as we go. And if we do end up doing this again, or at a larger scale, maybe we could program it to be more specific to what the participant wants. So, going back to your health goals this week. You've mentioned three already which they're all kind of like a lot. Do you want to take it away, where you want me to go with this. I'm wondering if three might be too many. I know normally we do two.

18:36:57 Participant: It might be doable though because two are kind of carrying over and so they're kind of already implemented like the groundwork's kind of been laid. And I can't think of one of them that I would say like let's drop that one, you know. So let's start with the water one, because I think that one is going to be the trickiest to track or make measurable. Um, let's start there and then see like how it all goes.

18:37:34 Coach: So, in the next week, you will drink. How do you wanna, you wanna.

18:37:47 Participant: We can leave it the same, because I can guesstimate, like, how many ounces a plastic bottle is or glass, you know, and the app that I'm using to track it like lets you put in different sizes like different containers and so that would be fine. Yeah, we can leave it the same and leave it at like 64 ounces a day. I feel like four days is still good. Maybe we said five for that one I don't know. Yeah, I think it's drinking it and tracking it because some days I'm like, I drink it and other days I get to the end of the day, and I'm like, oh, I didn't track anything, trying to go back and remember and like I said drinking water is kind of mindless and so then I have to be like, oh, did I refill it today or did I not and I think yeah.

18:38:50 Coach: Kind of makes me wish there were like a water bottle that would just like that would track it for you.

18:39:04 Participant: Good idea that exists, I think it's just like crazy expensive.

18:39:14 Coach: Start let's do a startup, let's go. You know how people do like the gallon challenge, where they just chug the whole gallon and you can see it, you know, trying to think I thought maybe I had another water bottle that had like markings on the side but I don't think I do. Okay. So you'll drink 64 ounces of water in a day. Do you want to do it for five days, the whole week what sounds good?

18:39:38 Participant: Um let's do five.

18:39:45 Coach: And then, a quick kind of reflective question. Did you notice like any positive effects of, you know, drinking more water or being more mindful of your water drinking?

18:40:00 Participant: Good question. Um, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for your study but I got super drunk last Friday and I didn't wake up hungover because I also drank a lot of water like that evening and the next day, and I donated blood over the weekend and I got a tattoo over the weekend and like all of those things require that you're pretty hydrated and so I knew like, because I'd been drinking more water that my body was in a better shape to handle all three of those things which were like, traumatic - not the right word but they like affect your body pretty strongly and so knowing that like my water intake directly impacted like all three of those activities. And I could like go out and have a fun time and like still feel okay like directly because of my water consumption like I felt like that was good. Throughout this week, I think, I feel less inclined to reach for like a sugary drink. Um, so if I'm like eating lunch at my desk instead of like pouring a glass of orange juice or grabbing like a San Pellegrino or going to Kombucha or whatever, like my water's already right there and so I tend to gravitate less towards, maybe unhealthier options.

18:41:40 Coach: Cool. Yeah, I think that last one is really like, oh, that's a juicy data piece. And, so, uh, I think the other thing, and I don't want to like put words in your mouth but it was really impressive to me is that this is a goal that you want to do again. Like, I think that says a lot too. And so, whether it be like the tattoo or like the hangover, or because like you donated blood like all of these had really good, positive outcomes, essentially.

18:42:19 Participant: So, sorry. Okay, it's kind of funny if we picked this goal a different week like I wouldn't have had all three of those things, you know, I don't know if I would have been like, oh I just had to pee more, you know like, because I don't feel anything else I don't feel like my skin cleared up or I'm, you know, more energized or any of those things like, I think it's funny that like the way it lined up like it just happened to be really perfect timing for what I needed to do to kind of set my body up to not freak out last weekend.

18:42:52 Coach: Yeah, I think that's a good observation too, uh, what is it serendipitous. Okay, so, um, would you say that this, these are the reasons as well as to like, why it's relevant for you to keep. Or like, is there another like important factor to you having this goal?

18:43:22 Participant: Um, I feel like it's mostly just like knowing that it's good for me and knowing that I haven't like mastered it yet, um, whereas like last week with the sleep goals I was kind of like, oh, I'm good. You know, I figured it out like the structure didn't really work for me but like the problem itself was solved and so like we're moving on and this one. Both of them kind of feel like they're still rocky and I like to feel like I've got something kind of firmly under control. And so I think that that's kind of the biggest motivation for doing it again is just like, I kind of accomplished it but like it's not quite there yet and I know like that this is something that is good for me and that like has positive health outcomes and that even affects me like peripherally like drinking sugary beverages or, you know, whatever. So, those are kind of the biggest driving factors.

18:44:24 Coach: Yeah, I like your growth mindset. Okay, so on a scale of one to ten what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

18:44:42 Participant: I'm like an eight. Like I already had a good go round of it. I was technically successful and like I just want to be more successful.

18:44:55 Coach: I'm realizing now that we didn't specify like which of the five days. Was that something that you were interested in doing?

18:45:04 Participant: I don't think so. Cuz I don't know, like it kind of just ends up working itself out like oh that day I, you know went out for coffee and I got boba and I went out for drinks and so I like didn't drink as much water but I drank a bunch of other stuff. So I don't think I could even specify certain days.

18:45:19 Coach: Yes, um, is there anything that I can do to be supportive of this goal?

18:45:30 Participant: That's a good question. Um, I think just checking in, like, even at like different times throughout the day like, how's the water thing going? Hey like do you refill your water bottle yet today, you know, I think a lot of it is just like forgetfulness and I'll leave the house - this happened like twice this week I left the house and I forgot to bring it with me. And as soon as I got in the car I was like I want water and I don't have any water. So one of the times was right before my tattoo appointment and I knew I would need water and so I called my sister who I was picking up and I was like, yo, bring me some water. And the other time it was just out running errands and I just like didn't have any for a couple of hours. Um, so I think like, just a reminder helps, I'm not - when it's there when I'm thinking about it or I might even add like a reminder to my phone maybe like a 9pm like track water or drink water, because it's just, it's not that I don't want to do it, I just like forget.

18:46:47 Coach: So, there's a couple of ways that I can, or, I guess, is it better to do like a text message to check in, or like, send you like a Google invite, and say like, hey track your water, and then I can send it out at a specific time every day at a specific time?

18:47:13 Participant: I think the text helped more. My calendars are all weird because like I use my work calendar primarily and like even for these like zoom calls like sometimes they show up and sometimes they don't. And so it'll just like disappear into the wasteland of my email inbox. So I set myself a reminder on my phone for like 9pm every day to just like drink and track water, because that's kind of about the time when I'm like, maybe I'm tracking my meals or maybe I'm like lying in bed watching TV and it's just like the little reminder that I feel like would be helpful. And then yeah, you just texting like however often like and just at random times like that would be like drink your water. Exactly like, I know you haven't had any water yet today. If you haven't peed five times you're not hydrated. Drink more water.

18:48:16 Coach: So, let's. I think that's a good. I can definitely do that. And then for your second goal after the water thing, do you want to move into the, the walking or the steps I mean, or the food?

18:48:43 Participant: Whichever.

18:48:46 Coach: Okay, let's go with the steps, because I feel like that one was a little more solid goal. So you will figure out how we phrased it last time, walk. Yeah, 4000 steps a day four days a week I think tracking it like using my phone. Okay, so, I'm curious. Is there anything that you want to do differently about this goal for example like bump it up to like 4200 or bump it up to five days or anything like that? No pressure here.

18:50:10 Participant: Yeah, let's increase the step count but let's leave the days the same. And I think most days I already hit 4200 so like the four days this last week were 7900, 4074, 4260 and 5665 so it's already like most of them are over that threshold so maybe we say like 4500. Yeah and leave it at four days a week because like some days are just not happening.

18:50:55 Coach: And then, the same question as before, like, did you notice any positive outcomes from having this goal or what's motivating you towards keeping this goal this week?

18:51:11 Participant: Yeah, I know that like days that I actually get out, um, I feel more energized than like the days when I don't leave my apartment all day, um, and I'm trying to think I'm like why did I bring my steps so high last Friday - things you do when you're drunk. But anyway, I'm like I know the days when I like get, you know, triple digit steps like that I feel awful. I'm inside all day and I think it's just like feeling better feeling more energized, feeling more productive throughout the work day like those are the days when I end up like working at my desk and I'm kind of doing the other things that I want to do. So like yesterday for example I worked all day and then I had class and then I needed to hit these steps. So I walked to go pick something up from the neighbors. And then I went to the grocery store after and like normally on a Wednesday like I wouldn't get that many things done because I would just like veg out all day and I get like 700 steps. But knowing like not only that I had to hit this goal but that I like would be more productive and would feel more energized if I did kind of motivated me - after class I laid in bed for like 15 minutes and then I was like, okay, time to go like, I feel like there are a lot of factors. Cool. But yeah, that was kind of the idea. The motivation surrounding it.

18:53:00 Coach: So it's really like relevant to you or relatable to you because you were able to feel more energized, feel better, more productive and like do more things that you wanted to do. So on a scale of one to ten what's your confidence level in meeting this goal?

18:53:27 Participant: I'm probably like an eight, I know I'm going up to the city this weekend so I'm like that day I'll probably get it, going to dinner for my sister's birthday on Tuesday and I'll be like, downtown Menlo Park so probably get it done. And then like the weekend is flexible so I could definitely fit in like the farmers market or running errands or whatever, I'm good. I love the farmers market. So I think I'm confident I think, I think that the slightly increased threshold, I remember why I got so many last Thursday. My sister was here - two sisters were here, and one had to take a zoom call so the other one and I had to be out of the apartment for like an hour and a half. We walked to pick up dinner in downtown Mountain View, it's like a mile away. So it ended up being like an hour and a half long walk. And we got dinner at the end of it and I had blisters from my Birkenstocks from walking that far but it was good. It was nice and then like to get dinner at the end of it, too, was cool so I think like having those sorts of opportunities and knowing like even tonight I need to run like just down the block - it's not even 4000 steps but like to pick something up from a different neighbor. So I think it's attainable. I think like an eight, and I think that like saying 4500 instead of 4000 is like just challenging enough that I'll actually have to plan it and execute it rather than just kind of having it happen without too much intention behind it.

18:55:13 Coach: Cool. I like the way you think. Okay, so, um, is there anything that I can do to support this goal?

18:55:27 Participant: Um, I think this one's the same just like checking in, um, it could be less frequent it could be you know a couple of times throughout the week and just being like, hey, how many days are you up to or like, I liked when you said like send me a screenshot of your steps that were pretty high. I was like, yes, like, I like just scraping by feels like, you know, I'm not gonna like bragging about that but like doubling it like oh yeah I can brag about that. Like just the accountability helps. Just checking in.

18:56:06 Coach: So, I feel like we've made these goals like each of these goals, slightly like more challenging so with the water up to five days, and with the steps, bringing it up by 500. Um, what are your thoughts about adding that third goal?

18:56:24 Participant: And I think we should do it because I'm going to do it anyway and so like, adding that level of accountability again and having like, yeah, having it like actually planned out versus just saying that I'm going to do it. I feel like will make it more attainable.

18:56:50 Coach: So, in the next week, you will, or I will, how would you like me to fill it out?

18:56:58 Participant: Yeah, um, maybe like I will stick to my meal plan, at least five of the next seven days. I don't understand the Google. You heard?

18:57:22 Coach: So, tell me a little bit more about your meal plan - is it like breakfast, lunch and dinner, or just dinner?

18:57:48 Participant: Breakfast is kind of sporadic every day for me like I'm working so I'll either order something or I'll reheat leftovers or honestly lunch is kind of sporadic for me too like today I had real breakfast but I had like hummus and pretzels for lunch. Um, so yeah, I planned it out as lunch and dinner and I left like some space for breakfast to be kind of whatever it wants to be. I went to the grocery store last night and I did buy a couple of breakfast things that I'm like looking forward to having. This breakfast place near my grandparents house had these really awesome breakfast sandwiches that had like sriracha mayo and grilled onions on them. And I was like I can make that so I bought like sriracha mayo and hamburger buns. So like that's one of the things that like all I have to do when I'm craving it basically. So I planned out lunch and dinner and I left some spots for like leftovers and then I left like Saturday I know I'll be out with a friend so like planned on going out that evening, and then Tuesday for my sister's birthday planned on going out that evening. So I plotted in some like flexibility with eating out or eating leftovers or kind of eating whatever. I already kind of botched what I was going to have for lunch today, um, but like, that's okay the dinner plan today matters more for me. I also like need to cook some chicken that's about to go bad in my fridge. And so I planned to cook it tonight to eat it like for lunch tomorrow, and then to make like a chicken parmesan thing with it over the weekend, I think. So like planning ahead to not like throwing out, you know, two pounds of chicken.

18:59:35 Coach: So, um, the way that we're going to measure this, how do you want to measure this?

18:59:41 Participant: So I've got it written down it's like on like a weekly planner sheet, and I was just gonna like check them off, honestly, um, so just being like, it's two meals a day, times the next seven days basically so like I'll stick to 10 of the meals, and really just like checklist it off so I was gonna probably magnet it to my fridge or something and it's very manual it's like pen and paper.

19:00:14 Coach: The other thing I was thinking of, because I know you mentioned like sending the photos or like me asking for the photos. You can say like, you can text me like a photo of the meal that you made, or ate. For example like you know you're making the chicken tonight so you'll be like, this is the chicken or actually, it might make more sense if you send it to me like before you ate it.

19:00:41 Participant: Like, this is my empty plate, but it was a meal off the meal plan.

19:00:50 Coach: That sounds like a good idea. Um, the other thing I was going to suggest is you can send me a photo of your meal plan too so that way I can be like hey, you were planning on eating this time. You're looking over your sandwich.

19:01:10 Participant: Yeah, that works right now but awesome.

19:01:16 Coach: Okay. And so it's attainable. And we're measuring it. And then the relevant piece, just some things that you highlighted in the beginning, or like not wanting to be wasteful. Um, what are other reasons, or why is this important to you?

19:01:43 Participant: Yeah. One of the things I'm making this week is like knock off Chick-fil-A sandwiches. So like, not spending money at Chick-fil-A is important to me. So I'm like I need to eat this chicken. There's no really ideal, I'm looking forward to eating this chicken like I'm not craving like chicken and vegetables or whatever but I was like if I could make it like, not necessarily fun but like something that I crave and not give Chick-fil-A my money like, that's kind of it, like two birds one stone. Um, yeah. Money is a factor in some of it's like money I already spent so like I already spent all this money on like the Hello Fresh kit and groceries and so to throw it out would be a waste of that money but also to order delivery out of my own pocket for the next week would be a waste of my money. Yeah. And just to kind of make better use of my time I think like right now I told myself like oh I don't have time to cook and after work I'm like I just want to crawl into bed and watch TV but if I'm looking at it I'm like oh I'm just going to take 20 minutes to prep this and pop it in the oven or whatever. I need to make like next week for example I need to make a lasagna for an event anyway and so I was going to like make one to give and then like make myself a small one like for my own dinner on Monday. So like two birds one stone, really. So, time management, money management, not being wasteful.

19:03:38 Coach: I think time management and money management are really relevant to health, but would cooking at home or following your meal plan benefit you in other ways health wise?

19:03:53 Participant: Yeah, that's a good question. I think so, I think it's just like healthier alternatives so like I said with this sandwich that I'm craving like if I make it at home it's probably like four or 500 or 600 calories if I go out and buy it, it's probably like eight, nine, 1000 calories. Same with several of these like the Chick-fil-A sandwich you know I'm like, I'm going to coat it with like milk, eggs and flour and then put it in the air fryer instead of like deep frying it so it's healthier. So like the cooking style is different too. Yeah, more control maybe. Definitely, yeah more control. I like cooking too I think it's like, I don't know if soothing is the right word but it's like something that I enjoy doing and I know that I enjoy doing it, even when I'm like trying to avoid doing it because I'm tired. And so I know it makes me feel like happy, or good or whatever. I'm cleaning up not so much so I'm like kind of dreading that but that's okay. Um, so yeah I think I think it has health benefits I think that those matter but I don't think that they're like the primary motivators here, especially like this week.

19:05:25 Coach: Yeah, I think it's good to be mindful of that and also, we'll check in next week to see like, like just a reflection of it essentially. Okay, so sorry my scale question is coming back, on a scale of one to ten what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

19:05:56 Participant: Um. The one thing I was gonna say was like, there are some days when I might mix it up like I might eat tomorrow's dinner today and today's dinner tomorrow and I want to like kind of give myself the space to do that without like saying that I failed, you know, so I'm looking at it more holistically, more like 10 of these meals out of the next 14 instead of like one of the next one to out the next two you know. And so I think like with that in mind, I'm pretty confident like probably a seven, that if I felt like I was trapped in by it I think that would make it more difficult because I would say like, oh man, I'm really supposed to cook that steak tonight but I really really just want sushi, you know, whereas if I said like, oh, I can cook the steak tomorrow and just have leftovers today like that would make it a little bit more attainable and give me a little bit more control and flexibility so, yeah.

19:06:52 Coach: So I'll change the goal to say like in the next week you will follow your meal plan for 10 meals out of 14 meals.

19:07:04 Participant: It's worded a little differently but we'll know what we mean.

19:07:11 Coach: Um, and then was there anything I can do to support this goal?

19:07:16 Participant: I think you already mentioned them so just like I can send pictures, you can, yeah, just checking in, positive feedback like those sorts of things.

19:07:42 Coach: Um, so I will send you an email with all of these. Um, and then I'll check in with you later. One question that's related to next week's appointment. I'm not available on Thursday, I like accidentally messed up my schedule. And so I was gonna see if you were available either Wednesday or Friday.

19:08:07 Participant: Both are rough. On Wednesday I have class so it's just kind of always a struggle and then Friday I have an early morning flight, and I'll be with my family all day. So, I couldn't do either. Monday?

19:08:24 Coach: Monday early morning, would you want to do Monday evening?

19:08:33 Participant: I could. Yeah, I could do like early evening. I typically have a call with my therapist at 7:30 so I could do like the five or six o'clock hours.

19:08:45 Coach: Okay. Yeah, let's do 5:15, be okay?

19:08:49 Participant: Yeah. On May 3rd?

19:08:56 Coach: Um, I think it might like mess up your text message schedule a little bit, but I don't think we're like too far off like your text messages end on Sunday and then we would meet Monday.

19:09:07 Participant: Okay, or something like that, something to that effect. Yeah, no problem.

19:09:13 Coach: So, I'll send you this. And hopefully you do get notified to your email.

19:09:21 Participant: Yeah, yeah, hopefully, we'll see. It's the same Zoom link anyway right?

19:09:32 Coach: Totally. Just copy that from today's just in case. Well, thank you for meeting with me, and I hope you have a good week. Good luck with your health goals, drink a lot of water, and I will see you next Monday. Next Monday. Yeah, like 10 days from now.

19:09:56 Participant: Yeah.
