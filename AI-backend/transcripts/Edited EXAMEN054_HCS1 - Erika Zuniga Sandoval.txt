09:09:35 Participant: Hi. Sorry I shouldn't have started cleaning, because I can't hear you. I hear you now. Okay, I said sorry I had to go move my car because of street cleaning really quick.

09:10:14 Coach: Oh no, no worries, maybe something came up. I figured something had come up, like, oh wait, see what about that. No thank you, thank you so much for being able to make it and we have time, and my schedule is flexible this morning. So we can still do the allotted time so no worries. So I'll start just by giving you a little introduction about the program itself, and sort of what we're going to be working on today. How does that sound? Good. Well my name is Eddie Gallagher, and I'm going to be your health coach for the next four weeks. As you've noticed, this is a two-part intervention. One aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving. The other part is to meet with a health coach—that will be me. My role is to check in with you for at least 20 minutes. If we need more time, that’s totally fine. During that time, the goal is to check in with each other. I'll be asking you about the messages to get your input on what is making a difference—whether some are motivating you to do things, or they’re just nice but not really changing anything. The other part is goal setting. We want to work with you to get your thoughts on what goals you want to work on, and together we’ll make them achievable within a week. I’ll also follow up with you between sessions, usually by text or email. If any questions come up that are outside my scope, I’ll connect you to the right resources. While this is considered research, your conversations will remain confidential, and data will be de-identified. You can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. By the end of the four weeks, we hope you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, and that you feel empowered to manage your spiritual, mental, and physical health. Thank you for participating—your input will help shape whether this program can be implemented at a larger scale. Do you have questions before we get started?

09:13:10 Participant: I don’t think so, not off the top of my head.

09:13:12 Coach: Okay, I’ve talked quite a bit already. Before asking you about messages, I want to know more about you. What brings you here today? What are you hoping to get out of the sessions, and what do you want to focus on?

09:13:37 Participant:
I’m a senior nursing major. I was drawn to this program because it’s been a hectic year for me personally and academically. It’s been challenging to balance health and wellness with my studies and exams. We have a big exit exam called the HESI this Saturday, and I have to take it a second time, which is stressful since I didn’t pass the first time. My goal is to improve my mental and physical health. I’ve started taking steps with my physical health. In the past, I always prioritized eating healthy and exercising, but with school and personal stuff, I stopped. During COVID, when gyms closed, I had to figure out other activities but I didn’t enjoy them as much. I used to be a “gym rat,” going six days a week, but lately it hasn’t been a priority. I gained weight, felt worse physically, and lost the stress-relief I used to get from exercise.
When I saw this opportunity, I thought maybe it’s a sign. It’s been a rough year, and I wanted to take advantage of it to get back on track.

09:16:13 Coach:It sounds like you saw this as a sign that something needs to change. Things have been stacking up and now you’re realizing you need guidance moving forward. You mentioned being a nursing student, and that the pandemic shifted how you manage stress. Each week I’ll ask about your stress levels. On a scale of 1 to 10, what would you say this week?

09:17:24 Participant:A nine. Very stressed. The upcoming exam is the big reason—lots of anxiety about whether I’ll pass.

09:17:55 Coach: And what are you doing to manage that stress right now?

09:18:10 Participant: Earlier this semester, I was overwhelmed. Clinical hours, part-time job, full-time school, and studying—I wasn’t eating well, wasn’t exercising, slept 4–5 hours, and wasn’t taking care of myself. Now that clinicals are done, I’ve had more time. I’ve been studying more, but also exercising daily—walking, running, yoga—and cooking meals instead of fast food. This structure makes me feel better. My stress went from 11/10 down to something more manageable, and I feel more prepared.

09:20:09 Coach: That’s great—you’re already setting goals and making changes. On a scale of 1 to 10, how are you doing with meeting your goals this week?

09:20:34 Participant: An eight.

09:20:43 Coach: Excellent. Our goal is to help you continue maintaining and building on this. We use SMART goals—Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-based. Let’s set one for this week. Is there something you’d like to focus on—maybe walks, cooking, or mental health?

09:22:49 Participant: I want to improve my mental health, but I don’t know how. Religion used to be part of my life, but I feel disconnected now. I used to go to Catholic school, Mass, pray, etc., but I’ve lost motivation. It feels like I only do it for my parents. I’ve had a lot of loss in my life, and I don’t feel close to religion or God anymore. Maybe that’s affecting my mental health too.

09:24:34 Coach: That’s a very human experience. Beliefs and spirituality change over time. Be gentle with yourself—it doesn’t mean you’ve lost faith, it means it’s evolving. Jesuit tradition actually encourages questioning and growth. Spirituality can take many forms: meditation, walking, even cooking. What matters is what centers and pleases you. Would you like to work on this as a goal?

09:26:26 Participant: Yes, I think it can be one of the goals.

09:26:31 Coach: Great. Let’s make it specific. Since you already enjoy walking, how about practicing mindfulness while walking—being present in the moment rather than worrying about school or past conversations?

09:27:28 Participant: I like that. For this week, when I walk or exercise, I’ll focus on being present.

09:28:03 Coach: Do you usually listen to music?

09:28:11 Participant: Yes, but I could try walking meditation if you share something.

09:28:38 Coach: Perfect. I’ll send you some resources. Let’s set the goal: mindful walking for about an hour, 2–3 times this week, in the early afternoon. Why is this important to you?

09:30:27 Participant: To help with my physical and mental health.

09:30:32 Coach: Great—it’s a two-in-one. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you?

09:31:40 Participant: A nine. I’ll definitely do it twice, maybe not three times.

09:31:57 Coach: That’s fine—flexibility is key. Do you want to set a second goal this week or just stick with this one?

09:32:27 Participant: Let’s just start with one. Especially with the exam Saturday, I don’t want to overwhelm myself.

09:32:54 Coach: Good call. We want you set up for success, not stress. Remember, if a goal ever feels like pressure, you can change it. Now, about the daily text messages—any stand out to you?

09:34:22 Participant: Yes, I liked the one about thinking of things in your day that give you peace, joy, or connection. Also today’s one about making time for 30 minutes of physical activity. And the one about seven servings of fruits and veggies—it made me reflect on variety and quantity.

09:36:33 Coach: That’s excellent. Remember that servings vary (like one apple is two servings). MyPlate can be a good guideline for balance. I’ll send you resources after this: some walking meditation audios, MyPlate info, and seasonal fruit lists.

09:38:33 Coach: It was a pleasure to meet you. Will next Thursday morning work to meet again?

09:38:46 Participant: Yes, same time works. Is it the same Zoom link?

09:38:56 Coach: Yes, I’ll send you a calendar invite.

09:39:07 Coach: Have a great rest of your day and best of luck with your exam.

09:39:16 Participant: Thank you.

09:39:20 Coach: Thanks so much, take care.

09:39:20 Participant: You too.
