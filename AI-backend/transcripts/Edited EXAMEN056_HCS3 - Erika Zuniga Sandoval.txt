09:32:24 Coach: Recently, I’ve been putting in a bunch of work into gardening.

09:32:30 Participant: Yeah, it looks really cute.

09:32:37 Coach: Well, thank you for joining me today. We have a lot to catch up on. To start, I’d like to ask: how was your week with the goals you set? I know you were going to continue meditation and also do meal prep for the week. How did it go?

09:32:59 Participant: The meditation went well. I did the meal prep that day we spoke about. However, I had a really difficult time eating the food. I’m not sure why, but I just felt “nah,” like mentally it was hard. Okay, so I did it on Monday, right? We checked in on Monday.

09:33:38 Coach: Your goal was to prepare the meals, so you prepared the meals. I’d say that was the main point of the original goal. But it’s interesting—even though you prepared the meals, there was probably something affecting your appetite. Was there a lot going on with school and work?

09:34:11 Participant: Yeah, on a stress scale of one to ten, probably close to a nine. Yeah, it’s finals week and I have a lot of projects and homework assignments.

09:34:32 Coach: That could be a response to the stress you’re feeling. Stress can affect our appetite; either we eat a lot, or we don’t. But did you find that the actual action you wanted to do—meal prep—was something you were able to do easily, or were there barriers?

09:35:02 Participant: Not really. Honestly, it was easy for me. I went to Costco, bought a few things, and then cooked. It was fine. I guess the food just wasn’t very appetizing. I tried to put in more veggies: potatoes, asparagus, mushrooms… And I made beef meatballs with a little sauce. The first two days, it was tasty, but after that, I didn’t want to eat it. It’s still sitting in my fridge, and I’ll probably have to throw it away.

09:36:11 Coach: Do you think it might be because you had the same meal every day for lunch?

09:36:22 Participant: Yeah, just for lunch. For breakfast, I switched it up and kept it varied.

09:36:30 Coach: Do you find that because your morning meals have more variety, you’re more likely to eat them?

09:36:37 Participant: Probably, yes. Some days I had oatmeal, other days fruit.

09:37:15 Coach: Maybe lunch needs more variety too. But you were able to accomplish your goal of meal prepping. What are you hoping to focus on today? Are you continuing with your current goals or starting something new?

09:37:27 Participant: I wanted to be more physically active, but I don’t have access to a shower right now—they’re remodeling my bathroom. If I work out, I’d need to shower immediately. I’ve planned ahead, but it’s not possible this week. So I’ll stick to meditating.

09:38:21 Coach: You’re doing meditation 10 minutes, three times a week. Do you want to continue that?

09:38:27 Participant: Yes, because this week is going to be really busy, so I want to be realistic.

09:38:46 Coach: How confident are you that you can continue meditating three times this week?

09:38:53 Participant: Pretty confident. I plan to do it today, tomorrow, and Thursday—either in the morning or before bed.

09:39:33 Coach: That’s great; you’ve been consistent since week one. Is there anything else you want to work on this week?

09:39:56 Participant: I want to drink more water. Meal prep will be hard with my schedule and laundry. I aim to drink a gallon, but it’s tough because of the bathroom situation—I have to pour water in the toilet to flush, which makes it inconvenient.

09:41:01 Coach: How much water are you drinking now?

09:41:11 Participant: About three water bottles, roughly 16 ounces each.

09:41:28 Coach: That’s 48 ounces. Do you want to add one more?

09:41:39 Participant: Yes, that would be 64 ounces—almost half a gallon.

09:42:23 Coach: You plan to do this Tuesday through Friday, right?

09:42:49 Participant: Yes, throughout the day.

09:43:05 Coach: How confident are you in drinking four 16-ounce bottles for four days this week?

09:43:14 Participant: Probably confident. It’s getting warmer, so this will help me stay hydrated.

09:43:37 Coach: Anything else for this week?

09:43:43 Participant: No, meditation and water intake are my main focuses.

09:44:01 Coach: Let’s talk about messages you received last week. Did any stand out or motivate you?

09:44:17 Participant: Honestly, the weekend was tough due to my vaccine. The one that stood out was the bingo message—cute, though not realistic for me that weekend. I liked it and thought about keeping it as a reference.

09:44:59 Coach: How are you feeling now regarding your vaccine side effects?

09:45:07 Participant: Better. I just found out minutes before the meeting that a student I was around tested positive. It worried me because of potential exposure, but I’ll get tested tomorrow. My partner works at Stanford and will be tested today.

09:46:30 Coach: It adds stress, but you’ve been vaccinated and are taking precautions.

09:48:01 Participant: Yes, I plan to test and inform others for peace of mind. I’d appreciate some positive messages or affirmations this week—they help me on tough days.

09:52:09 Coach: Sure, I’ll include that. When will you graduate?

09:52:13 Participant: June—this is my last class for spring.

09:52:25 Coach: Is it okay to meet again on Monday?

09:52:46 Participant: Sounds good. I’ll coordinate after my 10 AM session with a student.
