17:30:30 Coach: Hello.

17:30:32 Participant: Hi. Can you hear me fine?

17:30:36 Coach: Yeah, I hear you. So let me just turn on my video. I have a lot of sounds in the back, just so you know.

17:30:48 Participant: Hi, nice to meet you, too.

17:30:56 Coach: Oh, don't worry about it. I was outside gardening. Look at my house. I was like, guys, real quick, I'm starting my new garden since it's that time today.

17:31:12 Participant: We started a little bit after the pandemic. We decided to start a little garden. But we're finding that the bugs eat everything. So we started some plants indoors, moved them up there, and hoped they survive. Mm hmm. Yeah, same. My mom—actually, I live with my parents. And we tried to do composting. We kept putting veggies and fruit scraps in a little bowl and then just put it in the garden because everything dried out. I'm going to start over today. And today I was like, there's a bunch of plants of something—I don't know what the seeds are. I don't know if it's cucumber or zucchini—but I was taking them out and I'm going to start over. So I was going to read about it. And I was like, there's a lot—a lot. I was like, we're going to have the juice forever.

17:32:08 Coach: Oh, yeah.

17:32:09 Participant: Awesome.

17:32:10 Coach: Well, thank you so much for being able to join me today. I know you have a lot going on. I know you mentioned you also have class today.

17:32:22 Participant: Yes, it was a long class, but I was like, thank goodness. I needed to go outside real quick because it was stressful.

17:32:33 Coach: My name is [Coach Name], and I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks. I want to give you a quick introduction and overview of the program itself, and then we can transition into goal setting, which is a part of the program.

17:32:50 Participant: Yeah.

17:32:51 Coach: Sounds good. So first, as you might have noticed, this is a two-part intervention. We have the daily text messages that you're receiving. Thank you for responding to them; it's really helpful for us to know what you think. The second part of that intervention is the health coaching—meeting with me once a week.  20 minutes minimum. If we need more time, we can be flexible, but at least 20 minutes so we can discuss goal setting. We can talk about the text messages themselves, see if anything stood out to you, and also stress. We definitely want to ask you about stress and how you're feeling week to week. Between each week, I'll follow up with you about your goals and how things are going, just to see your progress throughout. If any questions come up that might be outside my scope of expertise, I will do my best to give you appropriate resources. As you notice, this is a research study. We are collecting data; however, any specific conversations will be kept confidential, and the data we gather will be aggregated. You're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. By the end of the four weeks, we hope that you gain skills around problem-solving and goal-setting as a way to empower you to manage your physical health, mental well-being, and spiritual well-being. Thank you for choosing to participate. We know it can be quite a commitment—asking for four weeks of your life. Your participation will help us determine whether this type of program can benefit others. Do you have questions before we get started?

17:35:07 Participant: So are you part of a program with USF?

17:35:11 Coach: I am a Master of Public Health student at USF. I'm in my second year. This is part of my fieldwork assignment. I work with Dr. Kelly L'Engle to develop the health coaching aspect of this intervention, and I also help with the development of the text messages. So putting together what messages you wanted to send.

17:35:43 Participant: Cool.

17:35:46 Coach: So you want to know about…

17:35:51 Participant: What was that, and you want me to share a little bit about me?

17:36:06 Coach: Yes. Did you have any questions before we get started?

17:36:06 Participant: No, not really. I think my only question was in what capacity you're affiliated with USF, but that makes sense now. Yes, I'm a student. I'm also a graduate student at USF. I'm wrapping up my master's program for school psychology counseling, and I'm doing dual credentialing to be a therapist in the future. What drew me to this was that it was in particular for Latinas, so I thought, okay, let's check this out. It’s probably going to be run by Latinas, so I dig that. I come from a very big family—eight—all my family is from Mexico. Do you hear that music?

17:36:54 Coach: Okay, it's really loud.

17:36:58 Participant: It's just… okay, I’ll focus.I grew up, my parents are from Mexico. I’m the youngest. All my siblings were born in Mexico. We have been eating traditional Mexican foods. I’ve always been self-conscious about my body because growing up I was on the bigger side compared to them. I’ve always tried to be mindful of what I eat because diabetes runs in my family. Even when I lost significant weight in a healthy way, I was still sick. Through my personal mental health journey, I’m learning to love my body and respect it. I also want to continue making healthy decisions. During COVID, I felt a lot of depression and anxiety. I turned to binge eating. I carry a lot of guilt because of it. One of my biggest goals in joining this program was to get reminders to be mindful of my spirituality, mental health, and what I consume. I want to keep my body moving because I work from home half the time. I have an internship, part-time work, tutoring, and school. I’m stressed out. Sometimes I want to work out or do Zumba or lift weights, but I’m exhausted and get in my head about it. It was nice to see your text that said to dance with family or go for a walk. I realized I don’t have to do a whole workout; I can just go for a walk. That’s a little about me.

17:39:24 Coach: Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. You brought up stress. For this last week, what would you say was your stress level on a scale of 1 (not stressed) to 10 (very stressed)?

17:39:50 Participant: I want to say a nine. This was the first week I went on campus for my job. It was overwhelming. There were a lot of moving pieces. Something in my personal life triggered me a bit. I would say it was a nine.

17:40:21 Coach: Every week, I’ll ask about that to record progress.You also mentioned goals you’ve set before. How are you doing on meeting those health goals on a scale of 1 to 10? When it comes to eating, I’ve been mindful of eating more veggies and fruits, not as much processed food. I’ve tried to be mindful of portions when eating traditional Mexican foods, which tend to have more oil. Some weeks I feel pretty okay, other weeks I don’t. Stress makes it hard to keep up. I turn to comfort foods when stressed or don’t eat enough, and snack a lot, not healthy snacks. It’s stress-related—kind of an in-between.

17:41:59 Coach: That gives us a baseline. You also mentioned you want to focus on moving more, especially during the pandemic. Great. For goal setting, we can look at areas like nutrition, physical activity, and mental health. We can also focus on strategies to manage stress.

17:42:27 Participant: That sounds good.

17:42:29 Coach: To start, what would you like your main focus to be for this week?

17:42:34 Participant: I think my focus should be on moving more. I want to get back to some physical activity.

17:42:41 Coach: Perfect. Let’s set a goal. What’s realistic for you this week?

17:42:46 Participant: Maybe walking 20 minutes a day for at least three days this week.

17:42:54 Coach: Great. How will you make sure you stick to that?

17:42:58 Participant: I can put it in my calendar and set reminders on my phone.

17:43:05 Coach: Excellent. That’s a good strategy. Any challenges you anticipate?

17:43:10 Participant: Just feeling too tired after work or school. Sometimes I procrastinate.

17:43:17 Coach: Okay, so we can build in a plan to overcome that. Maybe shorter walks on busier days or walking at a time when you have more energy.

17:43:27 Participant: Yes, that sounds doable.

17:43:29 Coach: For nutrition, any goals this week?

17:43:33 Participant: I want to make sure I include vegetables with at least two meals each day.

17:43:39 Coach: Great. How about mental health or stress management?

17:43:44 Participant: I want to practice mindfulness or deep breathing at least once a day, especially during stressful moments.

17:43:52 Coach: Perfect. So for this week, we have three main goals: walking three times, including vegetables in two meals a day, and practicing mindfulness once daily.

17:44:05 Participant: Yes, that’s right.

17:44:08 Coach: I’ll check in with you through text to see how these goals are going. We can adjust as needed.

17:44:15 Participant: Sounds good. I like having that accountability.

17:44:18 Coach: Do you feel these goals are realistic and achievable?

17:44:23 Participant: Yes, I think so. They are manageable.

17:44:27 Coach: Perfect. Any other thoughts or things you want to discuss today?

17:44:32 Participant: Not really, I think we covered my main areas.

17:44:36 Coach: Excellent. Then we’ll keep these goals for the week and review progress next session.

17:44:42 Participant: Thank you.

17:44:44 Coach: You’re welcome. Thank you for sharing and being open today.

17:44:50 Participant: No problem. I’m looking forward to next week.

17:44:53 Coach: Great. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

17:44:56 Participant: You too. Bye!

17:44:58 Coach: Bye!
