12:03:27 Coach: Good, how's it going for you today?

12:03:41 Participant: Fine.

12:04:07 Coach: Yeah. Well I'm glad that we do need, and as you know today is also our last session of the program itself. Towards the end of today, I'll give you more information about next steps and follow up. However, until we get to that point, I do want to review the progress of the week and how your goals went. How did it go for this last week?

12:04:48 Participant: It was like I was actually able to do more than I wanted to do with the recipes. I think ever since we did that first goal of the water, it's kind of been building along the way and that kind of helped me. In a way, because I, you know, kind of like I like water all the time. This past week I was asking people to like that day, right now one recipe. That's all I had time for, but I had time to write that one right now and then I just sent my boyfriend to buy it online. I know that I cannot do it today, I can always do Wednesday, but then I was like, kind of in my head, what is this? So I just kind of sent him the five things and I was able to cook. And then over the weekend I actually did a longer list, and then went to go buy groceries on Sunday for this week. So I kind of started cooking more like yesterday's and it feels nice to get those instead of being company in the microwave.

12:06:22 Coach: Yeah, no of course. I mean I always want to know about your progress and sort of how you feel that you're doing on like a scale of one to 10, but I mean it sounds like you're doing really great.

12:06:35 Participant: I mean it was... I think I told you like over the other days, actually, like, you know, complete your goals, whether it's eating healthy or drinking some water. Other people don't see everything on a daily basis, but I think because of all the stress, you know, sometimes I could forget. And honestly I didn't really forget about the goal, but one thing that I realized is even not only just like talking to clients, but like talking to myself, I actually like every time we come up with a goal like you're very, very... you want to be very specific and like that has made me feel more specific. Like when I want to do this or I want to do that, I even ask myself, what's back pain like? How to get, you know, twice a week is good or maybe even one? Like something that's doable, but kind of just that's just like something that I noticed this week is more like specific. Like okay I'm gonna do this, like okay, how many times or what am I gonna do or how to do it? All these questions that you've been asking me every time it comes to goals, and that's really hopeful.

12:08:04 Coach: That is so good. No, that's great and I mean that's really the goal to get you to think of the specifics. And I mean today will be our last day, but I'll send you a little handout about SMART planning or more SMART goal planning, which can help you if you sort of put it... if you're able to print it or just have it somewhere where you can see it from time to time. I think it will be a great reminder of those questions that we need to ask ourselves when we're setting some kind of plan or goal. You brought up a little bit about how at times when there's like a certain level of stress, you might forget to do things for example. So this week, what would you say was your stress level on a scale of one to 10?

12:08:59 Participant: I think maybe like eight and a half. There's a lot going on, especially with the end of semester, right. Yeah, I think it really just work maybe, you know, you're happy... presentation for me and it just kind of makes me a little more stressed.

12:09:23 Coach: And what are you hoping to check in about today, or what would you like to focus on for this week?

12:09:38 Participant: I kind of, like, I reflect back on the need around like myself, that a little bit... time and kind of like waking up early and kind of, I don't care of myself, but I think this week I really want to address some things that I kind of define like for me. And I came and I thought of it because of the picture that was sent like a week ago of self care and self care Bingo.

12:10:27 Coach: Yeah, and the little graphic actually has some ideas and things that you can do if you need any inspiration. Some of them are very like simple things but they can make quite a difference, like drinking tea or taking a bath, which were some of the examples we included. So in ensuring that you're able to achieve your goal and making it specific, do you have a specific activity in mind that you want to do this week to practice self care?

12:11:05 Participant: Um, yeah, I was gonna say like a bath. Like do like do that, like once.

12:11:17 Coach: You know what day of the week and what time?

12:11:24 Participant: Friday.

12:11:27 Coach: How long do you think you want to dedicate to that?

12:11:33 Participant: An hour.

12:11:36 Participant: I think if I thought about it more days, like, I think, like, health care, that when there's more time to...

12:11:57 Coach: I see. And how confident do you feel about being able to do that?

12:12:06 Participant: 7.

12:12:06 Coach: Any other goals that you want to set for this upcoming week, or continue with anything from the previous week? I know you had been working on waking up early, the new recipes, making a grocery list.

12:12:38 Participant: You know, but I'd like... Yeah, so I think I've been like wanting to do like healthy smoothies. Oh, that's something that I think that could also help, like, you know, including the water of course, but then sometimes when I feel like drinking like a soda or something super sugary, then I can just do a healthy smoothie or something.

12:13:00 Coach: So are you thinking... So you mentioned you want to continue with the water, and we could add that. But then in addition to that you're thinking of having a healthy smoothie?

12:13:16 Participant: Say that again?

12:13:17 Coach: So you mentioned that you want to continue with the water intake, and I can include that as part of your goals, but you also mentioned smoothies. Is that something that you want to do, how many days of the week?

12:13:43 Participant: And it's getting more and more now, so incorporate. Are you thinking fruit smoothies?

12:13:55 Coach: Three times this week you're thinking of doing this for sort of like a practice at lunch or dinner or kind of like a snack sometime in the week, or in the day?

12:14:14 Participant: Kind of gives me energy.

12:14:20 Coach: Okay, so incorporate fruit smoothies three times this week around lunchtime. And then you mentioned you want to continue... let me just review. The water - so for water you are doing three bottles of 16 ounces, and you are doing that for four days of the week. Do you want to continue doing that four days of the week?

12:14:52 Participant: Okay, four days. Yeah.

12:14:52 Coach: And you want to continue with three water bottles correct?

12:14:59 Participant: And then you said five days of the week.

12:15:04 Coach: And how confident do you feel about being able to continue with the water intake? And let me ask you about the fruit smoothies, how confident do you feel about being able to incorporate that three times this week?

12:15:23 Participant: Eight.

12:15:29 Coach: It's a strong confidence level, that's good. Any other successes that you have this week or challenges that you want to problem solve around for today?

12:15:46 Participant: Um, I think, probably... anything that comes to mind right now.

12:15:56 Coach: I mean we said, I included three goals - I included the self care, the water and the smoothies, and I can send you a summary of all those just so you have those in writing. I guess also in thinking of today as being our last session, I want to get an idea of how you will maintain your health and wellness goals moving forward. Do you have ideas on how you want to do that?

12:16:27 Participant: More like writing. Like, I think getting a journal and writing down everything that I need to do throughout the day and I use it. I use my computer and then my phone and this is like very helpful, but I think, like, accountability, or actually again I would use it as a checklist. Like every Sunday night, what I do is I kind of write down what I need to do every day, like Monday a checklist of what I need to do Monday. And then I go through it every night like okay I did this check check check check with every day, like they just keeping myself accountable. Like I would like to try to be, like, spreading it like, oh drink three bottles of water.

12:17:26 Coach: So being able to keep track can also help you to stay accountable. And again, I think that's, I mean whatever works for you, I think that will work for you and that will make things efficient. Yeah, that's great. Let's see, you know, in terms of the messages that you received this last week, I know you mentioned that the self care bingo sort of motivated you to spend or dedicate some time to self care, were there any other messages that stood out to you this week?

12:18:05 Participant: Text messages before, but it was a picture with a salad with... time with my family and like eating a meal together. I really want, and that's a big goal. And then, and I was like, okay, I was gonna ask why, why were your favorites... like with family.

12:19:06 Coach: It was absolutely not intentional but I'm glad that it worked out that way.

12:19:09 Participant: Yeah.

12:19:12 Coach: Well, I'm glad that the messages have been useful and you are going to continue to get messages. I believe you'll get them into this upcoming Sunday. That might be... they might... I think they're scheduled to end because you're only getting them for four weeks, the same period of time that you meet with me. So after those four weeks, yeah, you won't be getting messages anymore. Anything else that you want to add or want to discuss today?

12:19:50 Participant: Um, no, I think... I mean, what's all part of it I think that was probably those goals that I had in mind for this week. I think I'm holding myself accountable to like goals and be very specific on like what I can do that I don't want that energy... I don't want that energy up just so busy, but I think I've been specific to what I can do has been really helpful to me actually.

12:20:25 Coach: Okay, so being specific with what you want... And as I mentioned, I'll send you the little handout that has just a quick reminder about how to make goals specific or use the SMART goal setting method, which I think is really helpful to help you and all the future goals that you want to create for yourself whether they're around health and wellness or whether they're around anything else that you want to accomplish in your life. I think this is a really good method that helps us think through that process.

12:21:20 Participant: For sure.

12:21:23 Coach: So, to continue to focus on the water intake, maybe start including some smoothies so that you have other healthier alternatives for drinks and also dedicate some time to self care because you know that you can have some stressful times coming in. So let me know, and as I mentioned a little bit earlier, today's our final session. And as I told you, you set great goals for yourself this week, so I'll send you an email with a summary of the goals and with resources, and then that might be useful for just the SMART goal planning handout. Anything else that you can think of that might be useful, that you might need my support with for this week with resources?

12:22:15 Participant: No, I think, I mean the links that you sent me like every week along with the like the goals like that's been like helpful information. And I know the meditation ones like that you said in the beginning, we kind of talked about, like walking and doing those things like that was also very useful. I mean, just like reminders I know sometimes I don't respond but I see them like at the end of the day, like I said, it's like a super helpful reminder to reflect because, kind of like that sometimes it's so hard to actually think about like myself when it's so busy I'm just thinking about what I need to do like what I need to get done. And I never kind of reflect on things, and take like a few minutes and say, okay, how am I feeling today or like, have I done this today. So I think reminders are always like pretty healthy. Stay a little more accountable to my goals is what I need to get done. I thought that I had to have a head.

12:23:20 Coach: And last week, I added on the email, is this resource for this website called Eat Fresh, that has the recipes and just so you know that site also has recipes for smoothies. So in case that that helps you. Yeah, it has the recipes for a bunch of different things so if you need some guidance, you can also... I can add it again on week four, if you want, but the link is on the email from week three. So in terms of next steps as I mentioned earlier, you'll receive a few more text messages so feel free to continue to respond with your thoughts. You're also going to receive a link to a follow up survey through email by the end of today. The survey is similar to the previous one that you completed in order to enroll in the program. But it should be a little bit quicker, it should take maybe 15 minutes or so. After you complete the survey, you'll be invited to meet with one of my colleagues from our team, because we do want to ask you a few more questions about your experience, and we want to get your authentic feedback on how to improve the program. So this meeting is typically 40 to 60 minutes. And I wanted to ask you, what do you think? Today's Tuesday, would Tuesday work for you? Did you want to schedule that around 1pm just in case, because it will be with a different person. It won't be with me.

12:25:05 Participant: What are you thinking for next Tuesday? More every week kind of changes a little bit like they will be like a good time to say.

12:25:34 Coach:  Let me see who's available Tuesday 1pm. And then what I'll do is, in the meantime, I'll send you the survey link. And as you're completing the survey, I'll solidify the interview date and time. If for any reason someone is not available that day then I'll reach back to you so that we can schedule a different time that that works for all the parties involved.

12:25:57 Participant: Sounds good.

12:25:59 Coach: Yeah, but for now have it tentative so next Tuesday, which is the 18th, 1pm. Okay. And if your schedule changes just let us know too. It is very important that you complete the survey before we invite you to that interview. Yeah, because we want... we're not going to add you to the calendar invite until we see that you completed the survey so just FYI. And on the email I'll set a little deadline just to keep it on the back of your head. Any questions about that? Well I really want to thank you so much Jennifer for participating in our program. It's been a pleasure to work with you these last four weeks, I know that I know you work really hard to make changes in your life so remember that you're in control of some of the things in your life, and have your connection to health and wellness. So hopefully some of the skills that we discussed like the SMART goal planning can continue to help you as you set more goals for the future and achieve them. So please take care.

12:27:34 Participant: Thank you for being so flexible I know I've changed the times a couple of times and I really appreciate you being flexible.

12:27:38 Coach: We do, we can, we understand that everyone has different needs so we got to make sure we're ready for that.

12:27:47 Participant: Yeah, and I think all the questions and all, but you marked and offered, super helpful summarizing the goals and everything.

12:27:58 Coach: Yeah. I'm glad I'm glad that you found that useful too. So, best of luck with the rest of the semester. Remember to practice some self care because taking care of ourselves is important because then it allows us to better care for others as well.

12:28:17 Participant: Yeah, yeah, thank you so much.

12:28:20 Coach: Have a great day.
