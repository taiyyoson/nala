10:01:03 Coach: Good morning.

10:01:05 Participant: Good. How about you?

10:01:10 Coach: Let's see. I have been keeping my room very dark this morning so I wasn't sure it was going to be bright enough on video but I think we're okay, because it's really warm now. So I have the lights off, the curtains are closed, trying to keep the room cool. Okay, so let's get started for today. Today is our session four so it will be our last session for the program. Towards the end of today, I'll tell you a little bit more about next steps and sort of follow up that is going to be happening. But until we get to that point I want to know how was your week? How did you do with your goals of eating practice and physical activity? And I know you also wanted to spend some time outdoors. So how did it all go for you?

10:02:03 Participant: It was pretty good. I think I kept up with everything. One thing was I just wasn't as creative in terms of trying new things to eat. But, um, my mom's really been cooking so I've just been eating whatever she's making and I think she put asparagus in my pasta the other day and I thought that was delicious. So that was one different thing that I ate that included vegetables. But yeah, in terms of getting out and doing exercise, it's definitely been a lot easier. Now that the weather's nicer and I'm feeling more willing to be active.

10:02:46 Coach: That's great to hear. It, yes the weather definitely changes the mood of it. And then thinking about stress level this week, how was your stress this last week on a scale of one to 10?

10:03:04 Participant: I would say like a seven just because it is winding down in the semester and a lot of stuff. I have two presentations this week and a bunch of papers so it comes with the territory.

10:03:17 Coach: Now, I know. Yeah, it's the end of the semester. Everything needs to get done on time. And then thinking about today. So today, as I mentioned, is our session four. I still want us to think about what do you want to check in about today or what do you want to focus on. And think about your goals a little bit more long term, like for example in three to six months, what do you want to be able to accomplish. And we can still set up SMART goals that can help you to be able to achieve that. So what are you hoping to get out of today? What have been your thoughts?

10:04:00 Participant: I think for me it's just trying to maintain the consistency and wanting it to last forever. And it's hard when I'm busy throughout the day but just trying to make an effort, that's kind of my biggest thing is really trying to make an effort and not be content with doing nothing.

10:04:24 Coach: Yes, it can be easy to just not do anything. But if you remember that it will affect the way you feel, the way your body responds to things, and our mood is definitely affected a lot. So hopefully getting outdoors and doing some of the activities that you are doing have helped you be able to understand how that can also change the way that you feel and that in itself can motivate you to stay consistent and wanting to keep it up for a little longer. So are there specific goals that you want to continue to be able to do? Do you want to continue working on the previous goals that you had like the eating practice and the physical activity? I know last week you also had getting outdoors. So those, I mean those are really good ones to keep up. Or is there something that you want to change up? What were you thinking?

10:05:29 Participant: I definitely want to keep up these goals. Just because they're good goals to have. But I think, I do want to add to them as time goes. I do want to like increase the frequency and how often I do both, but I'm just yeah I really just focusing on those. And I think for me it's about building up my energy in the long term. I feel like I have very low energy throughout the day. So, and I have a new clinical training site with children on the spectrum. So that's going to require a lot of energy and I want to be able to give my all in that training site. So I definitely like long term wise I want to increase my energy level in order to, you know, really utilize my day.

10:06:22 Coach: And I would say that the goals that you set for yourself can help you achieve that. Do you feel you've seen that happen? So hopefully keeping up with those will be helpful. In terms of something, what I'll do is I'll write the goals that you had last week, and that you'll continue with those for this week. How confident do you feel about being able to achieve, like the eating practice, and physical activity and also getting outdoors?

10:07:01 Participant: I feel really confident, especially since the summer is coming so I'll definitely get outdoors more. And I've been eating breakfast every day now. I think it's like, now I'm just like I can't not eat breakfast. So, um, yeah I really do feel confident that I'll keep it up.

10:07:21 Coach: On a scale of one to 10, where would you qualify yourself for confidence?

10:07:25 Participant: Like a nine.

10:07:37 Coach: I always say anything above seven tells me that okay you've thought about it and yes this is something that you will consistently work on. If it's anything lower, then we need to do some problem solving. And thinking about the progress that you've made over the last three, four weeks. What would you say have been like your successes, or what have been some of the successes that you've had?

10:08:08 Participant: I think a major success is eating breakfast. Well really eating every meal of the day now. That hasn't, that's been an issue for me, either forgetting or just not being motivated to go find something to eat. So I've definitely been proud of myself for eating more consistently. I've had way less stomach problems. And I think that's a good thing. And then, I think exercising too. I think my shoulders, I can already see a difference because that's kind of an area I've been focusing on because I have really bad shoulders. So I already see like a difference when I see my reflection, like if I have a T shirt on they're a lot more square and look not as like narrow. So I'm just noticing the changes has definitely been a good thing.

10:09:03 Coach: And what are some of the, you mentioned this a little bit earlier with the energy level, but what are some of the challenges that you're still facing that maybe we could do some problem solving, so that when they come up, you're able to know okay this is what I can do to overcome this.

10:09:22 Participant: I think myself is probably the biggest obstacle. Like I'm very willing to say, Oh, I don't want to do something so I'm not going to do it. And I need to really break that mentality and tell myself like this is a requirement, this is a required assignment, you can't skip it. Because I do, like there'll be times where I'm just like yeah I really just don't feel like it, so I'm not going to. And then my partner will be like, no, get out there and go do at least 10 minutes and I'm like, all right, and then that will extend to the full time so I'm like okay I'm already out here. So it's really just that initial step of just doing it.

10:10:04 Coach: I would say that tends to be quite a challenge at times right, taking that first step. You've been able to find ways to do it. And it also sounds like you have support from others that can push you to do it. So it's very helpful to have support. And I think that is something that's something that can push us forward at times when we doubt ourselves or it might not even be doubt, when we prefer to just say okay, I'm not going to do this right now, but if someone gives us that motivation or that little extra push, then we might be more likely to do it. And how would you continue to track your goals moving forward, or sort of hold yourself accountable for your goals?

10:11:06 Participant: I think, I mean I don't necessarily hold myself accountable, it's really just me thinking about like my partner, when I see him over the weekend he's like how often did you work out? And I'm like, so I know like I have to, if I tell him only once he's going to be like, Wow, really, and I'm like, No. So it's just I think having somebody else hold me accountable is helpful, because I do make the excuse of like, well, I'm young, I'm healthy enough, you know I'm able to walk as far as I need to walk, I'm able to get up and go wherever I need to go, so I do make the excuse that I am capable of doing anything. I don't necessarily feel like I need to exercise but I am reminded you know, in the long term, I'm not going to always be able to do this and it's really about the future, not necessarily about right now.

10:12:00 Coach: Yes, I would say, I mean especially when we're thinking about in the realm of public health we think a lot about prevention and preventing future potential chronic conditions, or just the ability to be able to do more as we get older is really important and critical. And just as you mentioned when we are at a certain age we think well we can do it all right now. And just like you mentioned, it may not always be the case right? Because eventually, if we are very lucky, we will get to an older age, and things are going to change, our body will change. So the more that we can stay active and have those habits that are going to help us to have a long and healthy life, the better. And it really is about starting those lifestyle changes now, so that it's not so difficult later on in life.

10:12:59 Participant: Yeah, I think I definitely agree and I even like it's little things you don't start to notice until you're called out. Like I have a bad shoulder and I didn't realize I can't reach backwards with it. Like I can go like that but I can't do that with this arm. And I was like, Oh, that's kind of an issue. If I can't necessarily just reach. Anyway, and it's kind of like okay well that's like the first thing to go right now is my shoulder and everything else will start to follow. So if I let that go then everything else is going to go. So the goal now is to really make sure that the shoulder isn't a problem, and that nothing else becomes a problem, like you said.

10:13:44 Coach: Yes, and, and maybe, and I'm hoping that the exercises that you're doing are helping you to regain more like range of motion for that shoulder. Shoulders are my weakness too. I'm going to tell you a funny story as a side note, and I have like rotator cuff issues. And, yeah, and I get what is called a frozen shoulder, every so often, which to me is I have to walk around like this because it's so painful. And I can't move it, or I call it the T-rex shoulder. I've had that a few times in the last, maybe three years, I get it at least once a year. Last year actually I did not. And I was surprised.

10:14:37 Participant: Yeah that's wild. I, yeah, mine is also the rotator cuff and for me they called it stretchy tissue. So I have like, I'm prone to dislocations. I dislocated my shoulder all the time. And if I'm walking my dog, I cannot carry the leash on my left because he will pull the shoulder out. It's so, it's like, apparently that's true for everywhere in the body, so it's like I really do have to, like, yeah, this is an issue that is like bad for the long term. Short term I'm like oh it's like something little that I deal with but it's like no, that could be a big issue and so yeah you're right, definitely focusing on like the mobility stuff, like getting the bands out, knocking the dust off of them and doing those exercises.

10:15:40 Coach: Yeah. it is about in the long term how we can keep those joints healthy. Happy joints now. They keep us moving so we gotta keep them like oiled, kind of like a car right? We need them for sure. So you have goals. We talked about successes that you've had. I'm trying to think, any other thoughts that you have for today's session? I know it's our last session, any other topics that you want to bring up?

10:16:17 Participant: Oh, I think in terms of like getting the text messages. They definitely make me want to expand my taste palette because like when I saw the spinach and strawberries, I was like, I hate both of those. I was just like wow I like, I don't give any food a chance and I'm just like, over it. So I think for me, it really is getting me to want to try new things like whether or not I like strawberries, I want to go try some, like strawberry situation, and whether or not I like spinach I want to try to incorporate that some way somehow because how can so many people in this world eat this food and I refuse to like it. So I do want to, you know, expand my palate as much as I can.

10:16:59 Coach: Okay so, so you mentioned actually just as I think I was checking to see what messages you received this week and I saw that one. So it just made me think about it in a way that this is just an idea right, spinach and strawberries, but maybe there's another fruit and another like leafy green that you enjoy. But just, it's also meant to give you, like you said, ideas of what other things you could try potentially. Sorry we didn't hit the mark with this spinach situation.

10:17:32 Participant: That's okay, I think, for me it's like the strawberries have been like a childhood trauma situation and I think it's just about me moving past it and seeing is it really I don't like them or is it because I was traumatized with these things. So it's, it's very interesting to me. I just don't know what happened with the strawberries.

10:17:55 Coach: If you don't mind me asking, what happened with the strawberries?

10:18:02 Participant: I was, I don't even know if this is an accurate memory, because I was so young, I was like, maybe five. I was babysat by an older woman and I just remembered her being such a terrible lady and she had created a, like a strawberry snack for everybody and I was like oh I don't want strawberries I don't like them, and she forced them down my throat and I was just like, I think from there I never ate strawberries ever again I was like I'm over it. So I think for me that has like unconsciously been the reason, and I've just stuck with the story of I don't eat strawberries. And now I think it's like I, I mean I make chocolate dipped strawberries for my family all the time. Maybe I should eat one, and just give it a try.

10:18:42 Coach: I was going to ask, well how about if they're covered in chocolate? Like really covered like a nice thick layer? I mean, but sometimes those memories. And that's one of the wonderful things that I talk sometimes about with food. Foods bring up memories, whether there might be good, or whether they might not be so good right. So how do we, how do we still enjoy the foods that are going to give us like good nutrition, like good values that we need, or like vitamins and minerals that we need to consume, but still have some of those like good memories that we want to have. Or, yeah.

10:19:25 Participant: That's a tough one. Interesting. Now I wish I did my dissertation on like food and emotions or food and memory.

10:19:33 Coach: I mean sometimes when I'm eating something or tasting something and they will take me back to when I was a kid and having XYZ. Right. Maybe we should have had the food and memory conversation. How is the dissertation going?

10:19:56 Participant: That's going slowly but it's going.

10:20:02 Coach: Any other messages that stood out to you this week, or was that the main one?

10:20:15 Participant: I think that one, just because it like I was just like, yeah, you're right, you and everybody else I need to eat more vegetables. It's just these messages are always like speaking to things that I'm always like, Yes, you're right. I know I need to do that.

10:20:27 Coach: And our hope is that as you're thinking about it then when we do our goal setting. Then you can set goals around it so for example right now you're doing breakfast, maybe just adding fruit or a vegetable to your breakfast. And that's those are ways that we could add that on to what you're already doing. We covered everything. Let me give you just a few more details about what comes next. Because today's session four. And as I mentioned you have set great goals for yourself for this last week, I'll send you an email with a summary of what those will be. And then for next steps, you are going to continue getting a few more text messages. I believe your messages will end maybe this Sunday or so. After that, so please continue to respond to them if you have any thoughts on them. You will, by the end of today you will receive a link to do a follow up survey. I think you should be able to get that today. The survey is similar to the one that you did at the very beginning of the program. However, it should be a little bit shorter and it should not take more than 15 minutes. After you complete the survey, you're going to be invited to meet with one of my EXAMEN colleagues, because they want to do like a follow up meeting to get your feedback, to hear more about your experience during the program to get your feedback on how to improve the program. This meeting is typically a little bit longer, maybe 40 to 60 minutes. As of now, we've been trying to schedule them around the same time when you and I meet. But I think I was asked because interviewers have a bit of a conflict with this time I think they wanted to know if you could meet on the 20th at this time at 10am. Or we could do next Thursday, but it would have to be maybe 11, and later.

10:22:46 Participant: Okay. I think I could do either time. My only thing is I have class at 12:45. Oh wait, I don't think I'll have class, right because classes end after this week or next week, no after next week. So I'll be available.

10:23:05 Coach: So you could do next week, next Thursday, you think the 13th or the 20th? I'm just thinking maybe do it sooner rather than later so that it's fresh in your mind.

10:23:19 Participant: Okay, I do have an appointment on the 13th at 11:15. I don't know if you could do 10, or if the 20th would be better.

10:23:33 Coach: We could do the 20th and I think that seems to be the best. Okay, so let's keep the same time. Right. At 10am, okay. But 10 works. Yeah. Okay, so that I would also give you a little bit more time to complete the survey, because ideally you want to complete the survey, the follow up survey before your meeting. I'm going to put on the survey email a deadline for it, it won't be before the 20th. But just as soon as you get it then, the sooner the better because then you don't have to think about it. So I'll send, so you will get the calendar invite until you complete the survey so that's something to keep in mind. So you'll get the survey, complete that and then we'll add you to the calendar invite but I'll put a hold for that date and time for now on our calendar and invite the person that can do the interview. Any questions about that? Well thank you so much for participating in EXAMEN. It's been a pleasure working with you these last four weeks. You worked really hard to make lots of positive changes with your physical activity and eating breakfast every morning. So remember that you are in control of certain things in your life, right. And it's important to just stay active and moving to improve our health and just overall wellness as we move forward. I know it's also the end of the semester so having some time for yourself and hopefully these practices can help you stay like centered and clear when you have other stressors that are going on. And hopefully it's helped you to gain some skills that you can continue to use moving forward in your journey to continue with your health and improving your wellness. Do you have any questions that you might have?

10:25:39 Participant: I really enjoyed this and being able to talk to you is really nice. So thank you.

10:25:48 Coach: I know, I know. I'm sad we're getting close to the end. I have no one else to talk to now. But it's been really good. At the beginning this intervention was not meant to be done during COVID, but I think it actually worked out really well because it allowed us to somehow stay in touch with others. It didn't give us that opportunity to still stay connected.
