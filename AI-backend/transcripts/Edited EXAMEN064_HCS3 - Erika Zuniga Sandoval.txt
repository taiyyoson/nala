12:15:59 Participant: Hi, how’s it going.

12:16:02 Coach: It’s going good.

12:16:03 Participant: Just so busy. I was doing another meeting with school, so yeah. It’s Wednesday. I had such a strange week this week, just glad that it was. I just think when I woke up this morning, like my Google Calendar tells me what I’m doing today, and I was like, how am I already checking in again? Like, oh my god, it’s Wednesday. I literally thought it was Monday. This week has gone so fast. I’m not even kidding—it felt like a Monday. I was like wow, this week has gone so fast. I was supposed to go drop off some items at an offsite today, make food, and I started responding, and then added lemon—supposed to do that today. I was also supposed to drop off items at 9:30 in the morning. Mm-hmm. And if this also happens to me—if I don’t put it on my calendar, it doesn’t happen. Yeah, I didn’t put it on my calendar. But yesterday, I spent most of the day arranging that, and when I woke up in the morning, I remembered.

12:17:29 Coach: Oh my goodness.

12:17:30 Participant: Okay. Everything’s in the car. I asked them if I could do it this afternoon, so I have one more meeting at one, and I’m hoping I can get it dropped off. Yeah, well, it’s so cold here. Like I’m in San Francisco, so it’s freezing. I’m used to cold weather, but this is another level of cold. I didn’t even want to leave anywhere. I was going to go to Philz, and now that everything’s open a bit more, I wanted to get a coffee. They have huge patios to work outside. Then this morning I woke up, looked out my window, and thought, nope, it’s not happening. It’s one of those comfy work-from-home days.

12:18:16 Coach: Yeah, I think the weather in San Francisco tends to be a little bit cooler, so close to the water. It reminds me a little bit of Monterey.

12:18:24 Participant: Yeah, for sure.

12:18:26 Coach: So how was your last week? How was your goal? I know you went home—your goal was to do some type of physical activity or something active with the family. How did it go?

12:18:39 Participant: Yeah, I went home and I ended up walking my dog with my sister. That was really nice. I tracked it with my Apple Watch—we did two miles. So that was nice. We were just walking to clear our minds, and then when we got back home I realized my Apple Watch was still on. We checked and it was exactly 1.98 miles, so we walked to the stop sign and back to make it an even two miles.

12:19:19 Coach: Nice, good. So what would you say on a scale of one to 10, how did you do in meeting that goal over the weekend?

12:19:25 Participant: A ten.

12:19:27 Coach: That’s good. And how was your stress level last week—say on a scale of one to 10?

12:19:39 Participant: It was like a six.

12:19:44 Coach: Okay, so you had things going on and some stress in your life, right?

12:19:49 Participant: Yeah, but surprisingly this week—because I was so stressed last week trying to get things done—I kind of got ahead. I thought, I’m going home this weekend, I won’t be able to do this or that. But on Sunday night I checked what assignments were due and realized I had already done them. So I don’t have homework this week. I could get ahead for next week, but I think I’ll just take it slow, enjoy it, and get back to my normal routine this weekend. It’s such a contrast—last week I was so stressed, and this week I’m just focused on work.

12:20:37 Coach: That’s a good feeling, to know you don’t have as many things to get done this week because you actually did some of them ahead of time. That’s good. What are you hoping to check in about today? What do you want to focus on for this week?

12:20:56 Participant: We worked on physical activity. The strength training is going so good. I feel stronger every day and it feels so good. It’s motivating me to be curious about other things. Like, now that I’m doing well with strength training, I’m excited to try yoga, which isn’t about strength in the same way. I feel more comfortable stepping out of my comfort zone. I started looking into what’s available around the SF area and I found this super cool outdoor yoga class. You do it with headphones on—it’s like music-based. It’s called Silent Disco Yoga. It’s at Ocean Beach, just five minutes from me. Everyone brings their own mat, you get sanitized headphones, and it’s open to all levels. I always knew it was there, but I was never confident enough to try. Yoga sounds easy, but it’s not—it takes balance and strength. But now I feel more confident, so I think I’m going to book a class and maybe ask a friend to come. Or maybe I’ll go alone just to see how it feels. Having a buddy might make it easier.

12:23:30 Coach: Okay, definitely. Having a buddy can make it more powerful and motivating. So are you thinking this week’s goal will be around doing yoga this weekend?

12:23:58 Participant: Well, I actually got a second job. Back in undergrad I worked at Lululemon for about a year. After I graduated and COVID happened, I stopped. But my old roommate still works there and told me they’re hiring again for the summer. They’re flexible and since I already know everything, I’d probably get hired. At first I wasn’t sure, but then I thought—it could help me save money. I’ll be living in Mexico for two months this summer, so having extra cushion money would help. I told them I could only work Fridays or Saturdays, maybe two times a month, just to keep boundaries. They agreed. So I’ll be working this weekend—Friday and Saturday. That means I probably can’t do yoga, unless maybe Sunday.

12:25:50 Coach: Okay, so maybe a different plan would be more feasible for this week. Is there another goal you want to work on instead?

12:26:09 Participant: I think my goal will be managing all the things on my plate. Even though I’m working, I still want to make time for the gym. Thankfully, my shift Friday is 12:30 to 7 pm, so I want to wake up early to get a good workout in before work. And since it’s Lululemon, I can literally just wear my gym clothes. No need to change or shower first. My goal is to stay consistent with my gym schedule even though I’ve added more responsibilities.

12:27:26 Coach: That’s a good goal. It’s important to keep up with what helps you stay active, even as you add more to your plate. So how many times do you want to go to the gym this week?

12:27:45 Participant: It’s Wednesday, so I want to go Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I’m skipping today because it’s really cold.

12:28:03 Coach: And remind me—typically how long do you go each time?

12:28:11 Participant: About an hour. I’ll do 30 minutes of cardio, then take a break, then do stretches and stuff.

12:28:17 Coach: And do you usually go morning, afternoon, or evening?

12:28:27 Participant: Usually evenings, but because of my work schedule this weekend I’ll go in the mornings.

12:28:34 Coach: And how do you usually remind yourself to go? Do you set an alarm?

12:28:34 Participant: My Apple Watch. It gives me reminders and those “ring” notifications to stay active. Sometimes even by 8 am it tells me to get moving, so I just go.

12:28:57 Coach: Okay, good. And how confident do you feel about achieving this goal—going to the gym four times this week?

12:29:19 Participant: I’d say a nine. I don’t have academic responsibilities right now, so I can focus on work and gym.

12:29:35 Coach: Great. Do you want to keep it to one goal this week, since you have quite a bit going on?

12:29:44 Participant: Yeah, I think one goal is enough.

12:29:51 Coach: I am thinking about the messages that you've received so far. Are there any messages this last week that stood out to you? Have you been able to put them into practice, or have any of them motivated you to do something new?

12:30:06 Participant: Um, I liked the one today about thinking of ways to get creative with coffee. Because I think in the past, I've always been a coffee lover—like, I’m such a big coffee person. But the way I started off with coffee was Starbucks, caramel frappuccinos. And I just knew it was so unhealthy, with all the whipped cream and caramel, but that was what I thought coffee was at that time. And then one of my friends was like, “You could get a drink that’s similar to a caramel macchiato but a little healthier.” Like substitute the milk, or add different options. I tried it, and I really liked it. Ever since then, I’ve slowly transitioned out of whole milk to almond milk, oat milk, and soy milk. My family are big dairy people, so it’s everywhere, but I’ve become more aware—like how it can be healthier to not get a frappuccino with whipped cream, but just have a good coffee with a substitute creamer. I still get my fix. So yeah, it reminded me that you can still enjoy things you like, but with a modification.

12:32:14 Coach: Yeah. And that’s really what we want—to realize that we can still enjoy the foods we like, but with a healthier spin or healthier option.

12:32:34 Participant: Or just have them in really tiny portions.

12:32:41 Coach: Exactly. Thank you for sharing that. We went back and forth about that message. So, coming back—are there any other successes you had this week, or challenges you want to problem-solve around?

12:33:04 Participant: Not any specific ones. I just feel so present with myself now. I reflect all the time, compared to a year ago during the pandemic, when everything was horrible. April 2021 was such a bleak time for me—I’d just gone through a breakup, moved back home, didn’t know how long I’d stay, and I had just graduated but couldn’t even say goodbye to friends. I used to write notes about how low my confidence was. I hated how I thought of myself then. Now I’d never tolerate people treating me that way—or me treating myself that way. I remember my therapist telling me, “A year from now, you’ll see your growth.” At the time, I thought she was lying, because I felt so horrible. But now, I can see how much progress I’ve made, and it feels surreal.It wasn’t overnight—it took work. I sought help, learned to let go of toxic relationships, even with some family. That was really difficult, but necessary. Now I’m happy with my small circle of friends, the people I trust.

12:36:57 Coach: You can see how far you’ve come. And give yourself credit—you put in the work. It didn’t happen overnight. Letting go of things, especially family, is really hard. We’re raised to think “family is always family,” but sometimes they can hurt us more than they help.

12:38:00 Participant: Yeah, I definitely agree. And I want to surround myself with people who support me and my growth.

12:38:14 Coach: Exactly. That’s what matters.

12:38:30 Participant: It was a good reflection. I realized too that I wasn’t perfect—I had toxic traits as well. I used to think, “I’m not the problem,” but I was part of the problem. Now I can acknowledge that. My stubbornness isn’t just a personality trait—it can be toxic too. I’ve learned to reflect and accept that.

12:39:28 Coach: We all play a role in our situations, and being aware of that role is important. You brought up a really good point—recognizing our own flaws and how they might contribute to problems.

12:39:55 Coach: Thank you for sharing that.

12:39:59 Participant: It makes me think of a lot. I even picked up this book at Target called The Story of My Life. It’s full of journal prompts. I’m not usually good at handwriting my thoughts, but this book makes it interesting—it asks things like “When was the moment you realized ___ in your childhood?” It’s been cool, and it makes me reflect.

12:40:50 Coach: That’s wonderful. Thank you for sharing. Any other questions for today? We’ve set some goals, and as always, I’ll send you a summary. I’m just thinking—since you have access to a gym, is there anything else I can provide, like resources around exercise or anything else you’re unsure about? For example, if someone tells me they want to increase water intake but they don’t enjoy it, I send ideas to make it fun. You already have your gym routine down, so I don’t think you need ideas there. But if anything comes up, we can brainstorm.

12:41:58 Participant: Okay, sounds good.

12:42:01 Coach: Today was session three, so we’ll have one more session next Wednesday. I’ll double-check on some May 5th sessions too—someone already asked to reschedule, so I’ll confirm with you.
