17:01:18 Coach: Hi.

17:01:18 Participant: Hi. How are you?

17:01:20 Coach: Good, how are you?

17:01:22 Participant: Good, good. How's your day going?

17:01:26 Coach: It's good. Warm. So, summer weather's coming, can you believe it? It's so early I'm like, "gosh, summer's already coming."

17:01:44 Participant: Yeah, it's pretty intense. Yeah. Overall, it's good.

17:01:54 Coach: I've been having a little bit of internet troubles so please let me know if something happens. I can turn off my video and then we can have better connection.

17:02:10 Coach: But where do you want to start today?

17:02:15 Participant: With my health goals. I went Friday and Saturday and then I went yesterday. So I actually went three times.

17:02:26 Coach: Cool. So you exceeded your health goals?

17:02:29 Participant: Yes. So that was good. Overall it's been a good week. I got all my work done. It was a productive week.

17:02:43 Participant: Yeah, so I have nothing to complain about.

17:02:49 Coach: This is good. Yeah, that kind of leads into like the stress question. On a scale of one to 10, how has your stress been like this week?

17:02:59 Participant: Oh, like a two.

17:03:03 Coach: Wow. Yeah, I've been ahead of everything which is nice. And I had that accomplishment of going like Friday and Saturday for my health goals. Sunday, Monday I was off and then yesterday I was like "okay I'm going to go," even though it's not part of my goal to go. I had the time and I wanted to go.

17:03:28 Coach: You exceeded your goal. Do you want to talk a little bit about like how you felt afterwards, like after going to the gym or like what have been like the positive outcomes of meeting your health goals or doing your health goal, I should say?

17:03:46 Participant: I mean, it does really feel good. I mean, when I go I always feel like really great afterwards. I feel like if I go early in the day it gives me energy throughout the day where I won't need that like coffee pick-me-up. And then when I go at the end of the day, it kind of just like feels good to just end the day on a good note, take a good like hot shower and then just go to sleep. So, both options are really good. And then I feel that having these goals have just helped me prioritize my days and my workload, because I've been like in the back of my mind like "okay I'm going to check in with Jasmine." I don't want to be like "yeah, so..." it like forces me to actually like be held accountable for accomplishing them, which forces me to like not slack on anything else.

17:04:48 Coach: Well, so much can be done when like, just like a shift in perspective happens. So I feel like you've made progress from like week one to now, but like week one I was just lost and I'm like "I don't know what to do, like I want to be that person that works out at five in the morning" but that's just not realistic. But it feels good to at least get something done. Yeah. So, I think something that really stands out about what you're saying is like you feel like you've made good progress, and... what do you think that is?

17:05:32 Participant: I think it goes hand in hand with like the daily messages like the reminders, as well as having to check in with somebody, so it's not just myself that I'm doing it for. I mean it's kind of like you have that person that eventually you have to report to at the end of the week and it feels crappy to be like "I didn't do it" versus like you just knowing you didn't do it. And, yeah, noticing the differences. I mean when we first started I was struggling with like sleeping, I had like low energy, my stress levels were high, so now it feels good that all that is improving. So it's motivating me to continue.

17:06:25 Coach: I say yes to everything you've shared and I also wonder like... I remember when we first met you had mentioned like "I want to wake up at 5am and do everything." And then this kind of like made it more like obtainable, like your goals more obtainable.

17:06:50 Participant: And so it was just not realistic. I mean, not right now. I feel like I had to wake up earlier in order to get everything done but it was really that I was just not prioritizing my tasks and I was kind of just winging it day by day. But now having it like "okay these days I have to do this," that means on the other days I have to do this, so it just helps me with time management better versus thinking I had to make more time in my schedule when I already had it.

17:07:24 Coach: I'm so... on top of that, we were able to do like short term goals that help you meet your long term goal. Because it's not just like, "okay, day one," and you do everything, it's...

17:07:45 Participant: Exactly. Yeah, aiming for like the moon when I just needed to do something small, in order to see and have that motivation like "okay let's keep going" versus getting discouraged like "crap I didn't meet it today."

17:08:10 Coach: Yeah, well I think you've been doing really great. You're kicking ass honestly.

17:08:13 Participant: Feels good.

17:08:13 Coach: So let me circle back and ask you about the text messages because you did mention how like the text messages have like helped you make this progress. What messages stood out this week?

17:08:50 Participant: It reminded me to eat my veggies. I had some today for lunch, gonna have some for dinner. And then one other one was "do something fun on Saturday." That was a good one. Sunday I had a girls day with my best friends. And we went out to eat and just had like a good time. Like this week was more on like self care and doing things I think outside of like what my health goals necessarily are, but it also was important to like remember that stuff - to spend time with people, to do something for yourself, something fun, eat good. Because I mean, yeah, going to the gym and all that's great but if you're eating McDonald's afterwards, you're not going to feel that good. So, yeah, it was nice. This week's messages were good. All of them.

17:10:08 Coach: Cool. I like that you had your girls day, those are nice.

17:10:11 Participant: Yes, very much needed.

17:10:17 Coach: So, in terms of like your health goals for this week, where do you want to go?

17:10:27 Participant: For sure, I'm going to go Friday, I'm going to try to go tomorrow and Monday. I'm going to aim for three this week.

17:10:52 Coach: And then, last time I think we did it for 45 minutes. Do you want to do it for 45 minutes, three times?

17:11:01 Participant: Yeah, let's do that.

17:11:32 Coach: Is there anything that you need, like... have you blocked it off on your calendar? Do you need to put a calendar reminder?

17:11:41 Participant: No, I mean those are just the days that work with my work schedule right now. So like Monday I'm off, Friday I'm not working till the evening so I'm going to go in the morning, and then tomorrow I'm going to go after class at night. Because I'm gone for the weekend so Saturday and Sunday, I will be out of town so I'm not even going to count on those days. So it's realistic. Like those are days that I'm like "okay these are guaranteed days for me." And then if I can add like a Tuesday, or next Wednesday, then I will, but three for sure this week for 45 minutes.

17:12:29 Coach: So, I guess for like the relevance piece, I know you mentioned some stuff before but would you want to add anything to as to why this is important to you?

17:12:45 Participant: I think it's just to keep that motivation and just that like weekly... I guess accountability to do something at least half of the week or the majority of the days, so just to stay in that rhythm of like doing something every week and not having too many days where I get discouraged to not do anything. Just kind of like... I just have to stay in the rhythm of it until it just becomes I guess second nature where I don't need so much like setting blocks in my schedule for it, it just kind of goes hand in hand.

17:13:24 Coach: Yeah, so make that behavior change, turn it more into like a habit versus a to-do list item. So just having healthy habits.

17:13:37 Participant: Exactly.

17:15:07 Coach: Sorry I got disconnected. I didn't hear what your confidence level was.

17:15:11 Participant: Nine.

17:15:15 Coach: Okay, what's preventing a 10?

17:15:37 Participant: I feel like 10 is just like... I don't know. I mean it could be a 10. Maybe Monday I might be tired from this weekend trip, so even though I have the day off I might spend that day like doing laundry and all that. So just depending... It's more like Monday I might have to switch it to Tuesday. But I do have Monday off right now so I really want to fit it in that day.

17:16:02 Coach: I think that makes sense. It's not about the availability or your commitment or any of that, it's just more like sometimes you don't quite know how the week is going to play out. So, I know you're gonna do at least...

17:16:29 Participant: Three days.

17:16:42 Coach: Yeah I feel like the internet connectivity is making everything really awkward so I apologize.

17:16:55 Participant: It's okay. Mine's like pretty unstable too. I hate it. But thanks for working with me.

17:17:11 Coach: So, was there anything else that you wanted to work towards this week?

17:17:18 Participant: No, just that one goal. Because I feel like when I do that one, all the other ones will kind of fall into place.

17:17:39 Coach: That makes sense. So I'm wondering, for the intervention like we are hoping that you're gaining skills around like goal planning in general, do you feel like you're gaining that skill?

17:18:01 Participant: Yeah, I feel that... setting realistic goals, versus going like, maybe where I want to be in the future, doing little baby steps that will get me there. And normally I just go for like the end goal, like, "Okay, this is it." So, teaching me to set realistic goals, and then later once those become more like habits I can increase it to something a little bit more intense versus just going full blown lifestyle change. You know what I mean? Like going black and white... like okay, doing little baby steps.

17:18:55 Coach: Cool. And then, I don't know if you knew but we have one last health coaching session.

17:19:17 Participant: I just heard you say "we have" and then it just cut off.

17:19:21 Coach: Oh, we have one health coaching session left next week.

17:19:29 Participant: I believe so, this was the third time that we're meeting.

17:19:32 Coach: Wow, it's gone by so fast. And so, I think we're not... we're going to talk about this next time but start considering like how you want to move forward beyond the program. But, and then for scheduling purposes, do you want to meet at this time next week, on Wednesday?

17:20:08 Participant: Yeah, that should work. It's five...

17:20:11 Coach: Yeah. Oh it's Cinco de Mayo, maybe something to consider. I could also meet earlier in the day if that works for you.

17:20:29 Participant: Yeah, unfortunately, I can either meet like really early in the morning like 8am, or I can meet after 5pm.

17:20:42 Coach: Okay, because of your job?

17:20:45 Participant: Yeah.

17:20:51 Coach: I think the evening should work. Unless you want to do 8 in the morning, I'm open to that too. If you want to do a morning one, you know, what works better with your schedule?

17:21:15 Participant: Probably... They're equal honestly, because I start work in the morning but I work from home so I mean I'd already be on my laptop. It's really up to you. And I get off at four so...

17:21:32 Coach: I'll go ahead and put us down for five o'clock and if I can get off work early that day, I'll message you... I'll text you and say we can meet earlier.

17:21:42 Participant: Okay. Does that work?

17:21:44 Coach: Yep. Okay, cool. And I'll send you a Google calendar invite tonight. Any questions before we sign off?

17:21:55 Participant: No, I think we've got it.
