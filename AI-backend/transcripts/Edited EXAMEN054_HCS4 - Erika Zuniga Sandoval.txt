09:00:17 Coach: Good morning.

09:00:20 Participant: Good morning. How are you today. I'm doing good. Okay, I'm just getting my AirPods is still kind of connecting okay there, I think this tends to be a delay right sometimes.

09:00:37 Coach: Yeah. No worries. It's been cold.

09:00:48 Participant: And just last week it was pretty cold and even at the beginning of the week goes kind of chilly. Since yesterday I felt that it was warmer. I'm hoping that was just yesterday because there's a lot of fog today. 

09:01:08 Coach: I mentioned I haven't been outside yet so I don't know if there's like a breeze of any kind, but it feels warm. Well, today's our last session. Towards the end of the day, or toward the end of the session. I'll tell you a little bit more about next steps and sort of the closing of the program itself.

09:01:50 Participant: My week was pretty good. It was very busy, like unexpectedly busy I don't let a lot of little things this week, things I'd like signed up to do that I like have realized would take so much time other other little things. So pretty busy, but I did, I did my two days of walking, because I'm always happy to do those ones I always feel like accomplished when I find time to do them. And I do enjoy them I love walking. And then, I, I only did one night of the meditation. It was nice, but I don't like, like I got very sleepy and I don't like falling asleep with like headphones in and. So I would have to get myself up again.

09:02:50 Coach: On that scale of one to attempt to measure progress, how did how would you say that you did in meeting your goals for last week. And each one individually or overall overall

09:03:04 Participant: Probably seven.

09:03:07 Coach: Because you did really well with one the other one you got a good start on.It's, it's moving. It's like it's moving in the right direction.  And you mentioned that there were a lot of things that you didn't realize were going to take a lot of time. Did you find that it affected your stress level or how was your stress level this last week

09:03:34 Participant: Was a little higher maybe like five or six. 

09:03:40 Coach: See, it happens when we tend to have a lot of, lot of things that come up. 

09:03:46 Participant: Yeah, things don't turn out the way that we expected them to.

09:03:52 Coach: Were you able to find some time so to process everything else that you needed to do.

09:04:01 Participant: Yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm a, you know, as you know I'm a planner so I was like kind of like weaving in and crossing things off as I, as I went along, but I did have to like make that extra effort to get things done on time. Oh, I think it was to reach out to a friend, which I did do. Yeah, I didn't end up having time to call them. But I did text them so

09:04:40 Coach: That's a way to reach out.

09:04:44 Participant: I was also waking up in the mornings like a little congested. I don't know maybe it's it is a change of temperature and all that. I started taking Claritin, my allergy was like the warm days were just too much.

09:05:02 Coach: So in thinking of today's session, I want us to think a little bit about what are going to be some of the skills that you're going to take, moving forward to help you in continuing to keep the changes that you've made or make additional changes in the future. But I also want us to think about, like what are some things that of course you want to check in about today. And sort of what are, the focus that you want to have like moving forward. What are some things that you want to focus on today, we can still make a local or several goals, up to you.

09:05:52 Participant: So, I think, forward. And what I most want to work on is coping with stress. I've been like walking and like being mindful when I am going on those walks and also just setting like small attainable goals, which gave me like a sense of accomplishment when I do do them. Going forward I do want to continue to set like small goals if I think of like lacking in something one week like, oh, like I've been so busy with work or with like studying or school or something like. Let me make some time to just like enjoy coffee with a friend like, and to set that as like a goal of like, I want to do that in this week at some point has like some, like kind of like a stress reliever.

09:06:52 Coach: And those are good ways to to like break down like bigger goals that you will have, because, as you mentioned it. It's not just to you know take a break and catch up with someone because at the end of the day it's going to help you manage stress for example, as you mentioned, so it has an effect on a bigger goal that you have which is stressing. So you set small goals. What else that you want to check in about today.  What do you want to focus on for this week.

09:07:41 Participant: Probably, because like this whole beginning of the semester I felt like I was so MIA, because of like school and nursing and my exam like I barely talked to like my family and I feel like I barely saw my friends I was just like, shut up, shut in and like studying the whole time. So I think my like moving forward goal I'm like my focus is just to like, enjoy my time with people, because like at the end of the day, that's like, that's like looking back like that for all remember I won't remember like all the countless hours I was like sitting, studying, you know, I'm gonna remember like the times that I've had the interactions I've had with people. So I want to focus more on like spending quality time with, like, the people I care about.

09:08:36 Coach: That makes sense. So for this week, would you like to set a goal around spending quality time with friends or family?

09:08:45 Participant: Yeah, definitely. I think maybe at least one or two meetups or calls. Just to check in with them.

09:08:55 Coach: That sounds doable. And how about the walking and meditation goals? Do you want to continue with those as well?

09:09:03 Participant: Yes, I want to keep up with the walking, at least two days, and maybe try for two nights of meditation.

09:09:12 Coach: Great. So those will be your three main goals for the upcoming week: spending quality time, walking, and meditation.

09:09:23 Participant: Exactly. I think those are realistic and manageable.

09:09:30 Coach: Perfect. Now, before we wrap up, do you want to discuss any challenges or obstacles you anticipate this week?

09:09:39 Participant: Probably just time management. Like last week, things popped up unexpectedly, so I need to make sure I schedule everything intentionally.

09:09:50 Coach: Makes sense. One strategy could be to block time in your calendar for these activities, even if they’re small blocks. That can help ensure you follow through.

09:10:03 Participant: Yes, I like that idea. I’ll try to schedule my walking and meditation, and maybe set reminders for checking in with friends.

09:10:15 Coach: Excellent. That should help. Anything else you want to check in about today?

09:10:21 Participant: No, I think that covers it. I feel good about these goals.

09:10:27 Coach: Great. Then we’ll call that our plan for this week. You’ve done a good job reflecting on your progress and identifying what’s important.

09:10:38 Participant: Thank you. I appreciate it.

09:10:42 Coach: You’re welcome. I’ll see you next week for our final session wrap-up.

09:10:49 Participant: Sounds good. I’ll be ready.

09:10:52 Coach: Awesome. And remember, you can always reach out via text if something comes up before our next session.

09:10:58 Participant: Will do. Thanks.

09:11:01 Coach: Alright. Have a great week and enjoy some time for yourself.

09:11:05 Participant: Thanks. You too.

09:11:08 Coach: Take care.

09:11:10 Participant: Bye.

09:11:12 Coach: Bye.
