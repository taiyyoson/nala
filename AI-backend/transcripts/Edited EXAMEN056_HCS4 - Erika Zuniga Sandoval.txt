11:29:00 Participant: Good morning.

11:29:02 Coach: Hello, Maria. Can you hear me fine?

11:29:02 Participant: Yes, I hear you.

11:29:24 Coach: How are you?

11:29:24 Participant: Good, just getting ready for the day. Have laundry, lots of little errands and stuff that they do.

11:29:34 Coach: But it's looking good. It's looking nice. How are things going today?

11:29:42 Participant: Things are going pretty good. I'm wrapping up my last final. I tried my best to get as much done yesterday because I was invited to a baptism. I needed to put in as much work as I could, and then I had agreed to go get a pedicure with my sister. So I woke up around 6:30, tackled the paper, then around 1:00 went to my appointment, worked a bit more, and then I was like, okay, that's enough. Today I'm going to wrap it up, but my week was pretty intense. I have so many assignments—I was on my computer all day, every day. I'm pretty tired but just want to finish already. This final paper is killing me because it's a case vignette, and the client is just so complex.I keep going back and forth about the diagnosis, but I'm just like, you know what, I'm over it. So that's what's on my mind.

11:31:01 Coach: Yeah.

11:31:02 Participant: I'm thinking maybe the client could have potentially multiple diagnoses.

11:31:05 Coach: Oh, for sure, she does. I'm glad you're able to find some time to meet today. I'll keep it as concise as possible because I know you have lots to do. Today is our last session for the program itself. Towards the end, I'll tell you more about next steps and what to look for in your email. There's one more meeting, but it won't be with me; it would be with a different person from our research team. I'll tell you more about that at the end. For now, I want to hear how your goals went for the week. I know you were going to work on drinking more water and meditation. How did it go?

11:31:59 Participant: The meditation I did two out of three days. I think it really just has to do with it being finals week—it was overwhelming. The water, I did it Wednesday and Thursday, not Friday, and it was supposed to be Tuesday too, right?

11:32:23 Coach: You were aiming for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

11:32:31 Participant: Yeah, I missed Tuesday. I did Wednesday and Thursday, struggled on Friday. It's weird, but my bathroom is still not done, so I had to move around to shower—my sister, friends. It's been a lot of moving pieces. If not for that and finals week, I think I could have done it all. Too many moving pieces.

11:33:17 Coach: Yeah, a lot came up—finals, inconsistent place to be. That can disrupt your schedule. How would you rate your stress level this week on a scale of 1 to 10?

11:33:49 Participant: I’d say seven—stressed, but I kept telling myself it’ll work out. Most people are stressed during finals week. I was just trying to get work done instead of dwelling. I also felt more comfortable asking to use others' places to shower or work. It’s week three already—they need to hurry up!

11:34:26 Coach: For your goals this week, how would you rate your progress on a scale of 1 to 10?

11:34:46 Participant: I’d say six. I went 50/50—intention was there, but too much going on.

11:35:09 Coach: Hopefully the bathroom gets settled soon.

11:35:18 Participant: It's my parents’ place. The people fixing it work full time and only come for an hour after work. My parents should’ve contracted it differently—it should have been done in a weekend. It's an old house, so they had to replace a lot. Only one person can work at a time in the tiny bathroom. I can’t be at the house much because of conflict with my mom, so I move house to house. The bathroom situation and home dynamics are difficult.

11:37:03 Coach: You mentioned family/friends are willing to let you use their space—does that help?

11:37:14 Participant: Yes, but family has younger kids, so it’s hard. I have therapy sessions too, need quiet space. I’m managing, surviving somehow.

11:37:40 Coach: We’ll find ways to survive. Resilience. What do you want to focus on today? Any things you want to continue working on?

11:38:01 Participant: I liked the little video you sent me with the heart—it was super cute. I watched it a few times. It helped me interpret a healthy meal. I have a weird relationship with food—either indulge or restrict. That video helped me feel better. It includes realistic portions, very practical.  It showed I can have meals like Mexican food but be mindful of portions. I never understood that before.

11:39:28 Coach: I had the feeling it was intended for a Latino population—it makes sense. Share it with others who might find it useful.  Thinking about the skills we reviewed, which do you think you can continue using?

11:40:29 Participant: Learned to be kind to myself, celebrate small accomplishments. Even simple goals like this week’s felt challenging, but I recognize my effort.

11:41:02 Coach: Each week is a new opportunity to reset.

11:41:29 Participant: Meal prepping was a success—even if I didn’t eat all the meals, it reminded me baby steps are okay. I’ll mix up my plates and consider portions. Planning ahead helps—like meditating, meal prepping, putting things on my calendar. If I planned ahead better, I’d have my water ready—desk, visible.

11:43:38 Coach: Agreed, those things really help. You have a good sense of where to move toward. Planning and using reminders are helpful. Being kind to yourself whenever a challenge arises is important. Every week can be a new start. Today we can set SMART goals for the next week. What goals do you want to continue or set for this week?

11:44:46 Participant: I want to keep it the same as last week—meditation and drinking more water. Same 10 minutes of meditation, three days. Same water goal.

11:45:22 Coach: How confident are you about meditation?

11:45:33 Participant: Nine out of ten.

11:45:47 Coach: How about water?

11:45:47 Participant: Nine as well.

11:46:05 Coach: Very good goals. Any messages this week that stood out to you?

11:46:31 Participant: Something about having fun and singing—it reminded me health isn’t just dieting and exercising. Live life, enjoy simple things. I also sent you a quote about making yourself a priority—it resonated with me.

11:48:31 Coach: Important to take care of yourself while helping others. Today is the last day of your text messages. Any other questions?

11:49:24 Participant: No, thank you for your support. I learned a lot.

11:49:41 Coach: You set great goals for yourself every week. I’ll send you the SMART goal template as a reminder. Next steps: you’ll receive a post-survey link. It should take about 15 minutes. Once completed, we’ll invite you to meet with another team member for feedback. Give me at least two scheduling options—I’ll coordinate with the team member who didn’t do coaching with you.

11:52:00 Participant: Monday morning works.

11:52:22 Coach: That’s soon. How about Tuesday?

11:52:51 Participant: Wednesday at 1 PM works.

11:53:19 Coach: Perfect. I’ll send a summary email with your goals and interview schedule. Thank you for participating. This time was busy, but I hope it helped you move toward your goals. Remember self-care is important.

11:54:28 Participant: Yes.
