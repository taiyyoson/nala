18:16:17 Participant: That experience was really good. It was definitely... I was on the verge of like going and not knowing.

18:16:33 Coach: Yeah. How long were you there for?

18:16:36 Participant: Initially I was only supposed to be there for a semester, but I extended my stay to the year.

18:16:39 Coach: Oh my goodness. Tell me more. I like imagine living... where did you live, specifically in France or...?

18:16:54 Participant: No, I lived in Spain and had family that was in Germany, so I kind of just traveled. It was definitely nice. I got to go to France like about five times within like a month.

18:17:14 Coach: I don't know, my image of living in Spain doesn't quite match with my image of living in France, but I just think about what like getting baguettes every day, just like eating fresh food that I can...

18:17:40 Participant: Yeah. I think I lived on a caf√© where they had like fresh bread like every single morning and like that's what I would wake up to so it was definitely a struggle to like not get weight.

18:18:01 Coach: Wow. Well that's really awesome. I'm like, you had a good experience overall too?

18:18:08 Participant: Yes, definitely.

18:18:10 Coach: Well, thanks for joining me again today. I'm sorry about the confusion. I thought that we were meeting tomorrow, but it turns out that's with someone else so thank you for being connected. I don't know if there was an error.

18:18:27 Participant: I was confused. I was like I thought we said Wednesday, but I could be wrong and I didn't know what day it was, so I was like let me just make sure before I don't show up.

18:18:37 Coach: Yeah, no thank you. Thank you. I think my brain is... Yeah, it's the last couple weeks of the quarter and my brain is a little like... Thanks, I appreciate your understanding. But, how are you doing? How did it go this week?

18:19:02 Participant: It was good. Really, like, I don't know all four... out of all three I don't remember. Just because it is like the last bit of the semester. So, I was really trying to, like, I was a little stressed, trying to figure everything out and still trying to manage like my goals and stuff, but yeah.

18:19:31 Coach: So, on a scale of one to 10, what was your stress level this week?

18:19:44 Participant: Like a nine.

18:19:49 Coach: So, would you say that's more like due to school?

18:19:53 Participant: Yeah.

18:20:01 Coach: Well, going back to your goal. I'm so sorry, the scale question first and then I'll go more into like... On a scale of one to 10, how did you do with your goal? How do you think you did?

18:20:22 Participant: Sorry, I mean I think I... I didn't like... I think I could have done better, but I am also very like hard on myself so I think I did pretty good to like also take into consideration like the stress that I was under, like how fast paced everything was during that week for me. So, yeah.

18:20:55 Coach: I'm so sorry, just a number. I would say... one through 10?

18:21:00 Participant: Five.

18:21:02 Coach: So you said five. Yes. Gotcha. Okay. So tell me a little bit about how it went. Where were your successes, what were your challenges?

18:21:16 Participant: I think some challenges for me were trying to find time in a busy schedule to like, focus on, like me, and like my goals. Because I definitely had a lot of other things that I had to kind of set as those priorities, but I think it's not even finding that like determination anymore, it's more finding like the balance of time. But yeah, definitely. I mean, definitely did meet at least, like my goals by going, but I struggled to find like time.

18:22:07 Coach: And then, if I remember correctly, one of the goals was around taking food to work right?

18:22:07 Participant: Yes.

18:22:09 Coach: Were you able to take some meals to work?

18:22:14 Participant: Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think it was like what, twice a week or was it more than twice a week? I don't remember. I'm sorry, I would have to look it up but... no I think I tried to do it a couple days, and there was a day where like, I even took it to the office and I didn't eat it. I just didn't... yeah I was like, "huh." But I'm really craving this, so I was like kind of like "well self care also, it's been stressful so let's treat myself" kind of thing. But, yeah, like the levels of stress that you were under really impacted like my poor choices.

18:22:54 Coach: No, I was just gonna say like impacted you from like achieving your goals, which is totally understandable and that happens. Like we can't expect life to be smooth sailing 100% of the time. What for the days that you did meet your goals, what were some of the positives that you observed in yourself? I'm just going to use like a random example but I've had participants who drink water, and then they're like "oh yeah my skin is smoother" or like "I feel better like when I go to bed." So, on the days that you know you were able to meet your goals, any positive outcomes?

18:23:45 Participant: I think something like... instead of like instant gratification was probably more like... when I would, when I did go out and like, you know, exercise, I like came back and I was like tired by like, let's say, 10pm, and I went to bed and got to sleep early, which made my next morning, next morning, a lot easier to like get up and, you know, go to work and get my routine going. So I kind of set me more like in a better routine and I was like I had energy and then it was like... Like everything kind of like... it was a very, like, scheduling, like, they all kind of came together. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, so I feel like it definitely helped. Like I saw an instant... like if I didn't work out, if I didn't do those goals, then, I probably would have had, like, a really like bad morning kind of thing and I had like a hard morning, you know, so it was definitely helpful to do that.

18:25:08 Coach: Yeah, I think what I'm hearing... I wrote down some stuff but reflecting it back to you. It helped you like prepare you for success the next day. Cool. Well, that's really awesome to hear. I hope that you know making those connections motivates you or keeps you on track to exercising at night, but also expressing self compassion when necessary.

18:25:44 Coach: So, before we... sorry, was there anything else you want to say about your goals from this last week, positive challenges?

18:25:57 Participant: Not really. I just kind of like actually kind of like I saw like... when I do implement these things like these positive things like I get like a... it's just like more like set up for like success than I... So I was like "oh ok let's do this more so I don't you know I'm not tired in the morning and grumpy." So, yeah.

18:26:22 Coach: Yeah, I think that's super notable. Kind of like, not like alerts in like the red flashy way but like fireworks like "this is awesome." Okay. So, before we transition to talking about your goals this week, I'd like to circle back to the messages and ask what were your thoughts about the messages? Did any of them stand out to you? Did they motivate you in any way? Other comments?

18:27:02 Participant: I think I told you this already but like I'm like really into like infographics. So I think this week I noticed like the self care bingo and I was actually working on like implementing a lot of like self care during like the weekend. So like I definitely checked off a few and I was like "okay like there's other things that I could, you know like, do as well that would be considered self care" so like that little bingo thing. And I love Canada, and then there was... I think the other one, it was like how are you kind of sitting here like yoga pose one, and I love that one too.

18:28:09 Coach: Okay, cool. So, it sounds like the bingo one also gave you some ideas on like other ways to take care of yourself, and then with the reflection one I wonder... Did you take some time to, like, like two minutes to be with yourself, be present, or was it just kind of like, "Oh, this is neat" and then moved on?

18:28:20 Participant: Yeah, I kind of read it, and I thought about it but I actually didn't implement it, I was like "okay well like I do some things that I wouldn't really consider self care but are self care."

18:28:35 Coach: Any other comments about the text messages?

18:28:41 Participant: No I don't think so. I think they're very helpful.

18:28:45 Coach: Okay, cool. And then, so to quickly note your text messages will end on Sunday. So, this is the last week that we'll be doing health coaching but we're still going to set up a health goal. And then following this... I would like to set up one last meeting with you but it'll be to ask for your feedback about the program. So, yeah, let's go ahead and do your goals for this week, and then I'll tell you more about that.

18:29:26 Participant: For this week... yeah I think I could, like, use the same, just because I don't feel like I... now that I don't have that... I have these like next two weeks off of like school. I'm like I'm done, I could definitely work on like getting back to it so I think I could keep the same.

18:29:49 Coach: So let me look back on our previous week. I might just take me a few minutes to...

18:29:59 Participant: That's fine.

18:30:28 Coach: Random question, are you undergrad or grad student?

18:30:32 Participant: I'm a grad student.

18:30:34 Coach: Okay. And this is I'm assuming this is for your program right?

18:30:38 Participant: Yes, well not necessarily. So for my program we have to do an internship, and the internships vary. So some people are like working at UCSF. Some people are working like other government programs. But for me, I'm doing this research project with Dr. Lingle who I'm not sure if you know who that is. But, so we're trying to see if this program can be beneficial to students, so like getting that feedback, and then also thinking about offering it to like more students. So right now there's three health coaches, but our team has, like, five to six people, there's like one person who kind of shows up... kind of no judgment, just kind of how it goes. But yeah, so those three health coaches though.

18:32:03 Coach: And then... sorry, I saw... Are you on the main campus or are you at the... because I know I don't think we have that program at the Sacramento campus?

18:32:10 Participant: Yeah, so I'm not exactly sure what programs the Sacramento campus has but I'm at the main campus. What about you?

18:32:23 Coach: Yeah, I'm up at Sacramento campus. I applied for the main campus, and then COVID hit, and I wasn't trying to move out there because I was going to quit my job in Sacramento so I was gonna quit my job and then go out there and live and I was like, "how am I going to be able to afford rent?" and I was like "yeah no I'll just stay here."

18:32:49 Participant: Yeah, I actually commute to San Francisco and live in Santa Cruz, which I mean, rent wise is not any better, but I work here and it worked out.

18:33:06 Coach: Wow, that's a long commute.

18:33:10 Participant: Yes. Luckily it was just like once, maybe twice a week with the classes, but then COVID hit, and then we just got to work from home... I know it's always like a protocol and that's all... I got like so lucky I was like "well I mean it works out I could stay and do everything on Zoom and I don't have to pay for gas."

18:33:33 Coach: Yeah. There's definitely been some... a lot of cons, but some pros. Do you know anybody from Santa Cruz?

18:33:54 Participant: So I used to go to CSU Monterey Bay for my undergrad. And I used to commute from Monterey to Santa Cruz for my internship as well. And so it was like the last year that I was like, it wasn't that bad but I think the times that I went because I used to work at the mall... At the, what is it, the Museum of Art History. And so, yeah, it was like the hours were weird and it was different days and just like I would get all the traffic coming back to Monterey, and so I think that's what made the commute longer, but it was definitely nice, because I think that, like Santa Cruz is just very, like, I don't know, it's my vibe, more than anything, it's very relaxed. So, yeah, definitely miss it, but now I'm back in Sacramento and I applied to USF I got in last year and I've never actually been to the main campus, so I do hope... will you be... so when you start in the fall or do you have classes in the fall?

18:35:05 Coach: Yeah, so we're supposed to start fall in person like a hybrid, so like, and we have to go in. But luckily, I had to reapply to the program here at Sacramento since I kind of told them like I'm not... I mean I could have started with that cohort but I would have had to leave, if it came down to like in person I would have to leave to go to the main campus. And so I would have to... now that I switched over, I get to commit to the Sacramento one instead of the San Francisco. So it kind of worked out, but I'm still kind of bummed that I actually haven't actually seen the campus but one day, one day.

18:35:52 Participant: It's not like a traditional campus, it's just kind of blends in with the rest of San Francisco. Yeah, that's what... I mean I've been to San Francisco so many times, and actually, like, two weekends ago I went, I think just for like... I didn't... I ended up going to like a brunch place, and I was like, I saw the signs and then I realized that I was like really close to the campus, but I didn't see like an actual campus, and then I was like, "Hmm, maybe it's just like a business building or something like that."

18:36:29 Coach: Yeah. It's really difficult to navigate because they blend so well with the city. The only I guess feature, are the stairs, like you know the... Maybe you've seen photos of the like stairs that... And then they have like a grassy area between the stairs.

18:36:51 Participant: Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:36:51 Coach: That's the only thing that I feel like makes it stand out as a university. All the other buildings blend in with San Francisco.

18:37:03 Participant: And I don't know what the Sacramento campus looks like so I wonder if that's... Yeah, no, it's literally like, I don't know if you've been to Sacramento, but I don't know if you like the golden... not the golden bridge but the yellow bridge. I'm not remembering yellow bridge but... ok so the iconic like I think like the touristy place of Sacramento in the downtown area, it's literally like a business building attached to it so it's nothing like an actual campus, it's just like a building like you'll miss it if you drive by.

18:37:44 Coach: That's happened to me at USF a lot of times. Yeah, I wonder if it's like, just because it's a smaller university compared to like, UC Berkeley or CSU Monterey, all those places.

18:38:07 Participant: Yeah, but you would think that there's like two universities in San Francisco so like... What is it, San Fran State and then USF, like, maybe really like I don't know... Have you seen the CSU San Francisco?

18:38:30 Coach: No, I haven't, but I had a friend that went there and like their student life looked like it was an actual campus. So, yeah, I'm sure.

18:38:44 Participant: Yeah. I don't... I visited the campus once, but I got the same vibe where they just kind of blended in with the city.

18:38:53 Coach: Yeah, maybe. Yeah, San Francisco really doesn't have a lot of land. But I was able to find my notes from our last session. And so, you had like two goals. One was to be physically active for at least 30 minutes on four different days. And then the second goal was, you would prepare three lunch meals for the week. So were those the two that you want to do again?

18:39:34 Participant: Yeah, we could keep it the same.

18:39:38 Coach: Let's start with the first physically active one. So, it says in the next week you'll be physically active for at least 30 minutes on four different days.

18:40:11 Participant: Yeah, I think it's definitely obtainable, because I did say... I think I did three. Yeah, I went twice and then once more... so yeah I went. Yeah, so I did three so I could definitely reach that this week now that I won't have as much of a workload.

18:40:40 Coach: And then, is there anything that you need support wise for this? For example, some people find it helpful to set up calendar blocks as a reminder, or so that they can manage their time better. Something along those lines.

18:41:08 Participant: No, I think I can handle it. I mean, I definitely have more downtime. So, yeah.

18:41:17 Coach: Last week when we talked about like the relevance of this goal like why is it important to you, you said this will help increase your energy and be a healthier person, as well as boost your self esteem and confidence level. Do those still feel appropriate or would you like to add something?

18:41:51 Participant: Those are fine.

18:41:54 Coach: And then on a scale of one to 10, what's your level of confidence in meeting your SMART goal?

18:42:01 Participant: I'd say a 10.

18:42:06 Coach: Alrighty, So then for the second goal. In the next week you will prepare three lunch meals for the week. Should we add like prepare and eat?

18:42:21 Participant: Yeah I mean we can be specific, I definitely do probably... It doesn't... them.

18:42:34 Coach: Okay, so I'll say you will prepare three lunch meals for the week. Does that still feel like relevant to you?

18:42:42 Participant: Yeah, that's definitely relevant, I still need to work on that.

18:42:50 Coach: And then, talking about like it's important... Last week you mentioned, it was part of its importance came from like reducing your purchasing of fast food, and then also wanting to have a balanced diet, watch what you put in your body, and live a healthier and longer life.

18:43:17 Participant: Yeah, that's definitely still relevant.

18:43:20 Coach: Do you want to add anything?

18:43:23 Participant: No, we can keep that.

18:43:33 Coach: And then, so for the obtainable piece. Do you want to keep it to three meals?

18:43:43 Participant: Yeah, let's not increase that. I don't want to push it for sure.

18:43:50 Coach: Okay, so, on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

18:43:56 Participant: I could definitely do... I'll do an 8.

18:44:09 Coach: So, for this last week, when you have this goal, were you able to prepare some meals?

18:44:20 Participant: Yeah, I actually was, all the other days. Except I don't know like I think... well I don't know why but I don't really like... when it comes down to it like I don't know I like meal prep them and I make them and then once it gets like to, you know, like lunchtime or whenever I'm eating it like I just don't like... I'd rather not and so either I don't eat it and then I just don't have lunch or I just go out and I don't know grab a coffee and then I'll just... Like, it's not really...

18:44:58 Coach: That's a tough position to be in like making food, working towards this goal and then once it comes down to it... Yeah. I think also because maybe like I was really stressed and so like when I'm stressed I like either... like I stress eat when I'm like actively doing something, or like when I'm at home or something I stress eat a lot, or when I'm really stressed out I don't eat like I'd rather supplement it with like caffeine which is really terrible but... So it's kind of like coping as well with like stress. Well, hopefully stressful situations are now reduced, and you can really focus on implementing this goal, like having like those perfect conditions, so to speak. Yeah, you can eat the meals that you cooked for yourself. Any other goals that you want to work towards or modify?

18:46:16 Participant: No I think that's it. Those are my main ones.

18:46:26 Coach: Okay, cool. So, since this is our last coaching session, I just have like a couple questions around kind of your experience, not necessarily feedback but do you feel that you've like gained something from these last four weeks in terms of establishing health goals for yourself?

18:46:45 Participant: Yeah, definitely. I think it's definitely helped having like a health coach, like, kind of like keep you like on track and have like a guideline and like set goal setting's definitely been beneficial.

18:47:06 Coach: Thank you. I've really enjoyed working with you too. And so with the program we've tried to work on two skills, one around setting health goals using the SMART goals. And then, problem solving, which is like looking at those challenges and seeing what solutions can come of it. Do you feel those are skills that you have grown in?

18:47:36 Participant: Sorry, can you say that one more time?

18:47:39 Coach: So, for the coaching, we worked on setting like SMART goals and skill... or sorry it was called, problem solving, and so we tried to approach those by building your skills in those areas.

18:47:59 Participant: Yeah I think I definitely like improved in those life skills and problem solving skills. Yeah, definitely.

18:48:14 Coach: Yeah. I think about for me it's hard to do like health goals, SMART goals and then like probably use them all the time. But okay, cool. Do you have any other like questions for me? It could be about school or about the health coaching or the program.

18:48:39 Participant: Oh, yeah, so like I guess I remember signing like a consent for like the data and stuff like that. I'm sure someone will analyze it and see like how effective it is and like you know whether it you know, kind of, like, gets implemented in the future and stuff like that. I mean, because I think it would be cool to like open it up to like all USF students or like, you know, in the long run, kind of thing, but I don't know I found it very beneficial, at least you know for like being a student and like kind of stressful to juggle everything so definitely very helpful.

18:49:25 Coach: And so right now we haven't started analyzing the data. But that's the next phase of this probably over the summer. And we're hoping to establish a program like this at USF. But we won't know until we present to like funders that we can get money to keep doing this. So the future is a little bit up in the air, but that's our goal is to collect the data, analyze the data and present it in a way that supports or gets people to support the program for the future. And then, you mentioned like having signed the consent form and having your data collected. I'm not sure if you had any concerns there but your name and your data is not connected. So, it's anonymous.

18:50:38 Participant: Yeah. No, I was just worried... more of like are not worried but like more like, I guess, questions around like the process of it being like presented and stuff but...

18:50:56 Coach: Yeah. So we do have some quantitative features like those scale questions are easy to like, "Oh, this person said a five, or they said, eight, or 10." The other notes, which is the qualitative part... I'm taking this research class right now so I feel like those are in my head, but we code it until we find themes. So like for example maybe people setting goals around physical activity and then, "this is what they said about that." Or "people found health coaching beneficial. This is what people said about that." So, that's how we look at that data.
 All right. So then our next one would be... how far out are... like our last one, since this is our last one, the other one's just like more of like feedback for you, correct?

18:52:01 Participant: Yeah, so we can transition to doing that now. So, this last meeting is for you to provide feedback about your experience, and you won't meet with me, you'll meet with someone else. And so you can provide that honest feedback. Before you meet with them we ask that you fill out another survey, and it'll be a short survey like, 15 minutes maybe. And then the person will ask you, specific questions about your experience.

18:52:39 Coach: Yeah, so, do you want... would next week be okay for that?

18:52:47 Participant: Yeah that works.

18:52:50 Coach: You want to do six to seven on Wednesday?

18:53:01 Participant: Six to seven works.

18:53:03 Coach: Okay. I'm sorry I forgot to mention, this meeting would be a little longer than our normal health coaching sessions. So I'll add you to the invite now, and hopefully you'll get that shortly. And then I'll try to get the survey to be sent to you either tonight or tomorrow.

18:53:43 Participant: Sounds good.

18:53:47 Coach: And then, yeah, that concludes our health coaching. Like I said before, I really enjoyed working with you and I hope that you've gained a lot out of this program.

18:54:03 Participant: Yeah. Well thank you so much. It definitely did help you know kind of really get me back on track. I think it was definitely helpful. So I do appreciate everything that you did.

18:54:14 Coach: Yeah, feel free to reach out through text or email, and who knows, maybe we'll run into each other on campus, one of these days.
