20:16:26 Participant: Good how are you?

20:16:27 Coach: I'm doing good thanks so much for joining on today. No, I heard you had some things going on yesterday, did that work out okay?

20:16:39 Participant: Yeah, my dog. She's suffering from seizures. So we had to take her to the vet, to the hospital, like the hospital. And yeah, that was like really scary but I think she's doing better I don't know but she's like, 14 so she's really old. But yeah, thanks for asking.

20:17:02 Coach: I'm sorry to hear and I wish her good recovery. Hang in there, girl. Um, well, I know this is our first health coaching session so I do have a bit of an introduction for us. And so bear with me. And, and then we'll just hop into, like, what you're hoping for with this intervention and your health goals.

20:17:39 Participant: Okay. Sounds good.

20:17:39 Coach: So, um, the first thing I want to just talk about is the program itself. It's two parts. One part is the daily text messages that you're, you should be getting already. And then the second part is the health coaching and so that's what we're here today to do. And my role as your health coach, I'll meet with you once a week through Zoom for about 20 minutes. I can meet with you a little bit longer if that's something that you're interested in, but I want to be mindful of your time. And then also, I'll check in with you, um, through text message in between our sessions just to check in on your progress and to see if there's anything that I can do. Um, if any questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise as a health coach, I'll let you know, and get you connected to the appropriate resource. So one example could be maybe you're interested in getting connected to therapy to like support your mental health. I'm not a therapist, and so I'll let you know like, hey, unfortunately, I'm not a therapist, but I can help you get connected to one. Yeah. And the other important factor about this is that this is a research study and we will be collecting data, but our specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be de-identified, so your name and like what we work on will be separate. So I just want to let you know that so you can be mindful about how much you share and it's within your comfort zone. By the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around, problem solving and goal setting, as a way to feel empowered about your physical, mental and - sorry - spiritual mental and physical health, those are the three, and then beyond this program. I want to just thank you for your participation and let you know that your participation is going to let us know whether we can offer this program to more students, and in a large scale setting. So, in case you're curious like what is the point of all this. It is to support you and it is to support, like, a larger number of students.

20:20:23 Participant: Sounds good.

20:20:25 Coach: Um. Any questions before we get started?

20:20:25 Participant: I guess I'm just wondering if I can know if like you're a grad student or like what position, are you at USF?

20:20:36 Coach: Yeah. Um, so I'm currently a grad student in the Masters of Public Health Program. Um, this is my second year, and beyond my role as a grad student, I have a full time job and work at UC Santa Cruz. So, um, yeah.

20:20:58 Participant: So you commute to San Francisco or just go into Santa Cruz?

20:21:01 Coach: When we're in person. Yes, but right now, no because everything's online.

20:21:09 Participant: What about you, what are you studying or what year are you?

20:21:09 Coach: Oh I guess I'm your psychology major at USF. Obviously, and I'm minor, a double minor in dance and neuroscience. I started, I like just finished your soda so it like burned my nose. Oh no. I dance a lot kind of on the dance team the contemporary dance team. Um, I yeah that's pretty much about me. I apply for research program at UPenn, hoping to get that I hear back from that soon. But yeah, I have no research experience so far. Even though I'm a sophomore psychology major So, yeah, I'm hoping to get that in soon. Because I do want to go to grad school, in the future.

20:22:13 Participant: That's awesome. Yeah, I very much relate to a lot of the stuff that you're that you've mentioned. In my undergrad I didn't participate in research and this is one of my first exposures to it. So, you're never too young and you're never too old, so to speak.

20:22:34 Coach: Yeah, you're right. But that's awesome that you're thinking about the future and like you have a good sense of direction.  Awesome. Um, so with this program and our sessions I do ask like a few standardized questions just to check in. And also, it can help guide our conversation. One of them is around your stress level. So, on a scale of one to 10, what would you say your stress level was like this week. Oh, I'm sorry, one is not stressed and 10 is like super stressed.

20:23:13 Participant: I would say, just because like I know it was unexpected and like from one day to the next. She just like got really severe seizures and that was not expected plus like on top of the pandemic obviously, and school, so 10.

20:23:29 Coach: Yeah, a lot of things happening all at once. Um, can you hear me well? It says my connection is unstable.

20:23:37 Participant: I can hear you well yes.

20:23:41 Coach: Um, you know, and when participants respond with a 10. Um, it's definitely something worth talking about and seeing if you want to set a health goal around your stress level or stress management. We don't have to go in that direction if you don't want to, but I do want to offer this space to like debrief about it more.

20:24:09 Participant: Sure, I'd like to.

20:24:14 Coach: Okay. Um, so, other things that. Okay, sorry, let me pause that for a second and ask if there was a goal that you had going into this program, like, what were your motivations in participating in this program?

20:24:37 Participant: Um, I guess I just want to be held accountable because I do like want to work out but then I don't have the motivation to do so. I do like want to eat healthy but then like, I don't know where to start. And then I do want to like lower my stress levels but like I kind of know where to start, but then again like I want to be held accountable for that. And then, um, yeah I just like participating in studies, I think it's really cool.

20:25:09 Coach: So those are all really good things and, um, well, you do have good goals, it can be overwhelming trying to do everything at once and when your stress level's at a 10 like maybe we need to start there and then like, fold in the physical activity and like the eating healthy practices. We do have four weeks together and so if you want we can start with this goal, and then work towards the other ones as well.

20:25:43 Participant: Sure.

20:25:43 Coach: And then also, before we go into a little more of that I do want to ask about the text messages. What are your thoughts about the text messages and have any of them stood out to you?

20:25:57 Participant: Um, yeah so this morning I got like the make time for physical activity, and I literally got it when I was like on a walk with my dad so that was like the perfect timing. And then maybe if like, yeah, maybe twice a day, that would be helpful.

20:26:23 Coach: Okay. Yeah, we don't have more messages. But I will be texting you about every other day or every three days or so just to check in, but I do like your feedback and I wish we would have done more messages.

20:26:44 Participant: No worries. But I, to answer your question I do like them.

20:26:59 Coach: Okay, cool. Yeah, that's one of the questions that I'll ask you during our sessions. Just to get any feedback on them. So, stress management, if you want to start there.

20:27:01 Participant: I would like to do yoga, stretches and meditation, those are like the top two that I've noticed, really help with my stress and anxiety, as well. Um, my mom likes to run so I sometimes run with her when she runs like short distance. And that has also helped me a lot. And then dancing is like my outlet, basically.

20:27:43 Coach: Yeah, so you already have like a lot of good things to turn to. What's your routine or your consistency like?

20:27:59 Participant: It's bad, like once a month.

20:28:03 Coach: So, um, would it be fair to say you want to, like, create a routine around this and be more consistent? Um, so, with the goals that we set, we like to set them in the SMART format, have you heard of SMART goals? Okay, so SMART is an acronym that stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely, so we keep the format of the goals fairly similar, and the time we set for them is about a week. So one example could be in the next week, I will ride my bike for 20 minutes for five, for seven days. So we give it, we make it very specific, we measure it by the days that I'm riding my bike. It's attainable because I have a bike and I have 20 minutes in my schedule, and then it's relevant to me because I want to increase my physical activity, and because I like bike riding. So, with your health goal, we're going to start off in the same similar format. So in the next week you will, and then you let me know how you'd like to fill in the blank.

20:29:34 Participant: In the next week, I will practice yoga or Pilates four times a week.

20:29:50 Coach: So, this is a really good goal. If I knew how to spell Pilates. So in the next week you'll practice yoga or Pilates four times in the week, we can make this more specific by specifying which of the four days that you will be doing this, or the time of day so like morning or afternoon, evening something along those lines. We don't have to but I'm just giving you that option.

20:30:47 Participant: Let's do Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

20:31:04 Coach: So I did change up the order a little bit because we're meeting on Thursday, not Monday. So I put Friday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. So you'll do this Friday. So tomorrow. Does that work okay?

20:31:27 Participant: Yeah so Friday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday.

20:31:37 Coach: Um, and so with this goal. Do you have like a day, or a specific time in the day that would work better for you?

20:31:53 Participant: Let's do in the morning. So again, specify the time, 9am.

20:32:04 Coach: Cool this is a really good goal it's rounding out really nicely, um, do you use any like phone reminders, calendar reminders, anything like that to help you? Would it be helpful to put it in your calendar?

20:32:27 Participant: Um, I mean I actually do have it already, but I don't do it.

20:32:44 Coach: I'm wondering what else would be helpful to, like, help you do this activity.

20:32:58 Participant: I feel like this program is going to help me become more accountable. So, okay, maybe reminders.

20:33:06 Coach: Yeah, I'll send you a little text message, like reminders. And then do you have like videos or like the knowledge around yoga and Pilates like?

20:33:27 Participant: Um, yeah I've been practicing it for a while. Since like freshman year of high school, um, and I just because I guess like each day I feel a different way. So some days I look up on YouTube like yoga for stress or like morning yoga, like bed yoga so yeah I do know like where to research.

20:33:51 Coach: And then about how long do you usually do yoga or Pilates for?

20:34:02 Participant: 20 minutes.

20:34:02 Coach: So for 20 minutes. That's a good amount of time. And then we touched upon this a little earlier but why is this practice of yoga and Pilates important to you?

20:34:25 Participant: Because I feel more connected to my body and I feel like I can fully relax, through yoga or meditation.

20:34:42 Coach: Cool. So I think you've created a really SMART goal, and I'm just going to repeat it back to you to make sure I captured it accurately. So in the next week you will practice yoga or Pilates for 20 minutes, four times, specifically on Friday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at nine o'clock in the morning. Um, so one way to assess whether this is a good SMART goal is to think about your confidence. So, on a scale of one to ten, where one is like not confident and ten is confident, how would you rate your level of confidence, in meeting your SMART goal?

20:36:00 Participant: Let's do six.

20:36:03 Coach: Is there anything that we can do to change your SMART goal to boost your confidence level. I can give one example. So right now you have it for four times out of the week. If we bump that down to three times, will you feel more confident in meeting your goal?

20:36:33 Participant: Sorry you cut out I didn't hear.

20:36:36 Coach: Would you like to make that change or do you want to try four?

20:36:38 Participant: Now because I don't do anything. I guess like from doing nothing to four times a week.

20:36:54 Coach: So, what does your confidence level change to now?

20:37:02 Participant: Seven.

20:37:02 Coach: All right, that's a nice little boost. And then you also had Friday, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Do you want to keep all those four days or do you want me to delete one of those days?

20:37:24 Participant: Let's do Friday, Monday and Thursday.

20:37:35 Coach: I think that's a good starting point. Um, so let me, I already repeated it, do you have any questions about the SMART goal or any concerns? Can they be different each week? They can be, if you want them to be. Additionally, we can set two SMART goals. If you want to do a little more. I just want to be mindful of like your capacity.

20:38:08 Participant: Can we add one, maybe like a small 20 minute workout, like once a week?

20:38:17 Coach: So in the next week you will work out for 20 minutes, once a week. And then, do you want to specify a time?

20:38:32 Participant: Wednesday at 9am.

20:38:36 Coach: And then, do you want to specify like how you're going to work out, for example, like maybe it's a cardio or it's an ab workout or, do you have, like, something in mind when you say workout?

20:38:59 Participant: I usually just do like a 20 minute cardio workout on YouTube. I like to watch this girl named Lily Sabri.

20:39:16 Coach: Cardio workout on YouTube. Okay, so you have like the resources that you need to meet this goal. And also it's something that, what's the word, like you already have it on your calendar. And then, to make it relevant like why is this one important to you, like working out, doing cardio for 20 minutes?

20:39:46 Participant: Because I don't necessarily want to lose weight but I just want to get toned.

20:39:59 Coach: So, a little deeper. Like, why is it important for you to have a toned body, like what does it do for you?

20:40:10 Participant: It just makes me feel better about myself. So you mentioned a really good point, I do have all the resources, but like the motivation is what I lack right now, if that makes sense.

20:40:27 Coach: What, um, what do you think can help you like be more motivated towards this?

20:40:38 Participant: I guess like whenever I do it I feel really good afterward, really relaxed. But before I do it, I'm like, should I do it should I not do it. And then I just spend like hours on my phone and then I don't do anything.

20:40:56 Coach: So it sounds like your phone can be somewhat of a barrier. Do you, go ahead, sorry to interrupt you. Um, so, do you watch like the YouTube videos on your phone, or do you do them on your laptop?

20:41:22 Participant: On my laptop or on my TV.

20:41:27 Coach: So what's a way that you can, well, I mean, I don't want to like go Nike, but like, just do it, like what's going to help you get there?

20:41:41 Participant: Um, I guess like knowing that I have a program that's like kind of holding me accountable is gonna help me, like, get up. And then, like go work out or do yoga. And then hopefully like after it's gonna just become natural.

20:42:13 Coach: I mean, just knowing, like, habit formation can be really difficult like in your major. So setting these really doable goals will help you establish the routine that you're looking for. I think in moments where you start questioning yourself and you're like, should I, and I'm just speaking for myself I don't know what's going on with you but I'll speak for myself, like, for me to spend 20 minutes doing yoga and feeling better and relaxed afterwards. And just reminding yourself that this is a really powerful tool, and it's just 20 minutes, like, a third of an hour. It goes by like that in a day. But I think you'll find yourself really appreciative that you take care of yourself in that way.

20:43:32 Participant: Yeah. Yeah, I know. It goes by like that in a day but when you're doing it it's like two minutes passed by and then, yeah, no, but that does help.

20:43:40 Coach: And, um, if you find that next week when we check in, you're like hey, I didn't meet my goal, I'll be like, that's okay. Tell me what happened. And we can do some problem solving, and we can look at what do we need to change about your goal, do we need to set it for 10 minutes instead of 20. Or maybe it's not yoga, that you really want to do or cardio, you know, we can definitely make it more personal to you so that you can feel successful and continue to improve your health.

20:44:20 Participant: Sounds good.

20:44:20 Coach: Um, so, with your second goal, I'm just going to repeat it back to you and then let me know your confidence level. So in the next week you will work out for 20 minutes on Wednesday at 9am, using a cardio workout video on YouTube.

20:44:47 Participant: 9.5.

20:44:47 Coach: That's good. I'm gonna bump that up to a 10 because 9.5 is like basically there. Um, well I think you've set really good goals for yourself. And I will email these to you. Hopefully tonight if not by tomorrow. As just a gentle reminder that this is what you're working on. Do you need any resources, or support with this besides like checking in with text messages?

20:45:21 Participant: Now I think I'm fine.

20:45:23 Coach: I think you're good. Okay. Yeah. Well, I'm excited for you I hope you're feeling excited too.

20:45:31 Participant: I'm just writing it in my planner so I don't forget it.

20:45:43 Coach: Oh wait, oh wait for you to do that because while you're using your calendar we should schedule our next coaching session. Okay, so Monday is yoga. And then Thursday is yoga. Correct. And then Wednesday's just working out. Cool. So with our next coaching session. Does this time on Thursday work best or do you want to move that to another day?

20:46:27 Participant: Can we do a Wednesday at this time?

20:46:32 Coach: Let me just double check. Um, so next Wednesday at 8:15. And then, um, for the 20th, or the following week. Let me see just double check my calendar. It's going to be the 21st, do you want to do this time as well or do you want to do the Thursday time?

20:47:08 Participant: I know actually on Thursdays I have something from eight to 9:30. So let's do Wednesday as well, or we can also do Tuesday.

20:47:22 Coach: Tuesday is the day that I have class until like nine something that's why. So, okay. Yeah. So you want to do the 21st at, I can do 6:15. Can we do 8:30? And then we have the 21st at 6:15. And then we have one more after that, what do you want to do the 28th at 6:15?

20:47:30 Participant: Yes.

20:48:35 Coach: I'll send you Google invites so, you know, you'll have that for reference. Any other questions before we sign off?

20:48:50 Participant: I think that's, that's all for now, but thank you so much for meeting with me.

20:48:58 Coach: Yeah, of course.
