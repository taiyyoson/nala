20:33:58 Coach: Are you doing good, how are you?

20:33:58 Participant: I'm okay. I'm just on a different computer because my computer just doesn't work. Let me see. Oh, there we go.

20:34:16 Coach: How are you doing today besides like the computer stuff?

20:34:21 Participant: I'm okay. I feel like I'm still stressing about stuff.

20:34:27 Coach: On a scale of one to 10, what's your stress level?

20:34:32 Participant: I think it's like a four or five. My brown dog got hurt on her ear so she's like been bleeding until like I cleaned out her ear a little bit, and then I put the cone on her, but I feel like I might have to take her to the vet tomorrow. I was just going to see how she would be today. She was letting me touch it, but she was like still bleeding. So there's that. I might go to LA this weekend, like tomorrow I might fly out there but I have to check with my dad to see if I do.

20:35:15 Coach: What's in LA?

20:35:18 Participant: So, I had cousins... Sorry, I'm making mental notes right now of like, making sure I have my flight, and the car rental. So, I had cousins who lived down the street from me. And then they moved to New York, and then they moved to Texas so I haven't seen these cousins in like 15 years or something. Now they're in LA, and my brother told me about it a few days ago, and he's like "oh you should go, we haven't seen them" like I should go, like I want to go you know.

20:36:18 Coach: I guess for today's session, where would you like to go? What like for today's session, what do you want to start with? Do you want to start with the text messages or check in about this week's goals?

20:36:36 Participant: I think check in about this week's goals if that's okay.

20:36:39 Coach: Yeah, definitely. So, on a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did in meeting your goals?

20:36:52 Participant: Which goals are we talking about? I think for the like the fruit one, I think I did well, I made sure to eat bananas, or strawberries. So that was good. I went to the store and I bought a bag of cuties as well. I showed my friends I was like "look look I'm eating fruits like I'm trying to eat healthy," she was like "wow I'm so proud of you." The water one has been so-so. I think like the fruit one I'd give it an eight out of 10. The water one was so-so. I killed my plant twice. Yeah. I'm on the right side so when I first started at USF. The professors gave us like a goody bag. And so I thought it was going to have like USF stuff you know like the USF sweatshirt, but, you know, they gave us like this candle that smells good or whatever, they gave us like a picture of the beach because it helps them like calm down and we should look at something calming every day or something. And then this one teacher gave us like this cup of soil that apparently had marigold seeds. And so you just add water and they grow, so I had that plant on my floor and I just kept knocking it over every other day and I was just like "whatever, I'll leave it there" and I was like "wait." I feel like almost a year later I wonder if there's still seeds in there. So I left it on my window sill thing. I added water. And I didn't do well on a test. So I went into my room to cry and I was like "I just destroyed this test," but my little plant started growing, and I was like "oh my god like after a year like it actually grew like, what," so I have that. But it can't keep me on the stupid plant on my phone app. Okay, the one on the phone is fake and it's just supposed to help you track your water drinking. But even though I have not been drinking my eight glasses of water, I have been doing like three or four. Some days I have had eight. But most days I have like three or four so I have definitely brought up how much water I drink.

20:39:27 Coach: No, that's good. And then you also had a walking goal right. Did that happen this week?

20:39:36 Participant: That did not happen. I had four presentations due, my students had a test, I had a test this week. That did not happen this week.

20:39:48 Coach: Okay, no worries, no worries. How did that go for you in terms of any feelings come up, like energy levels or anything?

20:40:12 Participant: I did feel more energetic, you know, but I think I was annoyed with the text messages where I was like, "All right, cool like I'll eat" and then like "oh wait no I need to eat," and then like at night, I was like, "oh shit I did not eat, let me do that now." And I would do it, you know. So they were helpful, they were very helpful, but like, one of them I got during a test, I'm like "why right now, why am I getting this message right now I'm taking this test," you know, I don't know it's not your fault. It wasn't that, like, after my test I was like "okay now I can eat my fruit," you know, I was more stressed about my test than anything else. Yeah, but they were very helpful. I enjoyed getting the messages because like, even if I ignored it like it was still there bugging me like "eat your fruit" it's like, "All right, let me go to my room," so... No, the text messages... No, and they were helpful like it reminded me to eat, you know.

20:41:17 Coach: Okay so what do you want to share anything else about your this last week's health goals? For example, the fruit one like you, you feel like you've built the habit and will consume more fruit, is that something that you feel happened or no?

20:41:52 Participant: I think that happened with the water one, the fruit one, not so much. But it's not because I don't want to. It's just because I have to make sure I go out there and buy you know... like the water one like we have water here every single day. The fruit one like, you know like, I will buy a bunch of bananas, and it's like, at the end of the week like they're gonna go bad so I have to go replace them, or even like strawberries, they just go bad, you know, like my strawberries went all bad. Yeah, my strawberries went all bad after like three days or something you know, but it's like I ate all I had when they were there. The walking one I think I would have done more... Excuse me, if I had more time. you know, I think it's also like taking time to build up the habit like I feel like after this week, and just how busy I was I just did not have time for me.

20:43:00 Coach: So let me circle back to the text messages like the daily ones that happen in the morning. I'm not talking about the fruit reminders... What about those messages stood out? Or did any of them stand out. And did they motivate you in any way?

20:43:19 Participant: I don't think I'm motivated by anything besides like seeing them there like reminding me you know it's just like in your face like "you did not eat" like this message is there for you, because if I don't read it like I'm not gonna open it and dismiss it you know I will ignore it for now. And so when I turn on my phone to see my notifications, it's like you can see... but it's like, "oh, like, an hour ago you should have drunk water," you know, so it was about the fruit, you know like, "Oh, you should be eating your fruit." And so I was like, "All right, like let me just do this now let me get it over with."

20:44:22 Coach: So for you because I know you do have such a busy lifestyle. Do you look at them once a day or do you kind of like, let them accumulate and then like look through them?

20:44:34 Participant: I look at my messages like every day whenever I have time, it's horrible how much I'm on my phone. My phone is like my biggest distraction. But if I like see it, and I have time then I will do it then. Okay. Maybe it's happened like once a week or something. But, yeah, I look at my phone to look at my messages, most of the time that's all I use it for. And I will like you know if I have time, I'll do it then and there if I don't, I'll like ignore it to do later.

20:46:07 Coach: Going back to your health goals. What would you like to focus on this week?

20:46:13 Participant: Definitely the water one. I feel like that's an important one to have. I would like to work on the fruit one as well. I don't know what else.

20:46:41 Coach: So, for the water one, in the next week you will... And how would you like me to phrase that for you?

20:46:55 Participant: In the next week I will continue to drink more than four glasses of water a day. In this upcoming week, I will eat fruit, at least twice a day, two servings of fruit a day. Yeah, I don't know what else.

20:47:34 Coach: And then. So for the water one do you want to have it be for the whole week?

20:47:41 Participant: Yeah.

20:47:45 Coach: And we're talking like Sunday to Sunday for example?

20:47:50 Participant: Yes.

20:47:57 Coach: Then what about for the fruit one?

20:48:01 Participant: Same thing.

20:48:06 Coach: And then, what's your confidence level in meeting your water goal?

20:48:12 Participant: I think for like four glasses of water I'm like at a nine for confidence.

20:48:18 Coach: And then the fruit one?

20:48:22 Participant: Also like a nine out of nine.

20:48:28 Coach: So for either of them, what types of things would you need to be successful in meeting your goal?

20:48:39 Participant: I'm gonna say yes on the reminders. No, they're good they're good. Maybe just one reminder a day. I think two is fine, it's just me just like I have to build up the habit, you know, there was like nothing wrong with you like texting me, it was just like me trying to build the habit and like stressing myself out with other things. When it's like I could just eat a fruit to calm down, you know.

20:49:11 Coach: Do you want me to do that again, or no?

20:49:16 Participant: Yeah, you could do it again.

20:49:22 Coach: Do you want me to send them at different times though, rather than the times that we had it set, or are those times fine with you?

20:49:31 Participant: Those times are fine with me.

20:49:38 Coach: Yeah, anything else that you need to help you meet these goals? Maybe the app. I'm not sure if you want to give that a try again or do you want to try another way of tracking the water goal?

20:49:50 Participant: I'm going to use the app. Yeah.

20:50:07 Coach: And then I guess if you could reshare the reasons why these goals are important to you?

20:50:15 Participant: I like the drinking water goal just because I feel like that helps me cut out like tons of sugary drinks from my diet. Like when I think about getting soda or something, it's automatically like "no like I have water at home," you know like, especially if I order in. Same if I go out to eat somewhere like it's like "No, I'll just have a water like it's fine." I think with the fruit one, it's the same, it's like helping me eat something healthy that like you normally... like at least me I normally like wouldn't think about it. I'm more of like, "oh, like I will, you know, eat something else because I don't want to eat fruit," but I feel like fruit is like very very healthy too. So, yeah.

20:51:28 Coach: So I'm wondering about... I think this is our fourth coaching session. So, essentially this is the last time that we meet. Your last meeting won't be with me, it'll be with like another person, just to provide feedback about your experience. I want to be mindful of your time though. Do you want to meet... Do you want to meet next week or the week after, I'm not sure what your schedule is like?

20:52:11 Participant: Next week.

20:52:20 Coach: Oh, when would be a good time for you next week?

20:52:24 Participant: I think that this time works best. The 8:30. Yes, unless that's too late... maybe 8:00 on a Wednesday.

20:52:44 Coach: I'll ask for both times and then... But say that you prefer this time. I don't have a preference either way is fine. So just to say a little more about that, you'll have... So after today's session I'll send you an email like I normally do. Do you need any additional resources, besides what I normally send?

20:53:25 Participant: No, I'm fine, thank you.

20:53:28 Coach: And then, the other thing that you should expect from us is another survey, and the survey should be short like less than 15 minutes, and we ask that you complete that before the meeting on Thursday. And hopefully, yeah I should be... it should be easy. I'll send you the Google invite tonight once I get someone to agree to meet with you. But other than that, I am not sure if you have any other questions or if you want to just check in more about like all the things you have on your plate before signing off, because I feel like I'm getting like a sense that you have like a lot on your plate, and you're stressed.

20:54:22 Participant: Yeah, I don't know, I want to be... But yeah, I think I'm okay. I think knowing that next week is the last week of like grad school, at least for this year like school year is great. I mean I'm taking summer classes too. But I feel like after this week, like, I will be more... not stressed, I will like have afternoons to lay down and be lazy or have afternoons to go on walks with like my dogs and whatnot, you know, but I think right now it's just like how hectic and like how much there was to do. Yeah. And it's been tough to get through the semester, and still trying to be a responsible person.

20:55:14 Coach: Are you taking classes in the fall?

20:55:18 Participant: Yes, I will be in the fall at USF. I think there's two classes, only that I need to take. And then like two in the spring or something.

20:55:25 Coach: Cool. I have one class at USF too so, hopefully, we can like run into each other sometime.

20:55:33 Participant: Yeah. Very cool. Hopefully, yeah, hopefully, I don't know it might be difficult to see like what we look like with masks on but we may have a little plan around just like, "Do you recognize this plant? It's dead but do you recognize me?" That's so funny.

20:55:56 Coach: Well, you're still welcome to text me anytime if you want to do another check in. Well I hope you have a restful evening. What are you doing?

20:56:16 Participant: I'm going to do a lesson plan, I just need to like, edit it and I'm basically done.

20:56:22 Coach: Okay, well, if you want just take a moment and shake it out, stretch, get another cup of water before you get started and hit the ground running. I'll schedule those text message reminders, and you don't have any exams coming up?

20:56:42 Participant: Not right now.

20:56:48 Coach: And, text me if you need anything.

20:56:51 Participant: Okay, thank you, I will.

20:56:55 Coach: Yeah. Alrighty, well, take care.
