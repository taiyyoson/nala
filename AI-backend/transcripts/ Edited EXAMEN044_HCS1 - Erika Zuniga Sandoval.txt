17:56:06 Coach: Hello.  

17:56:08 Participant: Hey, How are you today. Are you okay?  

17:56:22 Coach: Thank you just settling in here.I'm getting up some documents that I need. And then we'll get started. Hello, My name is Erica and thank you so much for joining me today. I want to give you, or just provide you a quick introduction about the program itself and then we can transition into setting your health goals. How does that sound.  

17:56:57 Participant: Sounds good.  

17:57:00 Coach: So first, as you've noticed, examiner sort of a two part intervention and I'm glad that we were able to figure out this intuition with the text messages. And you should be receiving daily text messages moving forward. And the second part of that intervention is meeting with your health coach, which will be new for for the remaining four weeks. So my role is really to meet with you talk to you about what are your health goals review some of the messages that you received during the week and you can give me your feedback on those. But it's really a time for us to talk about your goals. I will be asking you about stress level every week and what you write your stress level. And, but I really want to be able to support you in your progress as you're thinking about goal setting and being able to improve your health and wellness. If at any point questions come up about topics that might be outside of my scope of expertise as a health coach. I will do my best to let you know and also connect to the appropriate resource.  And just remember that this is the research project, I'll be at will be collecting quite a bit of information. However, all the data that we gather will be aggregated at the end and it won't be necessarily attached to your name, so we won't be reporting  on individual data numbers. By the end of the four weeks, we hope that you gain some skills are on problem solving and goal setting and feel empowered, so that you're able to manage your physical health, your mental and spiritual well being. As it relates to your health.  So I really want to thank you for being a participant in our program. Your participation will help us to determine whether this is a program that we could actually implement at a larger scale with all USF students. So thank you so much for or be here. Do you have any questions before we get started. So as we think about. I'm thinking you received quite a few messages all at once, so they may be very fresh in your mind at this point. So I'm tempted to start with that and asking you. What were some of the messages that stood out to you, and have any of them sort of motivate you to move it to you to do something around your health or wellness.  

17:59:37 Participant: Um, well I like the text about the incorporating more. Especially how many fruits and veggies, you should be eating every daybecause I don't eat that many fruits and veggies I feel like I should be eating more I try to incorporate them as much as I can but that usually is maybe one to two servings a day maybe, so I'm trying to figure out a way to try to incorporate more of those kinds of foods in my diet. Yeah, that's my cuckoo clock it's gonna sing for like a minute.  

18:00:14 Coach: No worries. So in thinking about that and now that you mentioned sort of where you are now. Tell me a little bit more about sort of what has brought you to this point, or what are the things that you want to focus on moving forward but tell me a little bit more about like your background on health and wellness and what do you hope to gain from this program.  So, I've always had a very contentious relationship with food. I had an eating disorder in high school, overcame that. And then, About two going on three years ago.I reached my peak weight, I was 217 pounds I'm five eight for reference, I'm pretty tall, but I even though that isn't extremely overweight for my height. When I went into the doctor to get blood work done I was pre diabetic borderline, and diabetes really runs in my family, pretty badly. I have a lot of family members of the diabetes so and have the gene for it obviously since I was already pre diabetic. And so I kind of took health and fitness pretty seriously once I got that news to try and lower my glucose levels, so I am down to about 180 pounds fluctuating between 180 and 85 pounds. My glucose is down.So guess the main main purpose with this is to kind of incorporate more of the diet side of it because I have a very good exercise regimen I exercise about four to five times a week for at least an hour. It's my way of coping with coven.  

18:02:06 Participant: And I'm glad that you found a very productive and healthy way to do that.  
18:02:11 Coach: And then, you know, not wanting to get back up, Mike, want to keep my glucose levels down. So it's just kind of those things.

18:02:22 Participant: daily food intake is pretty. I don't know, like, so for morning I usually have a bowl of oatmeal, with peanut butter in it. And then for lunch. I will have usually like a can of tuna with crackers. And I'll have a snack so that's usually a piece of fruit or fruit, yogurt dairy free because I'm lactose sensitive. And then, and then for dinner. That's when I usually kind of kind of have whatever I've cooked for that night, and then sometimes take out a lot of times, take out. So, trying to figure out a good balanced diet, I think, is what my main goal is with this, and also maybe hopefully starting to meditate a lot more because my stress levels are really really high.  

18:03:21 Coach: I mean there's a lot of things going on right now so I think you still finding time to exercise, it's a very good way to maintain a proper like glucose level I was going to help you a lot to keep those glucose levels down, but I think you mentioned another great point which is the food, the food intake will also affect it. So having balanced meals as you mentioned having like enough for breakfast enough for lunch and enough for dinner. It's really going to keep it consistent because you don't want those like spikes right and your glucose think that that you brought up to this stress. Stress can also affect your glucose levels, and I think you're very aware of that.So I think you you bring up a really good point in focusing on managing stress because it can also help you to manage your, your glucose levels. So, okay, so we have a few a few areas that that we can can work on for you. So I'm thinking about, because I mentioned a little bit about stress and managing stress, and this last week, how would you rate your stress on a scale of zero of one to 10, one being not stress and 10 being very stressed.  
18:04:46 Participant: The list of seven, at least six out of eight, maybe more. Probably an eight, and there's a lot going on. Yeah, you know, and I'm in the law school. And so, it's just very competitive, and I feel very behind and so I've been playing catch up.  

18:05:07 Coach: So, you are feeling like I need to play catch up.  

18:05:14 Participant: Yeah. Being a student will add an extra, a little extra stress to your life. 
 
18:05:22 Coach: So I'm thinking about this upcoming week because one of the points of our meetings, is to, to help you set up goals but we want to do it in a very strategic way so we're going to be using the SMART goal acronym, so setting specific goals measurable goals attainable. Some there there need to be relevant and also time sensitive so for example we are meeting Wednesday at six. So my goal would be that we can meet every Wednesday at six if that works for you. And then that way we can check in on a weekly basis about how was your goal from the previous week, and also what will be your goal for the following week, how does that sound.  
18:06:22 Participant: Yeah, perfect. So in thinking about this first week, you mentioned a few things you mentioned food intake, something that you want to work on but you also mentioned meditation for stress management. Is there one thing that you want to start with for this week, or do you want to start next week, or do you want to do a SMART goal for at least one to four, for those two. What are you would like to start with the food stuff first.  

18:06:24 Coach: Okay, sounds good.  

18:06:38 Participant: So what would be a specific goal around food that you would want to set. Are you thinking more about adding fruits and vegetables to your meal.  

18:06:50 Coach: Yeah, yeah I think so because I feel like my calorie intake is fine. It's just not very balanced. So, I think incorporating more servings of fruits and vegetables would be good.  

18:07:07 Participant: So one of the things I heard when you are doing your food recall was that in the morning you have oatmeal yet peanut butter with that, but I didn't hear a fruit, so is, is this, is that something that you could think about adding maybe some type of fruit.  
18:07:23 Coach: I've thought of blueberries before, it's just so expensive. And those are the types of foods that you have to use rather quickly or they go really fast.  

18:07:37 Participant: I'll give you a little tip. I love blueberries. And I usually wash them right away and I freeze them, and they're not I mean they don't have the same taste as when they're fresh, but rhat way they'll last me a little bit longer. So just as a, as a suggestion or side note, but can you think of another fruit that you would want to try, if berries are not an option. 
 
18:08:01 Coach: Um, we have added bananas before to my oatmeal, good, bananas, apples are really good and oatmeal too I put a lot of stuff and oatmeal is my go to breakfast.  

18:08:11 Participant: Yeah.  

18:08:13 Coach: And it's fast and you can make it rather quickly. So I think you have an idea of the different types of berries that you could add you could add, bananas, you could add apples, or berries. So would that be a pretty good goal that you think would be a tool for this week. Yeah.  

18:08:34 Participant: So we'll be adding fruit to my breakfast.  

18:08:42 Coach: And how many days this week, or this upcoming week  

18:08:49 Participant: At least five because have oatmeal five days a week.  

18:09:07 Coach: And I sent what I thought it was going to come out as a graphic but I noticed that it came out as well as a landing have to click on it, so it on there, it had a few examples but I think the only example I gave you was actually for Apple which you had already brought up. But what I'll do is I'll find another source that has more information about fruits themselves and the serving size per different fruits, and I'll send that over to you.  

18:09:43 Participant: So in thinking about your goal, which we mentioned is going to be adding fruits to your practice, five days of the week. How confident, do you feel about being able to do that on a scale of one not confident to 10 very confident, 10, that's easy enough.  

18:10:04 Coach: Adding more vegetables I think would be harder.  

18:10:07 Participant: We can get to that next week.  

18:10:12 Coach: Yeah, I have to agree vegetables are. I like vegetables, I always try to have a serving of vegetables with dinner is just you know I keep buying baby carrots to have like as a snack and they always go bad and I never touch on them. And I think sometimes we forget the things that we buy too. And so, it's in some of the things required a little bit of prep work so preparing them into a way that it's going to make them look visible attractive wanting me to eat that. Because if I just buy it and put it in the fridge but never opened that door again.  It's just going to go bad  

18:10:58 Participant: You can try setting little reminders, eat those carrots. But you're not buying them anymore?  

18:11:04 Coach: I have a lot of digestion issues so if during this time, you could find foods for me to eat that will lower inflammation, aside from like the ones people always say like turmeric and ginger and stuff. Just things that'll be easier for me to digest because I do have pretty sure have ideas but an undiagnosed I need to see a doctor. But I do have a lot of digestion issues and with vegetables I do notice that was certainly, especially really fibrous ones. I do get upset stomach from that.  

18:11:41 Participant: Okay. Yeah, I can do that, I can look at some resources for, I'm thinking I'm just like thinking in my mind about like vegetables that are recommended if you do have like sensitivity, or like stomach sensitivities to food. I'm going to specifically look for like in the area, or IBS. Since you're thinking that that might be the cause, because I might give us I mean, yeah, but it's a good place to start because if, if you want to try some of that and if you notice a difference that you know okay maybe this is something that I need to focus on a little bit of.And there are just like fruits, there are some vegetables that are more starchy or than others. So I think that's something to consider. Maybe less starchy vegetables. So we have one goal for the week. That's very good.  Is there anything else that you want to discuss any other goals that you would want to set for the week.  

18:12:55 Coach: I don't think so.  

18:12:59 Participant: Okay. So in thinking about health goals what are some of the successes that you've had in the past with your health goals.  

18:13:20 Coach: Um, you heard that exercise was really big for me getting on a consistent kind of fitness plan, incorporating that and being able to get my glucose down that was a very big win for me. Food on the other hand, I've always struggled with. I've gotten into the habit of working out. it's, I have I have that habit pretty locked down and I go for walks too so I take as I have been done, and so I have to take my dog for a walk, because she has to go to the bathroom and I'm in an apartment.So, I work out five days a week four to five days a week, and I go for a daily walks with my dog so I'm pretty active, considering I'm stuck at home all day every day. It's the food that I think that I'm really lacking as far as having a better balanced diet. I take a multivitamin and if I can get those vitamins through diet rather than taking a multivitamin I'd rather get those vitamins through diet.  

18:14:23 Participant: Yes, and that makes perfect sense. And I will definitely come with as you mentioned with adding more variety to your meals. And so adding fruit because fruit and vegetables definitely have a lot of vitamins and minerals that are very essential for, like body function.  

18:14:40 Coach: So thinking about increasing fruits and vegetables I think will be a good start. But we'll start with the fruit,  

18:14:58 Participant: I don't have any more questions for you. Session one is starting to set goals, what we'll do in our following session will be a check in about how you did and also set up a goal for the following week so every week you'll have an opportunity to make a goal. 
 
18:15:18 Coach: I'll also keep asking you about the messages and what you thought about the messages, because we definitely want to make sure that we get feedback about whether those are helping you are motivating you in any sort of way. So we hope that they do. But let me know if there's anything else. My goal is to send you a summary of your goal today, I'll send that to you via email. And then I will send you a calendar invite for our next session which will be on trying to think of the days of the week, and let's pull up the calendar really quick. That will be the 14th, the 14th, at 6pm, so is 6pm, a good time for the rest of April. On Wednesdays, or what or do you want me to just set up the next one and then next week we'll check in for the following session.  

18:16:19 Participant: Um, yeah let's just set up next week and then see how it goes. Okay, sounds good.  

18:16:26 Coach: Great, thinking I do get your messages on the text, or your text messages too, feel free to respond or if you have any questions, and I'll do my best to answer those.
  
18:16:56 Participant: Cool. Thank you.  

18:16:54 Coach: Oh, it was very good to meet you. Jasmine. Have a great rest of your day, great rest of the week and I'll see you next Wednesday.
