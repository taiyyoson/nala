19:00:13 Coach: How are you today?

19:00:14 Participant: I'm doing good how are you.

19:00:17 Coach: Good, I'm glad that it's Wednesday.

19:00:19 Participant: Yeah.

19:00:21 Coach: For a moment I felt that it was Monday. I still feel there's a lot of things to get done this week. You know, one day at a time where. But how how are you doing today. What are you hoping to check in about today how goals from last week.

19:00:47 Participant: Yeah, so I did, I actually did pretty good. I completed all my goals for last, from last week, I thought I wasn't going to do the mindfulness one but the sleep, sleeping one meditate, meditate me. Yeah. And I didn't do like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday but I did do it three times at least.

19:01:06 Coach: Yeah, and that was your goal to do it. I want to say, three times. Yeah, you mentioned three times. Yeah, you had mentioned specific days but, I mean, it's flexible right you said three times so you just adjusted the time the day since that yeah you said three times this week.

19:01:30 Participant: Yeah.

19:01:32 Coach: So, and on a scale of one to 10. How did you do in meeting your goals?

19:01:42 Participant: I think it was a 10, I met, I would say I met all my goals.

19:01:49 Coach: Perfect. Yeah. Congratulations. Being here. And what were, what were the. What were some of the successes that you had with your goals. What were some of the challenges.

19:02:04 Participant: So I know I had, um, women's health appointments, already scheduled. And that was something that I mean it was already scheduled it was a matter of attending. So I just, I don't know, maybe I don't know about you but I just don't like those appointments, like, I don't know I have like a hard time like with the check, check in, I don't know I just don't like the woman's, like, you know, whatever the women's health appointments. And so, I can tell just by the way you're talking about it and I'll tell you, I love it because it tells me everything's okay down there, and everything looks good. Yeah, yeah. It's a little different, and it's okay, though, is that you're doing right yeah so, um, but it got done. And, you know, I'm pretty I'm pretty glad that I went and, you know, everything was everything was good. So, and then I think scheduling the doctor's appointment that one actually was very easy because they had availability for like the next day, because I think I was supposed to do by Friday. So, they had availability for for Saturday. So that was very easy for me to do and it was like really fast too. I requested them to be mailed. I actually have to check my mail for that I haven't checked.

19:03:44 Coach: Ah, so I mean your goal was to set up the appointment but you actually went to do the appointment itself. Yeah. So then, yeah, got the appointment on. And so that one would have went above and beyond for that one yes congratulate that's that one is no sometimes can be tricky right because you want to set something up but they don't have availability until three weeks from now. Yeah. Good, good. And the meditation.

19:04:10 Participant: That one. I didn't, I remember last time you asked the confidence level and I didn't have much confidence, but I feel good that I was able to do it I got my family in on it too I think it helped that I like had it Where did it with my with my parents and my sisters, kind of well together. So that helped a lot. I think that was like that. Last one.

19:04:43 Coach: Do you feel that doing it as a family help.

19:04:47 Participant: Yeah. And they helped, I kind of like downloaded the headspace app for my mom too, because I know that it's hard for her to kind of sleep too so it was kind of like killing two birds with one stone.

19:05:09 Coach: It's wonderful to hear that you had a lot of success this week. That's very good. So as you're, you're thinking about. Actually let me before we go to that. Let me ask you about stress so how was your stress this last week on a scale of one to 10.

19:05:33 Participant: Um, I would say. it was probably like a six find. Yeah, wasn't too bad.

19:05:42 Coach: And when you. Wait, did you find that there were some things that were helping so that it wasn't such a stressful week and what were some of those things that helped you this week.

19:05:57 Participant: Um, I think. I think because I am visiting my parents, and every time I visit my parents, I really have a. I don't know a good time, it kind of disconnect from from because they live out of town, so I feel like I mean physically I disconnect from my life. It could be a stressor but this time it wasn't because my sister's here. My grandma. I got to see her this weekend too. So I think if it wasn't, you know, I think the last time it was stressful because of her my grandma's health was declining but this time I was kind of like being able to see that she's still doing pretty ok helped a lot, kind of keep my mouth and. Yeah. Overall, and work too I think that I think it really always depends on those two like family and work stuff, and work was pretty, there wasn't a lot of crises that came up.

19:07:09 Coach: And what are some things that you want to check in about today. You did all your other goals.

19:07:17 Participant: Um, so like new goals. Right.

19:07:22 Coach: Yeah.

19:07:22 Participant: Um, I would say. Meditation like still try to do that one. I don't know maybe like four times a week. We can try I can try that one, or No.

19:07:43 Coach: Yes, whatever you want so I know last time you because last time you said three times. And I think we were doing, 10 minutes with it. Yes. So you want to continue with 10 minutes. And last time you were doing three days of the week now you want to do four.

19:08:08 Participant: Yes.

19:08:08 Coach: And remind me. Are you going to be doing this at night or morning, afternoon, and night time.

19:08:19 Coach: Yeah, you can. If, if that is something that is helping you and you want to continue to do that i think that that's a great idea. And how confident, do you feel about being able to do so.

19:08:33 Participant: I'll go with a still fine.

19:08:33 Coach: And what are some things that you'll do to remember to do it.

19:08:46 Participant: the notifications actually didn't help. So, I'm not really sure what did help this last week, you mentioned, including your family helped me get something that you continue to do realistically, or is there something else that maybe setting it on your calendar like a calendar invite that can remind you, Hey, I think you're including family and I think what helped me is just kind of my own like with me doing it for myself, kind of like no, you need to sleep be like kind of thinking about the next day like you don't want to wake up all you know like stop getting stopping on your phone or stop doing your work now or, I don't know when thinking about the potential benefits.

19:09:45 Coach: Right. Right. Yes. And that's really positive thinking when you think about it, it's thinking about this activity as a positive activity that's going to help you achieve your, your goal which is to get enough rest so that you feel enough energy throughout the day and you're very confident about being able to do it and as a good confidence. Isn't that another goal that you want to include for this week or you want to just start with that one for now.

19:10:24 Participant: Um, I can. I would like to include more of like a healthy eating meal prep kind of thing. I'm just kind of like I don't know where to start with that one maybe like.

19:10:44 Coach: I know, when you say healthy eating. Do you want to, and because you said two things you said a few things you said I want to focus on healthy eating and do meal prepping but I'm not sure where to start. So do you want to do meal prepping, and for that does that mean cook a certain meal for a specific day of the week, or let's say, spend X amount of time on Sundays meal prepping for the rest of the week, or does it mean because healthy eating can mean a lot of different things right. More than just meal prepping, it can be well right now I noticed I'm not eating any fruits and vegetables, and I want to include fruits and vegetables in my meals.

19:11:40 Participant: of fruits and vegetables and for a specific meal of the day. How many days. So what are you what are you, you're thinking about that. Yeah. So, um, yeah. Definitely, yeah I see how those are two different ones. So the healthy eating veggies and fruits, because I don't like Ali fruit. I love fruit, but I'm not really eating veggies, with my meals. And so it's a lot of like carbs or protein but not even trees, and then include fruits and vegetables in your meals.

19:12:04 Coach: And you mentioned, you typically are able to have fruit. And is there an amount of servings that you want to focus on for for either or both.

19:12:26 Participant: So, probably veggies. Um, I just feel like I'm trying to think of like the SMART goals and what's realistic for me.

19:12:43 Coach: So I think, for example, and let's, let's do an example let's say for for dinner. What do you typically have for dinner. And can you add a serving of a vegetable to your dinner. Yeah, and you don't even have, you don't have to say I'm going to eat five servings of vegetables for dinner. No, no, it can be. Right now I'm not eating any and I know that. So I'll start with one serving of vegetables, and a serving of vegetables could, it depends on the certain type of vegetable Do you have vegetables in mine.

19:13:16 Participant: Yeah I have like the have squash, carrots, bell peppers.

19:13:16 Coach: Yeah. And for most vegetables if it's cooked the serving will be like half a cup. One serving will be half cup, but if it's raw, a serving is actually. So, that gives you any.

19:13:38 Participant: Okay. Okay. Yeah, so I think I'll do I'll start with the veggies because I know fruits are not no problem. So I'll include one serving of cooked veggies. For dinner.

19:14:03 Coach: Okay, yes. And what I have to say like how, like, like, how many times a week or for like the whole, like, Okay, how many, how many days this week. I mean, do you have dinner every day, but hey, maybe you want to do it three days, maybe you want to do it two days maybe you want to do it four days, or what's realistic.

19:14:30 Participant: Okay, I'll do five. My confidence about completing it it's a little bit higher this way.

19:14:37 Coach: Okay. And what would be your confidence level.

19:14:44 Participant: I will say a seven as well. 

19:14:49 Coach: Okay. I like how you're getting this yes if my confidence. Low it means not likely to happen and then we can we can work with that we can work. Yeah. And what are some things that you can do to remember to do this. and how, how can you hold yourself accountable to do it.

19:15:10 Participant: So, probably the potential benefits. thinking about about that and then also I think the meal prepping to kind of the meal prepping because it kind of making it, making it a part of it. Because I'm actually a usually meal prep at the beginning of the week, well this is before meal prep at the beginning of the week, and kind of have a dish in mind and like including that versus trying to scrape up something or, you know, do something that day of and not be prepared, making it part of meal prepping.

19:15:48 Coach: And yeah, and I think you make an excellent point. Yes, at times, in order for this to happen, we do, we do, there's some back and work that needs to take place, like we need to think ahead of time. Do I even have vegetables that I can actually use. So I might even take you back as when you're doing your list of groceries that you're going to buy or, or whoever's going to go by you slip in some. Hey, all right, you know. So that's two goals, did you have another one in my, or I think those are two good ones too.

19:16:37 Participant: I think, yeah. I don't want you to feel too Oh, yeah, maybe we'll keep it will keep it like that and see how it go like, yeah it'll be kind of a ripple effect of, it'll help me do some other other things that maybe can come up next time.

19:17:06 Coach: We have two more sessions. There's definitely time does fly by. I ready to say like, we're almost going to be done so we're halfway there, like halfway. So we have our goal number one which is around meditation, and then Goal number two which will be about, including vegetables and dinner, specifically, right.

19:17:33 Participant: Yes.

19:17:42 Coach: And from the messages that you receive this week for the text messages. Are there any messages that stood out to you.

19:17:52 Participant: I'm like, I'm like, trying to go look back. Now we send one daily and sometimes it's difficult to keep track, there was, there was a, an image, it wasn't really let me see, there was an image that was sent out, is today's for the active one. What I really do appreciate the Spanish, because some of them have, you know, have like Spanish in there. So I really appreciate that a lot. And I also like that, the image, though, that it really like, I don't know, it's like a brown woman who's not fair, and I you know I don't know it's just, I kind of like resemble more or like this more inclusive. You know I don't, I don't know if that makes sense but.

19:18:43 Coach: So, It makes perfect. This was done with purpose. This was done by nothing as we understand that all Latinas look different and we wanted to make sure that that came across.

19:18:57 Participant: Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I really did appreciate that one.

19:19:09 Coach: We did. We're getting quite a bit of feedback on images and how the photos are very attractive and they like the images. I think the text is not as. Okay. That's why we do both right there was a text though the, I think I reply to you. You were asking about what did it do for your spiritual, what did you do for your spirituality, set aside some time to kind of meditate yoga stuff like that. And I replied that I was like in the patio.

19:19:32 Participant: I really like some of those questions because sometimes I don't respond but I it does get me to thinking like, kind of, actually, you know, kind of answer them and reflect on what have I done. So that's how my mom I did answer you. That was, I had breakfast in my patio. So I really, I like those two. I know it's like not just the images but you know it does bring some sort of awareness to reflection.

19:20:16 Coach: Yes, I'm glad I'm glad. And I mean some of the questions are some of the messages is asking you a question. And it is for that purpose to make you think about it, if you feel like responding. We love responses because then I get excited, I get a response and then I can respond back. But if you don't have time, we can talk about it. When we meet, which also another opportunity to do it.

19:20:42 Participant: Right, right. But yes, I really like your message when you told me what you are doing and I know she's doing like that. Oh my god. Yeah, it just lets me no more that's all I can say. I like we like knowing.

19:20:58 Coach: Yeah, that's great, Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing. And I hope that the messages that are coming up because you're still going to continue to get messages. I hope they inspire you, and in similar ways to to stay grounded to stay motivated and to find new ways to do things, I think that's, that's really our, our purpose for this program to any other items that you want to bring up today, any challenges that that you had or any successes that you want to share.

19:21:41 Participant: We went over some of those. Um, yeah so when I got my lab work I last time I had mentioned that I that's kind of like my starting point to see where I'm at. So when I got my lab work. I got you know my like overall results back and talk to my doctor about things. And I also asked to get enrolled into one of the their classes that they have to learn more about, you know, health and wellness. So, I had it scheduled for today but I didn't realize it was like a long, like a long class, like a two hour class, and so I'm like okay why don't really have time I have, I have homework to do so I rescheduled it. I don't feel too good I'm like maybe I should have taken it but you know what i rescheduled it's rescheduled slots. I want it's more of like I just didn't have that time. But I think that intention was still, you know, it's still kind of still wanting to learn more about a more conscious about it I'm not really like fearful fearful but just I think that's maybe the biggest thing for me that I, I don't really go to the, I don't know, you know, as you probably saw early Anna like one of the doctors or, I don't know. And so it's like no I want, I want to understand what's, let's talk about it. Let's see how I can, you know, learn more about anything.

19:23:20 Coach: When do you feel that you started noticing that that you just don't feel comfortable going to the doctor or that it wasn't really like something that you enjoy to me.

19:23:31 Participant: Probably, honestly, it's probably just been my, my whole life. Like I, I, it's like I don't drive it. It's just that. I don't know, I just, yeah. I don't accountable, I don't know, I guess what I wonder is.

19:23:54 Coach: Is it the idea of going to someone else to potentially tell you something that you don't want to hear, or is it the idea that, like you feel fine. You don't really want to know if you don't have to know or have you had like bad experiences with providers.

19:24:14 Participant: Um, I think it's, it's a little bit of of the now wanting to know especially with women's health, I think like you know with with my with my period like it's always been been very regular. I think I personally have my own doubts about like fertility and I think for me it's like, like that topic for me as a little like. Since, like, it's like sensitive. And I want to know, but I also don't want to like ask about, like, that part of. And I actually didn't ask, you know, I kind of got the full, you know like STD testing you know whatever all that and you know annual stuff I need to get done. pap smear yeah all that stuff. And, you know, I, it's something that I didn't really ask or touch on, and I thought about it after two hours like maybe I shut up and I'm like doing like I just, I don't know.

19:25:24 Coach: I think with with doctors and just with our health. And it's, it can be very specific very personal subject right very personal. We're letting someone into our personal space, and see us in a way that we're very vulnerable and literally make it right. So it's, it's. Now how do I say this. Yeah, it's just all there right and how and how do you get comfortable, like with that. I'm the, I'm a believer in prevention. I'm all for preventative services, and the importance of detection early on. So, even if, like, especially if you know there's something in your family that that there's like a genetic predisposition for something, then it is definitely important to do all of that and just know so if something gets caught early then you have time to figure out what happens next. There's a, there's, it's more likely for something to be treated retrievable if it's corporately on. So I would say, just like when you think positive about like meditation, you know, kind of throw in some positive thoughts come to the doctor, and hopefully that will eat some of that, like hesitation.

19:26:52 Participant: Yeah. I feel like that's definitely me cuz I'm a case manager like I work with, with my clients like of mental health and stuff and I'm like, all about, you know, linking them like going to your doctor and you know all airy, kind of your get a balanced overall well being of yourself and I know that's probably sometime not something I need I need to personally work on, like, with physical health, because it's something that I feel, I probably been neglecting to like just overall. Yeah, and then just the uncomfortableness to have like, like you mentioned like literally being like me getting that it's just I, I'm just not, I don't know, I just, I tell you something that I think of every single time. And I'm like, it's not such a big deal. Imagine how many people they've seen all day, imagine like like imagine how many vaginas they've seen. I don't think mine is going to make an impression of any kind, at this point, That's that's actually what got me through that. I was just kind of like okay you know I just need to do it and I was just so tense but only to do like it just takes a lot for me to just even make that appointment like I've literally had gone on the app on you know on the kp.org and like literally have like looked at appointments and then I'll just be like okay now and it just took a lot for me Yeah, you need to work on it. No, you didn't need it. I know.

19:28:34 Coach: And let's celebrate that you did. Yeah. That's very good. One or the other, not that you mentioned something about after you left you realize maybe you should have asked something. One of the things that that I found really useful is before I even go to an appointment, I make a little list of like concerns that I might have, or things I want to know about that way I have it in writing in a more likely to ask. And not forget about.

19:29:06 Participant: Just. I did that, and I had that in there and i didn't i don't know I think it's that fear of a kind of know but I don't want to know. Yeah. Yeah. But I know I have to do it eventually and like I thought about possibly like doing another appointment or just emailing because I already you know have her daughters.

19:29:29 Coach: Yeah. You know it's a good way to ask questions without having to be directly like face to face and my make that question, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. And definitely find providers that you feel comfortable with, I would say that my other point about providers providers can make you feel uncomfortable. And that's, yeah.

19:29:59 Participant: No, I was assigned to a. I have I have nothing against white males were assigned to a white male obgyn, like, I don't actually even know how that happened. Like, I just got a letter saying hey you know this is your person and I was like, Oh no, like I don't think I can do a man at all like I'm already this. Then I just I changed. I changed my doctor to someone that I felt was more comfortable and, you know, and the experience was great.

19:30:37 Coach: I think in this day and age, there should be enough female obgyns that we should be able to choose a female provider.

19:30:47 Participant: Yeah. Yes. I don't think I ever had a male, because I don't like what do you have to do them there. Nothing. Right. And I mean he was, he was young nq and stuff and I'm like, Oh no, like okay I don't know no that's not gonna work out. I'm just I'm glad I just was like, whoo. I'm glad even though there was that part that I feel like I yeah, that's the only part of it but I'm like, you know, Got my levels down and got my results.

19:31:37 Coach: Well I'm glad that you're able to do that. And now, we have some, some time to process. And now, figure out where do you want to go. Now that you have your baseline. And for the class that you signed up, I would say, Don't feel bad about rescheduling just look at your schedule when do you have a good amount of time for what it requires so that you're fully present and fully engaged for it, too.

19:32:05 Participant: Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's what they just didn't. It was a lot and usually Wednesdays. When Wednesday nights I also get my work, my homework done because I have class tomorrow. I don't have time to get anything done because I work. So I'm like no you know I think I, you know, and there's, there's always there was times to reschedule so I'm like, that's fine and I already had gotten a lot of information from my doctor and so, like, on the email so.

19:32:37 Coach: Yeah. Well I would say you have two very good goals for this week. I will send you a summary of what we have the goal that you've set up for today. I'll add a few resources about vegetables and we know, give you ideas. And we'll check in next Wednesday at seven. And we'll go from there.

19:33:02 Participant: Right. Okay, Yes.

19:33:04 Coach: And I think next Wednesday will decide about session, or, or do you have an idea now more or less because I know you have plans for the fifth so we could either meet before or after. So either that Tuesday or Thursday.

19:33:21 Participant: Tuesday. probably Tuesday, class. I have class Tuesday. Let's see. Yeah, we can be a Monday, the third.

19:33:54 Coach: So because Wednesdays, you can after what time. 

19:34:10 Participant: I can meet after, after five o'clock on on Wednesday. But did you have time. Earlier in the day because I could meet at noon on Wednesday. 

19:34:20 Coach: Are you free Thursday at noon.

19:34:36 Participant: Thursday at noon.

19:34:48 Coach: Okay, let's do Thursday at noon that way. I see me to do something before your class you're in.

19:35:01 Participant: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. So that will be the sixth. Okay. And that was. Yeah. Actually, I put in my two week notice for work today. So, in two weeks. On the fifth. We're having some people that live my co workers. Ex coworkers in. And so, I had re and also really like planned.

19:35:43 Coach: Where are you working right now.

19:35:48 Participant: I work at A. This program is called telecare Kaiser ICT it's again. It's an outpatient mental health program work for members.

19:36:03 Coach: Okay. Are you going to a new position.

19:36:06 Participant: So right now I'm actually going to take time off some since I'm starting traineeship in the summer, I about well I already have that but I'm starting until August, and, you know, for taking what three like a three month break. Because the, the overall like work. It's just a little. I feel like I need that break right now for myself and I'm going to be here, and also like at my kind of my parents house to kind of go back and forth between those those three months. Yeah. And then when I start that position I'm going to do something I'm going to be doing this. Basically, same thing community mental health. But within their organization. Yeah, other organization and as a clinician like a student clinician role.

19:37:08 Coach: Okay. Yeah. Well I'm excited for, for your new adventures. And also for making sure that you take a break and take care of yourself. I think that's that's important too.

19:37:22 Participant: Yeah, I know it was something I wasn't too sure about. But, you know, I'm going to be. I mean, depending on the pandemic. I also want to be in Mexico for a while to, you know, just kind of, I don't know, do what, just have fun like it's just bringing months it's. I've never done it live. Like I just feel like it you know what, because I've worked in community. Community Mental Health for, I don't know how many years now and I feel like I haven't really had a break, other than like maybe holiday one week off, things like that and you know just grad school and work like hearing, because I work with high intense members and, you know, like, a lot of like 5150 volts crises in and out of the EDS and then I'm also in grad school learning about trauma and it's like, oh my goodness like it's a lot right now so I'm hoping that those two months for me.

19:38:16 Coach: Yeah, you need to make sure that you also take care of your own mental health. Yeah, at any point.

19:38:30 Participant: Yeah, so.

19:38:33 Coach: Well, Thank you so much for sharing.
