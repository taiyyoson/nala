20:48:27 Participant: Just got your message.

20:48:29 Coach: Oh, that's okay. How are you?

20:48:31 Participant: I'm well, how are you?

20:48:33 Coach: Good. I know you have like a really busy day.

20:49:04 Coach: Yeah, I think my internet is bad though so I'm sorry.

20:49:09 Participant: Oh no, you're fine. It was mine.

20:49:17 Coach: But thanks for joining me. I know, I was just saying like I know you've had a busy day. So I appreciate you meeting me at this hour.

20:49:42 Participant: Yeah, no worries. I also appreciate you like accommodating for me, like, with my class and stuff so yeah, no worries. I hope your conversation with your professor went well.

20:49:50 Coach: I did, thank you. I have a project due for a Wednesday class, but because I'm teaching science I want her input. I'm in like her science class.

20:49:58 Participant: Yeah, but it's more of like how to modify a science lesson for English language learners. So, if I have a scene, which I have had like this happen on Wednesday, Monday. I taught my science lesson and this basically asked students like "what does a scientist look like to you," you know. My student who just immigrated from Mexico a few months ago had told me, had showed me a picture of himself saying like, "oh you know when I'm older I want my nose piercing, my lip pierced" so my mom told me when I'm 18 or 21 I can get piercings. So I had to tell him in Spanish like "oh no, global scientists in typical" but "what does the scientists look like." And then it was like, "oh okay I understand" you know. So it's like, what can I do better to help kids like ELL kids you know, not necessarily just Spanish you know I have students who speak Arabic. But how can I support these kids in the science classroom?

20:51:06 Coach: So thoughtful of you, and, like, that's like just a really good shift in the education system that could be useful and help a lot of people. And, yeah, I mean like my experience growing up was always like, you know, my mom dropped out in fourth grade and my dad like finished high school. Growing up I always felt like I couldn't do math or homework because I couldn't ask my parents for help. And that was... helping me it was always me yelling at them like "no like that's not the way we do it in school like you know like what the heck." And obviously like I grew up and I was like that's not okay. But it's like how do I prevent that. And how do I help students feel supported you know I don't want the students to feel lost in the classroom, you know, making them fall behind just because they don't speak English. Like, if they're in the US like I feel like they will have to understand it to a degree to do well and it's like, How can I support them in doing well in class.

20:52:25 Participant: Sorry, I missed a little bit of what you said.

20:52:29 Coach: Hey, no worries, bad internet. But yeah, I think great work all around and I'm excited to know that you're, or that teachers are thinking in this way. So, for today's health session. This is our second one. So what, how did your health goal go for this last week?

20:53:02 Participant: I didn't go to the store on Sunday so I didn't have like fruits or vegetables. I only had like one banana here. I did eat cereal this week until like my roommate was like "all the cereals you are eating have like hella sugar" and then she gave me like, whole wheat Cheerios that she recommended. I ate out, but it was more of like, not like burgers or anything like that. It was more like I had tacos today. I had curry two days ago. I worked out today as well. I took my dog on a walk, twice so far this week.

20:53:58 Coach: So, on a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did in meeting your health goals?

20:54:04 Participant: I think it was a five, mostly because this week was like super busy. I had to take like two tests, and then Tuesdays and Thursdays are my longest days. I have math homework I'm about to do. So definitely a five because I feel like I barely got there, but I could have done more. So I definitely want to go to the store tomorrow when I have more time to like, buy things. I don't have an excuse this weekend.

20:54:48 Coach: So, before we transition to your goal for this week, which it could be the same goal, I just have a couple questions. One about your stress. On a scale of one to 10, what was your stress level this week?

20:54:58 Participant: I don't think it was necessarily stress. I was just talking to someone about this because I have chemistry last quarter. I feel like my stress level was like... That's funny. I had so much to do but my stuff got done. I feel like if you have, at least for me, like if you have a deadline but you have so much to do like you'll do it if you can. Now I feel like I have deadlines, but so much more free time on Mondays and Wednesdays that I'm kind of like, "I'll do it later." So I feel like my stress level was like a six or seven.

20:55:35 Coach: That's still relatively high, like baseline, but it's better than a 20 so I'm gonna give a thumbs up there. Are there any messages that stood out to you that motivated you that you liked, specifically?

20:55:59 Participant: I think I got sad because in one of them you asked me a question and I didn't reply, because I was like "wait, I can't reply" because I had to take a test. And then I was like "shit like now I feel bad and now it's like half the day later."

20:56:19 Coach: Yeah, that one was just like a check in question. Don't feel obligated to respond. I know you're like so busy and you have a lot of things to manage. So, if you respond cool and if you don't like, no worries. I won't take it personally. But aside from the check in message, are there any other messages that, like the ones that come in at like 9:30?

20:56:54 Participant: I think the most important one was like, understanding the why behind it. I feel like most times people are kind of like, at least to me it's like "whatever like, I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow." But in getting to know the why it's like "all right I'm just gonna do it now and get it over with" or like "this is my goal, this is what I want to accomplish, it's like why are you doing this." So, I liked that one because it makes you, it made me think. And then also that's like what pushed me to like exercise today. I worked out, it's like "what's my goal." All right, well it's not just going to happen overnight and like I have to do the work. And why is also like what makes me want to get up and like go outside and do homework outside, you know, when you text me at nine I'm like... at 10, I'm outside doing my homework already and like in lecture. Because, being in bed all day like I'm just gonna wish my day away and like... nah, now I know.

20:57:54 Coach: Thank you. Any other comments on the text messages?

20:58:00 Participant: I liked that one of them included a picture, but also it didn't just tell me like "you should exercise my god" so it gave you like a goal of like 30 minutes or something. It was like "for you to be healthy, you should go outside and like work out" or like "just walk around for like 30 minutes," which is nice because it's like you could make 30 minutes, you know you could do it during lunch, you could do it during your break or something, you could maybe split that up between like 10, 10 and 10.

20:58:36 Coach: Yeah, so it wasn't necessarily like directive like "get outside" but more like informative. And then, like you were... I like how you took it to the next level of like, "I have 30 minutes, 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there." So that was really creative. Thank you. So those are kind of like the standard questions I have so I appreciate your patience there. What were you hoping to talk about or check in about today?

20:59:11 Participant: Honestly, I thought of it as more of like "what do you need from me" like, "what kind of information do you want to get or what do you want to accomplish," not necessarily like, "oh, today I want to..." or "today I want to talk about like what my next week goal is," you know. I feel like I know my goals and I want to do better next week. So...

20:59:38 Coach: Yeah, so I'm sorry but I gotta throw it back to you. What, tell me about the goals that you have for yourself.

20:59:50 Participant: I definitely want to go on a walk during my lunch, or after I teach math which is around three. So I definitely want to walk my dog. I have this app called Plant Nanny that reminds me to drink water. Plant Nanny. Yeah, I just got another notification right now at nine. Basically you get a plant, and you drinking water and you marking that you drink water is you giving that plant water. If you don't drink your water every hour or whatever and you don't water your plant, your plant's gonna die. So if you want it to live, you should be drinking water.

21:00:39 Coach: Okay, so you have some water goals.

21:00:48 Participant: And I can show you my plant right now. And it's all... Oh, do you get to pick the plant?

21:00:59 Coach: Yeah you do get to pick the plant. There's like this button called "water of life" that you could like also bring them back to life. But if you click on it like your plant dies, like, just straight to the point. You could plant a new one.

21:01:18 Participant: So I have that but I never drink water. Like I don't like... I feel like I'm one of the few people who don't like the taste of water. It doesn't taste like anything to me. Like I'd choose lemonade over soda, but I definitely want to drink more water. I'm gonna walk, eat two fruits or vegetables a day. So I want to go buy carrots and stuff. My roommate whenever she's been over she will make like a chicken Caesar salad with like chicken and stuff. And it's like super healthy and I ate it without hating it.

21:02:05 Coach: So you have three really good specific goals. And so I'm just going to like write them in like the SMART goal format, and then go from there. So, what the walking goal. In the next week you will go for... how long do you want to walk for? Like, what's your ideal walk time?

21:02:32 Participant: I feel like that's tricky. I always have the same route and I feel like it takes me like maybe 10 minutes. I definitely want to do more. I just always take my dog. I don't know, I'm hoping 30 minutes, you know like, even if it's like breaking it up. Maybe I could do like 15 during lunch and then 15 at three.

21:02:56 Coach: Okay, so go for two 15 minute walks, and then during the day. And once at lunch and once... What did you say after? At 3pm.

21:03:29 Participant: After I teach math or science.

21:03:33 Coach: Does your lunch hour stay consistent?

21:03:36 Participant: Yes, it's always from 12 to one.

21:03:47 Coach: Do you want this to be a goal, just Monday through Friday, or do you want to include the weekends?

21:03:56 Participant: I think Monday through Friday. I definitely could do the weekend like if I go hiking and stuff. But I haven't gone out like that recently. I'll wait until after the semester to.

21:04:12 Coach: Okay. So, in the next week you will go for two 15 minute walks during the day. Once at 12, and once at 3, Monday through Friday. And then for you, what's like the... what's your why for this goal? Why is this important to you?

21:04:48 Participant: I gained weight like during quarantine and that was okay with it, but I feel like it's too much so I want to be healthier. But also like I just hate being in my room like I hate being in my room. Like Zoom calls are here at home, I'm like not enjoying my day you know like I... not necessarily want to go see people but like I want to be outside of the house, walking around and like actually like seeing people, not necessarily visiting someone you know, like, I want to interact with something or someone you know. If I take my dog on a walk, she like barks at other dogs because she's horrible, she's not trained. So like, it's something, there's something there. I always get yelled at for that. I got my dog my senior year of high school and then I just left it was my mom, until I came back from college. So I never trained her specifically. She just barks at everyone, and if you take her to a dog park, she will not like make friends, she will sit next to you.

21:06:03 Coach: Oh, yes I know she hates everything. She hates everything. She's like if you think of a grumpy old lady yelling at people. That's her. She will like sit next to me and if a dog approaches who wants to say hi to her...

21:06:18 Participant: I got a dog. She's a poodle mix thing that I just randomly got. It's horrible. I randomly just got her in high school. My friend was selling puppies. And I was like, "oh, like I want the puppy." And this is her after I gave her a haircut. I gave her a photoshoot putting flowers on the floor.

21:06:53 Coach: What's her name?

21:06:55 Participant: Chiquita, Chiquita. Chiquita with an attitude. But yeah, I usually when I take her out... That's like my girl, my dog. She's like super super fluffy when you don't cut her fur. Oh wow, yeah she looks like a whole different animal. But I take her out and she like sees a dog and wants to like go after them. Like not to bite them but she just wants to bark. I take her everywhere with me whenever I can. So that's her but then I have my other dog who is super duper trained. I was just showing my dad a video earlier about my dog. This is the dog that my parents got, like three years ago. And so I was here with him. I've been here with him. He's like, trained like... you know, sit down, rollover, leave it, wait, leave. Oh, Taco. And so, like, I gave her, I gave her food to Chiquita, she didn't... you know, it's not good enough for me. She's like "is it organic meat, is it not from a five star restaurant?" And so I just gave it to Taco, the big dog. But he also could get aggressive where I don't take them to a dog park. I don't walk him. The whole like 10, 15 minutes that I'm walking, his is more of like around the block and then we go home. Taco is going to be like, so bad. It's just walking around with... I never take them out the house without a muzzle like I just will not, you know, and my dad does. My dad will like walk them without a muzzle but he's just like horrible like he used to snap at me, he bit me once when he was younger and I had to like train him out of that you know. So, I just don't want to risk it. I took him to school as a puppy when I went to my job site when I worked at my job site, and a student went to approach him, and my dog like tried to bite them, and never again. I was like "no, I'm not taking you anywhere without a muzzle" like he might like try to like bite, not anything aggressively but I was like "no like I cannot put anyone else in danger."

21:10:11 Coach: I think that's a smart move and also... I mean, in our culture, we just like sue people left and right and so you just don't want to risk that. We have your first health goal down. I think, like, I'm excited about this one too because people who have set like these walking goals before have like a lot of like positivity the next week. They're like... so I'm excited to like, see how this goes for you. And then, so it's going to be five days Monday through Friday. Is there anything that I can do to like help you achieve this goal? For example, like, text messages or Google Calendar invites, anything like that?

21:11:17 Participant: I think the text messages help. My class runs from like 10 to 12:15. So it already cuts 15 minutes into like my lunch, making it like 45 minutes. And if I were to like walk at 12:15 that's like now my lunch is like 30 minutes and if I have to cook or whatever, you know... So what I try to do is cook, like make myself like some eggs in the morning or something, so that way I like don't have to cook for lunch. I could just go on the walk. But the messages definitely help. You're asking like "have you gone on a walk." Yeah. I don't want to lie to you and say, "Yeah, I did."

21:12:01 Coach: Cool. Yeah, I'll make sure to get those messages. And then so you technically are going to start tomorrow and then, up until next week. And then, on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

21:12:21 Participant: I think it's like an eight, eight or nine. I believe next week I'll have so much to do. And I'm super backed up because I got my second COVID shot... I got it over the weekend and so I like just fell asleep all Saturday and Sunday. And I like missed out on a lot of like homework time and studying time. Next week should be better.

21:12:46 Coach: How are you feeling from it?

21:12:54 Participant: I feel okay, I overslept today. I feel okay. I just got tired, I had Pfizer. And so my arm was sore for like the first two, three days. But I was just super super tired. My first shot I fell asleep for like three hours. This second shot, I was just tired the whole day like I fell asleep early. I woke up a little bit late. I didn't want to do anything and just stayed in bed but... But that's it. My friends got Moderna, and they said that the side effects are like horrible where they like, get chills and fevers. Yeah, apparently like someone called their doctor and I was like, "Oh yeah, that means your body's like getting used to it so you should be fine."

21:13:46 Coach: Yeah, it was mandatory bed rest for me and I was like, "I don't hate it." : So, feeling good about the first goal. The second goal was around water.

21:14:10 Participant: And that will revive my plant so when we meet on Thursday, my plant will be alive.

21:14:16 Coach: So in the next week you will... and then did you say eight cups of water?

21:14:21 Participant: I didn't say that but I could do that, yes. Or what makes sense to you? I think that works. I think that's what my plant needs so eight cups of water a day.

21:14:34 Coach: And then do you want to do it for all like seven days or five days?

21:14:41 Participant: I think for this one, I should aim for all seven days. Like even on weekends, drink a cup of water every day.

21:14:54 Coach: And then, so I guess one strategy is like drink one before every meal or during the meal.

21:15:03 Participant: Yeah, or like during the meal. So, drink water during the day.

21:15:18 Coach: Do you feel like you can easily track eight cups of water?

21:15:24 Participant: Yes.

21:15:29 Coach: Because this is a joke but like a little shot glass is not equal to one cup of water.

21:15:35 Participant: That's what I was going to use.

21:15:38 Coach: So making sure like it is a clear cup of water. And then for you, I mean, maybe it's as simple as keeping your plant alive, but why is drinking 8 cups of water every day important to you?

21:15:57 Participant: I think besides the fact that like, it helps you get healthy, it's also like hydrating you know like I feel like lately my skin has been super dry. I just... not like because of the heat because it's been cold lately. And then, also, like me not getting enough water, and it also helped me like get rid of sugar like from Coke, from sodas, from like lemonade. A few years ago, I started reaching for lemonade instead of Coke, even though like lemonade has more sugar as well. But I think this is a way to like, eliminate that, and I also drink coffee and coffee dehydrates you so you need water to balance it out.

21:16:40 Coach: Yeah. I know you mentioned like not being like the biggest fan of water. Have you tried like adding just plain lemon to water?

21:16:50 Participant: I have and I don't like it. I have done like cucumber and stuff or like other fruits, but I think it's also just like the time to go get whatever food I want to add and like not add it in my cup and like cutting it up, which sounds like a lot to me but it's honestly not.

21:17:09 Coach: Yeah, I know they have... People are so creative, there's like water bottles that like help you infuse your water with like... we don't need all that extra stuff, but the other suggestion I was thinking of is like making like a big batch of iced tea and like, with just no sugar, and so it would be tea flavored.

21:17:34 Participant: I don't drink tons of tea like I will not drink tea if I don't have to. Like if I'm not sick I won't drink tea. But there are like teas from Starbucks that I like.

21:18:06 Coach: So it might be like a lot of work to get to Starbucks and buy those teas so we can just stick to plain water. I don't know if there's anything that we can make it more enjoyable for you to deal with, which is fine. So, in the next week you will drink 8 cups of water every day. Is there anything that I can do to help you meet this goal?

21:18:41 Participant: No, I think this one's more of like me doing it because it's like water's right there. You know like water is right there for me to grab, I could drink it on my walk. I could take a water bottle with me while I go to the store or something you know, drink it in the car, like water is like super accessible so I have no reason not to do it.

21:19:10 Coach: And does the app, send you notifications like throughout the day?

21:19:16 Participant: Yeah, you could schedule your notifications to be like, every two hours or every hour or something.

21:19:28 Coach: So, what's your confidence level in meeting this health goal?

21:19:34 Participant: It's like a low six but I'm hoping to do it. It doesn't mean that like I don't want to, it just means like like to do, I have to do. But I'm confident that like once I get over the first two days I should be fine.

21:19:50 Coach: Okay, so your confidence may increase after two days?

21:19:54 Participant: Yes.

21:20:00 Coach: So the other thing I was just going to offer you is like if it happens, you're like "It's day two, and you're like, Jasmine I can't get through these eight cups a day," like we can definitely adjust your health goal to be something more obtainable or something you do feel more comfortable with. That being said, you do have three health goals, and we're going to do the third one now. So, this one just kind of falls back to... you still got two more to like work on. So, let me see. The last health goal you had was around eating fruits or vegetables.

21:20:41 Coach: So, in the next week you will...

21:20:51 Participant: Eat two fruits or vegetables a day. I like this because I feel like now I'm telling you, so I have to hold myself accountable, not just like you hold me accountable. At the very least two. And that is Monday through Friday. If not, I will incorporate some kind of fruit or vegetable into my meal.

21:21:37 Coach: Okay, so you will incorporate them into your meal, somehow. And then, how do you hope to track this?

21:21:57 Participant: I think because it's only two a day at the very least, it's easy for me to keep track like I could do one in the morning and one in the afternoon, like as soon as I wake up and go outside, I try to like eat a banana, or whatever fruits are there like an orange. After I come back from like a walk, I could eat the other one.

21:22:33 Coach: So for this one, is there anything that I can do to support you?

21:22:46 Participant: No, I don't think so. I think that like, I'm able to hold myself accountable on this. I think I could also like ask a friend to do the same thing with me so they and I can like, hold ourselves accountable, which is what we were doing like "did you work out today did you go on the walk" kind of thing. But I think like I could do this one myself.

21:23:12 Coach: And then a confidence level?

21:23:17 Participant: I think the same like a six or seven.

21:23:26 Coach: So, any questions?

21:23:30 Participant: No, no questions. I was gonna say like I feel like this is also one of those things I could eat in the car, I'm driving somewhere, or like when... or you know like even having it next to me. I think the fruit options that you did provide are really like easy to do that like an apple, you just grab and go, orange you just peel and eat. Same with a banana.

21:23:58 Coach: Can you remind me what area you live in?

21:24:00 Participant: I live in East Palo Alto.

21:24:03 Coach: Okay, so like I'm sure there's like farmers markets around.

21:24:10 Participant: Yeah, there's one in Palo Alto. Yeah. Have you been to one before?

21:24:15 Coach: I have been to them. I don't know if they're open right now on the weekend due to COVID, but I could definitely like drive up there on Sunday to see if they are. Yeah, I think... I'm a big fan of the farmers market fruit, fruit specifically like strawberries are in season, and they're just like, so sweet. So yeah, I'd just say go to farmers market. So for next week, I was hoping we can find another time to meet because I did have that conflict. And you said you were available Wednesday after eight?

21:25:02 Participant: I'm available Wednesday after eight. I have time for like 3:10 to 3:40, I think every single day. Mondays, I have the most availability as well. I'm free like right after 3:30, the rest of the day.

21:25:27 Coach: I'm a little concerned about meeting on Monday, because that doesn't give you enough time for the goals. The other option, so I do have 8 o'clock or 8:30 on Wednesday. Or we can meet Friday evening around six o'clock, but I know that's like Friday. Sure, it's a pandemic but like if you have plans, I know maybe you don't want to meet with your health coach.

21:25:55 Participant: I can do... I think you said Wednesday?

21:25:58 Coach: Yeah, I could do Wednesday. So, I'll change that over and then send you the updated invite. Thank you for being flexible.

21:26:16 Participant: Well thank you, I appreciate you accommodating.

21:26:27 Coach: So, next steps for me are just to email this out to you and then check in through text message, no obligations to respond, you can give it like a... if you have an iPhone, you can just like it and then that could be the cue. So no pressure there. And the next steps for you are to work on your health goals, and then you and I will meet next Wednesday at eight.

21:26:57 Coach: Well, that concludes today. Thank you for meeting with me and I'll see you next week.

21:26:59 Participant: Yeah, I'll see you next week. I hope you have a nice weekend.

21:27:02 Coach: Thank you, you too.
