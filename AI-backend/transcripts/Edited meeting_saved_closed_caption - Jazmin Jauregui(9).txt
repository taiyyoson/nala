17:30:48 Participant: Oh no. Yes, lots going on. I was in Denver this morning, so I've been traveling all day.

17:30:58 Coach: Okay, well that's good to know. How was your trip?

17:31:02 Participant: It was really good. It was really good. I just hung out with my sister the whole time and I was like whatever she wants, I'll do it. So Friday we got a hotel room and like we went out and Saturday we hung out with the family and then Sunday we went up to Boulder and hung out with one of her friends who had moved away so it was fun, it was just like, fast, and hectic and expensive. And now... And anyway, I didn't take today off of work so I was working like from the airport and the plane and then I got home, I worked for like two hours and then I had a doctor's appointment, worked for like two more hours and my coworker just called like 20 minutes ago and needed my help with something and so it's just crazy, but good.

17:31:56 Coach: Well, are you back? In California? The crazy work life balancing, isn't it?

17:32:04 Participant: I'm doing good. I feel... I wouldn't say tired, but like, not the most energized, and that's okay.

17:32:15 Coach: That makes sense. But yeah, I was just realizing like this is, I mean I knew this, but like, it's our last session.

17:32:26 Participant: Oh, I don't think I knew that.

17:32:30 Coach: Sorry. No, it's okay. I was like, usually we would have met last week but because of your travel and like my availability we like pushed it out a week. And so, but we can talk about that later, there's no pressure for time, at least on my side, but I do want to be mindful of like how busy your day was so we'll keep the session just right. But, where would you like to start today? We can check in about stress, the text messages or your health goals.

17:33:14 Participant: We can start with the goals just because I started thinking about those already. The steps one went well. I think it helps to have a busy weekend so like on Friday, I got like 15,000 steps without even trying. Like, because I was in the airport in the morning and then my sister and I went out to dinner, we decided to like walk instead of driving to the restaurant and then we walked around after dinner and so, like the whole weekend was like that and so like Friday Saturday Sunday I kind of hit the goals like all three days. So that one was good. Water I'm like I think I drink enough water but I don't think I tracked it all week. So kind of a miss there. And then the meal planning one... Overall I know we talked about this last week but I was like I wanted to give myself the flexibility like knowing that things would change and come up to just like fit those meals in kind of wherever and not like stick to a specific day so that one went well. Overall, but like the day to day was a mess. Just because like last weekend I had one day I was planning on being out and one day I was planning on being in, and like because of the rain the days got switched and so like, stuff like that kind of kept happening, where it was like well I need to finish, like the chicken before I leave, but it doesn't need to be Monday, you know, and it ended up being like Tuesday for lunch or whatever so overall like the intention of that one went well. And I knew that I think going into it so the execution like was what I was expecting it to be, but it wasn't like as successful as it could have been if I had tried to stick to it a little bit more. So I think of that one we had done like 10 out of the 14 meals or something. Yeah, that's the other thing too is I didn't like check them off. Let's see. Let's go find it. I think it's still on my fridge.

17:35:42 Coach: So it sounds like tracking... Yeah, really tracking is the issue, it's not like the doing the action it's just the like keeping track of the action. And I think that with the steps one like because my phone tracks it for me, that one was automatically tracked and much easier to track.

17:35:56 Participant: Yeah exactly. It did not require any effort on my end. Let me try... Why is it saying, "Oh, this person is thinking," okay. I did not... Okay, 1234567899. Wow, that's really good.

17:36:52 Coach: Thank you. 

17:36:52 Participant: Yeah, and like, so for Monday for example I was planning on doing gnocchi because I thought I would have to make one for like charity things that I do in my life, didn't end up needing to make one last week so I like didn't make one for myself. I had this chickpea wrap Hello Fresh kit in my fridge for like three weeks and I kept like thinking I was going to make it and not making it, and I finally just gave it away, because I was like, it's going to go bad, I gave it to my neighbors. Stuff like that. I thought I was going to make chicken parmesan, and I didn't, I forget what I made that night but I like froze the chicken instead because I was like, I have to do something with the chicken so it doesn't go bad and by the time we got to that point I was like, I don't want chicken so... nine.

17:37:51 Coach: Why do you think... if I remember correctly like part of your goal was to be less wasteful which it sounds like you were yeah like by, by giving your food away and by freezing some of it. And then also, like being just more mindful of not like eating... like eating out less if that makes sense.

17:38:14 Participant: So I think because I ran out of Uber Eats money.

17:38:18 Coach: Oh yeah. So, there was like some financial incentive to eating food at home, eating food at home, and so nine out of 10 is like really good. The way the way that you introduced it I was like, oh man like four out of 10 meals but nine out of 10 is a whole different perspective.

17:38:37 Participant: That's true. Yeah. And it helps to like plan it out a little bit and it helped to give myself that flexibility that I knew I was going to want in advance because it didn't feel like I was stuck with it, you know, I think if I had said like I have to stick to it, I would have given up like two days in, but saying like, I've got leftovers on here like twice. It happened to be I don't even know what days but like the days I have leftovers, you know, so anyway, it worked out.

17:39:18 Coach: So, on a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did meeting your goals? This is an overall score. If you want, we can also go into the individual goals.

17:39:37 Participant: I'd say like, eight.

17:39:49 Coach: Any other like reflections you want to share about, like, the steps, or the water or the meal planning? For example, I think last time when you had... I hope I'm not confusing you with another person so I was just saying that.

17:40:15 Participant: I think that kind of happened this week too. So Colorado is at much higher altitude and so I noticed that even though I grew up there like my nose was really dry, my throat was really dry, like, so I had to drink more water. So I didn't track it but I know that I drank more than I usually do because I needed to like because my body was like... The steps one is interesting because I know I met it, but for some reason I'm like telling myself, almost that it doesn't count because I wouldn't have met it in a normal week, like I didn't plan to meet it. I just kind of happened to. And so I'm like oh I wasn't successful but I was, you know, and so I think that there's like a little bit of a disconnect there that it's like, it doesn't feel like sustainable because I don't have days and weeks like that. So, it feels weird that when you asked me for my overall score I was almost like oh like a seven but I met two out of the three and I almost met the third and so I was like No, it's more than a seven it's just like there's some level of disconnect I think between like the planning and execution because that one got executed but I didn't plan it, you know. So yeah, overall I think it went well and it was almost easier and more enjoyable that it wasn't like a chore, you know, it wasn't like "God like I've worked for 15 hours" - 15 hours that was an exaggeration, for 10 hours today and then I need to go take a walk so that I can hit these steps you know it was more like I'm hanging out with my sister and we're having fun and the restaurant's only half a mile away like we'll just walk. And I didn't even notice like, until I checked my phone when I got home, you know, so that was both a good thing and a bad thing because I'm like I wish I had like more weekends like that or more excuses to just be like, I'm going to do something that's fun but also good for me. Excuse me. Sorry I just shoved a bunch of food in my mouth in like the 10 minutes between my one call and the other call so... Yeah, so I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna go to the farmers market this weekend or I'm going to hang out in the city with my friends" like those things get me those steps, like, but that's not day to day stuff for me, you know.

17:43:04 Coach: Well, I'll argue that the week prior you, although you did go out with some family or friends on Friday and still, you still met your walking goal that week. And you did small changes. You walked to get your coffee. You walked to your neighbors, friends. Yeah, so it's like... So I think making those changes to your day to day, or adding those things in your day to day can help you meet your stepping goals like moving forward.

17:43:48 Participant: Yeah. Even that night we went out I think I met it like because we went bar hopping and so we like parked and walked, you know, and I think it's funny because I don't think that my phone thinks I met it because I was out after midnight so it like split it into two days, but I was like, I'm pretty sure I did, you know, like walking like one in the morning. I'm like, it's still yesterday to me. Or like I went hiking with my friend in San Francisco like... Those are things that I do. But I think looking at it as like, because I think that the goal that we set was 4500 a day and not like 20,000 a week, it felt different like because even though the averages were high, I was like, there were three or four days in there when I got like under two or 3000 steps, you know, and so that like it's just a little bit discouraging or it makes me feel like, oh that's, that's like my normal lifestyle and this is like an exception, you know.

17:45:03 Coach: Yeah, I think, again, what we consider normal these days is not normal, due to the pandemic and so I'm not sure what the future holds for us but you know say you did have to go into the office, like you would have to get steps from your car to the door. You were to go out for lunch, you could, I'm not sure where lunch spots were but you would get some steps that way.

17:45:22 Participant: I work upstairs like I'm on the second floor so even like to the car in, up, down, you know, I worked from the office last Monday. And I dropped my car off for an oil change on the way to work. So I like dropped it off and I walked to work. And then at lunch I walked back I picked it up. And then after work I like walked and met my sister at the train station. And so it was like 2000 steps like three times throughout that day but it like added up, you know, I think that those things are nice that it's like okay I could fit this in 10 minute increments without being like, "Oh, I have to go for a 45 minute walk," you know.

17:46:16 Coach: So I wonder, too, like, maybe not an everyday thing, but like two days out of the week you like instead of drive to work you commute by other means, whether that be bus or train or walking? I'm not sure how far your work is... like a mile away? I think those are good alternatives and ways for you to continue to work towards this goal. Is that the water bottle that you were using to track your water?

17:46:56 Participant: It wasn't supposed to be, it's my USF water bottle. But because I was on a plane this weekend I like had to pack something that would like fit in my bag and that I could empty beforehand and refill after security and so this has been like the last three days. It leaked all over my computer, you know. Yeah, it's not good, but it works. So stuff like that and then I went out to eat a ton this weekend, which was fine because I was like it's a special occasion like whatever, this isn't normal, like water with every meal so like glasses of water throughout the day as well.

17:47:40 Coach: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, so I'm like I'm sure I hit it. I just wasn't keeping track.

17:47:48 Participant: Are you still using the plant app to like... whoa I didn't even download that. I thought about it and then I didn't execute it. My actual plants are dying too and so everything is just like a struggle, so...

17:48:09 Coach: Yeah, okay cool. Well, I think a lot of positive things have come from like your three goals and if you want to like do more of the same, we can set goals for this week as well and then also check in with you over the week, but we won't have like another session to see like how you did overall, but hopefully, or I guess let me ask like do you feel like you've learned something from the program so that you can continue to apply it for your future health goals?

17:48:42 Participant: Yeah, I think it was, I think it was helpful. I don't know if, like learned something is the right word because I'm like, I'm a public health student too you know I'm like, I know water is good for me I know I should be gaining steps, you know, I think it was more like the motivation and the accountability and like just doing it, like, I think we talked about this at the beginning, like, I know how to do all these things I'm just not doing them you know and so kind of bridging that gap between like knowledge and execution I think that that has been really helpful. So, I feel like maybe I've like learned skills or have learned... Like, I don't know, not that like I've gained knowledge that I didn't have before.

17:49:46 Coach: Yeah, I think definitely like speaking to the skill building. That was one of our hopes with this specifically around SMART goals and problem solving, so hopefully with today's session, I'll kind of let you take the lead, and then see how you feel about setting SMART goals for yourself in the future. So on a scale of one to 10, what do you think your stress level was like this week?

17:50:33 Participant: It's funny because there's some days it was like a two and there's other days it was like a nine, you know, maybe like a six or seven overall.

17:50:48 Coach: That's fair. I know you did like a lot of traveling and I feel like with the conditions that might have been... And what about the text messages? So you've received all the text messages officially. What about the ones from last week? What messages stick out to you? Any of them motivate you?

17:51:14 Participant: Yeah, let me see. I'm like I'm remembering a fruit emoji. I really appreciated the random water reminders. The emojis are cute. I like the like bilingualism of them. Oh, I got the HPS text... Yeah okay I'm like I don't even think I saw this last one like the "gracias" with the participants you're in one until just now. So, I think that there were a couple that like slipped through the cracks and that's not anything about like the message in particular it's just about my life. I liked them. Thank you.

17:52:34 Coach: Any other comments you wanted to make about them?

17:52:38 Participant: No, I don't think so.

17:52:41 Coach: So then, let's chat about your health goals for this week. Yeah. Where, where do you want to go?

17:52:52 Participant: Good question. I have such a stressful week. I've got like appointments every single day. And so, and my sleep schedule is all off right now because of the time zone and then like being up early for flights and stuff and so I know I'll be up early the next couple of days and I'm almost like I should start work early because I'm going to have to take time off for appointments and stuff. So, maybe something like taking stretch breaks throughout the day or... Yeah, that would probably be a good one because I feel like right now like, I'll take a few breaks throughout the day and I'll just like go and lie in bed, which doesn't help. And I know like it's just going to be busy and I can't, I can't be like, I'm going to take a 45 minute walk on my lunch break but I could take... Excuse me, I could take like a three to five minute stretch break you know and like walk and get the mail or like stretch my neck and shoulders or whatever so I think that would be a good one. I'm trying to look ahead... Maybe like screen free time in the evening would be nice too so instead of like turning on the TV or scrolling through Twitter or whatever like saying you know I'm going to have like half an hour of screen free time you know and take a shower, make dinner, read a book or whatever, like, just because I know I'm going to be working like 10 hour days and have early mornings and so having a little bit of time in the evening, after work and before bed to like not be online would be nice. Those are my two.

17:55:13 Coach: So I'm trying to think, in the emails that I send you I usually write your goal in the way that we talk about it, using the SMART goal method. Do you feel like you have a... you could phrase these in the SMART goal way?

17:55:34 Participant: Yeah, I'm like I already forgot what my first one was... no no I got it, but I'm like God I'm tired. So for the stretch one like I will take one stretch break, one three to five minute stretch break per work day this week away from my computer. Specific, Measurable, Attainable... No, it's not attainable. I always mess up the A right.

17:56:22 Coach: No attainable, attainable, realistic and timely, not realistic I mess up the R... relevant and timely. Yeah, so, it could be either or but for this, for our purposes, I like to use relevant to help us determine like why this is important to you.

17:56:31 Participant: That's right. Okay, three to five minute stretch break once a day on work days to have more energy to get through these long work days. It's like to give myself some time away from my computer and because I won't be able to take longer breaks this week, or like, yeah, I still will take lunch but I'm going to be... it will be more challenging. Yeah.

17:57:30 Coach: So, in the next week you will take a three to five minute stretch break once per work day away from your computer. This goal is important to you because you want to make sure you have more energy throughout the day and you want to give yourself time away from the computer. Going to the obtainable piece... You've kind of alluded to reminders being helpful. Yeah. For this goal, do you want to take the, or do you want to have like a random reminder? Do you want to put it on your calendar? Do you want a phone reminder, at a specific time, at random times?

17:58:49 Participant: Good questions. I was thinking I might just like put a sticky note on my monitor, like, do it when I see it, because my schedule every day is like it just fluctuates and so there's not a good time that I could be like, "Oh 2pm every day will work." And I will just ignore a phone alarm or my calendar. I'll like see it and be like, "oh, OK, I can take three to five minutes," you know. So I might just, I might do something a little bit more passive, just knowing myself.

17:59:42 Coach: So I guess another question that's coming up for me is when do you think a break would be best like for you, like, is a break after your morning meetings or a break after your afternoon meetings like, when do you find yourself needing that break?

18:00:09 Participant: That's a good question. The first like hour or two are rough. Typically after a morning meeting I'll like go make breakfast because by that point I'm starving... It really depends and like tomorrow I'm working from the office so I like won't get up to make breakfast, like, at 10am you know I'll like order lunch with my co workers at like normal lunchtime, you know, and then Wednesday, I have class and so I like log off earlier and so there's like all this like... Thursday I have a vet appointment in the morning so I'm logging on later like it's all this stuff where I'm just like, I don't even know. The first couple hours tend to be rough and then probably like early mid afternoon like between three and four. I'm like, tired. I'm ready to be done. And so that's a good time for like a second break.

18:01:21 Coach: So, kind of, based on what you've shared, I'm thinking like, 11am is a good time and or three to 4pm is another good time. Yeah. 

18:01:33 Participant: I think it's also just like when I feel the urge to get up from my desk and go lie in bed like, that's it, you know. So like, use that urge to lie in bed.

18:01:54 Coach: I did have another question... That's not the question that like escaped me but, for the days that you go into work do you use the same laptop?

18:02:10 Participant: Yeah.

18:02:27 Coach: I remember my other question. So, for the three to five minute stretch break, I wonder if you can be more descriptive about it? For example like you're gonna roll your neck, or you're gonna like do... what did I forget these were? They make you extend your arms and do like little circles... Do you kind of have a flow of what you would like your stretch break to look like?

18:02:59 Participant: So not really. So we just did like a mindfulness challenge with work, it was like 14 days and each day was a stretch and like a meditation. And some days were like just neck and shoulders and so like rolling your neck and whatever for seven minutes. And then other days were like yoga routines and so it kind of depends like what is bothering me. Sometimes I just like want to get on the ground and do like Child's Pose and like cat cows or whatever, like stretch out my back and other times I'm like, "Oh, it's just my neck and my shoulders giving me attention." So it kinda depends. I'd say those two are probably like the primary ones but it would depend more on like what I feel like I need, unless I'm like "this is what I have to do today," you know.

18:04:04 Coach: So I think and also from based on like past goals, you, you do a lot better with that flexibility, like instead of being... instead of being so structured you could do better with flexibility. So I've just put parentheses like neck, shoulder, back and legs. Yep. And then you'll just decide like what all of those look like and on what days you'll do what, what's calling to you.

18:04:36 Coach: So you're going to do this once a day, Monday through Friday, essentially. What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal on a scale of one to 10?

18:04:51 Participant: I'm like an eight.

18:04:58 Coach: For your second SMART goal, it was around reducing your screen time yeah in the evenings.

18:05:19 Participant: In the next week I will spend half an hour away from screens. Let's say four evenings a week because with class that evening is hard... to wind down before bed, rest my eyes and my brain. And maybe like do activities, do screen-free activities that I enjoy and otherwise wouldn't do, basically.

18:06:21 Coach: So kind of going through the same list of questions of like, do we need a reminder for this? Do we want to have it be a specific time?

18:06:40 Participant: No to the specific time question because it will depend on like, what time I finished work and like, if I have class, if I have other things after work, those things. I don't know in terms of a reminder, maybe like a list of things that I like want to do so, like, take a shower, cook dinner, like finish this book, start this other book, you know, crochet... like a list of like alternate things that I could choose from. I have some yarn here, I've been trying to crochet a hat and I like can't figure it out and so like picking that back up, you know, and then because it is timed, like I think starting a timer and like, if after the timer was over like I want to keep doing what I'm doing I can but like... So I can't be like, "Oh, it's been half an hour, you know I'm going to scroll through Twitter again," you know, or, you know, whatever, you know, I think that having a timer might make it more like accountable to myself.

18:08:26 Coach: So, in terms of your like your list of alternatives, I have shower, crochet, read a book, cook dinner, were there others that you wanted me to include?

18:08:35 Participant: Go for a walk could be one. I'm like listening to an audiobook on my phone right now but like I could do that without like being on my phone.

18:08:55 Coach: And then, I know you mentioned having like a really busy schedule this week and you specified wanting to do it for four nights. Do you feel like you have capacity for four nights?

18:09:10 Participant: Good question. So, I was thinking, not Wednesday because I have class. But also, I feel like I would benefit from it most if I did it on Wednesday, because that's like, when I've been staring at a computer for 14 hours straight. And then I was also thinking maybe not Friday, so that I could like watch TV after work and like not feel guilty about it, you know. So yeah, I mean, it's only half an hour, you know, so I could take a shower and make dinner and still have time to watch TV for four hours, you know...

18:09:57 Coach: We could go with three because we could say not Wednesday and Friday and that would, I would have to start today. Even if that... you know, three nights a week. So, in the next week you will spend half an hour away from your screen on three nights. During this time, you can shower, crochet, read, cook dinner or go for a walk with an audiobook. And then to help you keep track of time, you're going to use a timer. And then this is important to you because you'd like to have, or you'd like to wind down before bed, rest your eyes, and do screen free activities that you enjoy. On a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting this goal?

18:10:58 Participant: I'm probably like an eight again. It is only half an hour. Only half an hour. Yeah. Half an hour I'm like that's basically like a shower, you know.

18:11:13 Coach: Well, I'm with you there on long showers. So I'll email these to you so that you have them to reference. Is there any, like, support that you need from me to help you meet your health goals?

18:11:31 Participant: Like random check ins would still be appreciated, I'm sure.

18:11:43 Coach: Are there days that you prefer I check in with you?

18:11:55 Participant: Not necessarily. We're doing weekdays, but I mean any of the next four days would be fine.

18:12:19 Coach: So that concludes our health coaching session. There's a little bit more details regarding the... we call it feedback, a feedback meeting and I don't know why I find it to be such a mouthful, feedback meeting. And so, for this we ask that you complete a, like a 15 minute survey, and then meet with another person to talk about your experience and let us know, whatever feedback you have about the program. So, you should receive that email either today or the survey either today or tomorrow. And then, when would be a good time to schedule a meeting for your feedback? It could be this week or next week.

18:13:15 Participant: Next week would be good. Either like this time, Monday or Thursday.

18:13:34 Coach: Let's do Thursday, so the 13th. Yeah. That is Thursday the 13th. From like five... there's five to six or like 5:30 to 6:30 just in case. I'll send you a Google invite and we just ask that you please fill out the survey before joining the meeting. Any questions about that?

18:14:40 Participant: No, I don't think so.

18:14:42 Coach: Okay, well this is a goodbye and thank you for joining. It's been such a pleasure to work with you over these last few weeks. You've worked so hard, I feel good about like everything that you've accomplished in the short amount of time. And you can use the skills that you've learned or enhanced I should say, to like help you meet your health goals in the future. And just a heads up, I will be on campus in the fall so if you're around... Yes, I will be. I may actually be in your... What's it called... evaluation class in the fall. So, this isn't goodbye forever but just bye for now. Yeah. Any, any questions or other thoughts?

18:15:41 Participant: I am good, this was helpful and good and well timed I think. With like COVID starting to wrap up, I think I was at a place in my life a couple weeks ago to be like, I'm gonna start making some changes so it was good timing, and I appreciate the help and the accountability and the skills and all those things so I had a good experience.

18:16:06 Coach: Yeah, me too. Thanks for letting me in on your journey. Alrighty, well have a good evening, and good luck with the week, and your health goals. Thank you. And we'll see you next week.

18:16:22 Participant: All right. Okay, bye.
