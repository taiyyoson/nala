18:59:58 Coach: Hi.How are you?

19:00:02 Participant: I'm good, how are you?

19:00:09 Coach: Very good to meet you. My name is Erica, and thank you so much for joining me today. If all of a sudden you see something on my face it's because I'm trying something new, I have this light. But whenever I put it on top of my computer, it reflects on my eyes too much. I was thinking of maybe attaching it to that hanging plant, but I think it might fall on my face but let's see. So my name is Erica, and I will be your health coach for the next four weeks. I want to provide you with a quick introduction, and then we can transition into setting your health goals. How does that sound?

19:00:57 Participant: Yeah, that sounds good.

19:01:04 Coach: So as you've noticed, EXAMEN is a two part intervention. One aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving and I'm pretty sure you should be by now. Have you been getting those?

19:01:16 Participant: Yes, I have.

19:01:18 Coach: Very good. And the second part is the health coaching, and I will be your health coach for that part. In my role as your health coach, I will be meeting with you once a week through zoom for at least 20 minutes. If we need more time, I'm flexible with that. We just need to talk about how much time that would be so that we can schedule it accordingly. And during that time we'll check in about daily text messages, what your thoughts are on those. We'll also set a goal. So we're going to be discussing goal setting today. And I'll also be asking you about your stress level, so how stressed do you feel on a scale of one to 10, for example. And in between each week, I'll be texting, just asking hey how's your goal coming along, and if anything comes up, feel free to reach out to me. If you reply to the text messages I do get those directly so feel free to respond and I'll do my best to get back to you as soon as possible. If there's any topics that come up that might be outside of my scope of expertise as your health coach, I will do my best to connect you with proper resources. This is a research study so we will be collecting data, but just know that any specific conversations will be kept confidential and data will be de-identified at the end of all this. So you are welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. And we want to make sure that this is a safe environment for you and that you feel open to share your thoughts. By the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around problem solving, goal setting which we'll discuss today, and feel empowered to manage your physical, your mental and your spiritual health. So I really want to thank you for choosing to participate. Your participation will really guide the future of this program and whether we can offer this to a larger scale of students in the future. Do you have questions before we get started?

19:03:32 Participant: Well, kind of. I guess it's the only question. Well first thank you for that introduction. It really clarifies some things. I guess my biggest goal or biggest thing right now is, do I have to have like certain, a certain level of like, you know, have already like a goal or be already like in the maintenance stage or something or is it kind of like not necessary?

19:04:16 Coach: No. So every week, I do an assessment of where we are with goals, and the goal is to prepare you and get you thinking about things. You could be at any of those stages. Maybe you're in preparation, maybe you're in pre contemplation, maybe you're just thinking about it. And the goal during our sessions is to get you to actually set a goal on what you want to do. So if you've been thinking about something we'll set a goal, we'll make it measurable, we'll make it specific, so that you're able to achieve that during the week. And if you think you really want to start to eat healthier for example, but you really don't know where to start, maybe the first step is to do some research about what it would be like a proper meal plan for you, for example, or maybe meet with a registered dietitian so they could guide you through what would be a good start. Or if you know, Okay, I know that I want to incorporate, I don't know, more vegetables to my meals, then that's something that we can talk about and figure out how do we do that. You don't need to be in action mode now. If anything, we want you to be ready for that so that we can talk about how do we get you to action. Right.

19:05:28 Participant: Okay. That was my other question that, yeah that was my only question I have right now.

19:05:33 Coach: Yeah, so it's more of a time for us to discuss what are the goals that you have. What are the things that you want to work towards, and then together we could figure out what will be the next steps that we can take to motivate you. Anything else that you are hoping to check in about today?

19:06:00 Participant: Not really. Not right now.

19:06:11 Coach: So I'll start by asking you to tell me a little bit more about yourself and tell me in signing up for this program. What were some of your thoughts or hopes? What do you want to achieve?

19:06:24 Participant: Yeah, so, um, so I'm, as you know a USF student. And I'm doing the MMFT program there so it's been pretty, pretty great, I love it but it also does add on kind of a level of stress, you know with grad school and like having work too so you know I was actually, I didn't initially see the email, one of my classmates told me about it so I was like, oh yeah this is great because on top of the stress part of it. It was, you know, eating healthier, being a little more, you know I want to exercise more. I think because of the pandemic it's something that I, I've just I stopped you know and it's, I am not doing like anything right now so it's, I've already had been thinking of it, you know with meal prepping some weeks and not others. And so, I felt like it was kind of, I don't know, like a good opportunity for me to, you know, participate in something that's going to I don't know, kind of help me but also maybe help the research for like Latinx or Latino students, you know, and so yeah that I mean that was a big piece too, you know, because it's, it's really not very often that we find a lot of like tailored to culture or to, you know, I don't know very specific like women USF students.

19:07:58 Coach: So I'm getting goosebumps as I hear you talk about this. Yeah, it's very dear to our hearts too. And I'm part of a team so it's not just a one person thing. This would have been overwhelming otherwise. And it means a lot to us that you see it that way and that you want to participate in it to help us to improve this and to really offer this to all the students at USF. I think that would be amazing.

19:08:30 Coach: So I heard a little bit there about how being in the MMFT program, it's causing you another added layer of stress. So every week I will be asking you about your stress level so let's start with a little bit of that too. On a scale of one to 10, what would you say your stress level was this week?

19:08:54 Participant: Um, I would say it was probably a good seven or eight just because it's not just the school. I think this weekend was really rough on my family too, and just work is kind of also always high intense. I work with a community mental health program so for high intense clients. And so I think that this week was really, there was no rest in the weekend for me, and yeah and then just family stuff that's been going on.

19:09:30 Coach: Well thank you for sharing that. I think it's important to talk about things that are going on and how it affects our stress level right? It affects a lot of the different things that are going on in our lives and our ability to be able to cope with all of that. You know, you also mentioned a little bit earlier about how given what's currently happening in the pandemic there's a lot of things that you're not able to do or you haven't been doing, but you talked about thinking of exercise and meal prepping. So as of now, what would you say, or how would you rate how you're doing with your goals? So let's say you had some goals in the past around health and wellness. How are you doing meeting those goals right now, this moment?

19:10:27 Participant: Let's say I'm not meeting them. So I'm not doing too great.

19:10:32 Coach: Yeah, no, no. Yeah. And, I mean, it's, there's a lot of different things happening right now so I think it's just important to be kind to yourself and thinking about what comes next is important. And that's sort of why we're here now to figure out what comes next. All right, yeah. So in thinking about this program and the different things that you want to achieve, because you mentioned a few things like managing stress because there's quite a bit of stress going on, the healthy eating piece and physical activity. What is something that you would want to start with, if you could choose one of those for this upcoming week?

19:11:20 Participant: I would say, um, I don't know if this is cheating because I kind of already have it in place but health wise. I think that I've been in the like contemplation, action, I guess, because I recently like scheduled appointments and physical appointment because I feel like that's kind of for me I want to know where I'm at with like lab work. I think that's kind of where it starts. So, you know, I have appointments scheduled and just health wise you know like women's health too. So, you know, making sure I'm up to date with that. It's something that I feel like I, yeah, it's, I had, I had to kind of postpone it just not really taking care of that. So I would say maybe they're like making sure I attend to get all the stuff that I need to get done. And, but I don't know if that if that is kind of what you're asking about or...

19:12:22 Coach: Any of those things, I think you bring up a point in terms of sometimes we don't know what we need to start with and we haven't done. If we don't know where we are now right? We need to do an evaluation of how is my health at this moment. So that's something that you want to work on for this week. I think it's definitely having like your annual physical, that's always has something to do as part of our health and well being. So in thinking about that piece, we do want to set a SMART goal around it and I'm sure you might be familiar with the term. So we want to make it specific, we want to make it measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. So at this point, you've set an appointment. Is that appointment going to happen within the next week or is it that you still need to make the appointment and you will make it within the next week but it might be for a future date?

19:13:17 Participant: Yeah. So for the women's health one, that one is tomorrow. And I still need to make the PCP appointment. I was looking at some dates. It's just that I don't want to miss, like, I have two appointments in the same week because of work. And it's like I want them the same schedule. So I was thinking of scheduling that next week. Scheduling something for next week. Because I think what they're doing right now is video or telephone appointment with your doctor and then they're just sending you to labs to get lab work done so I'm sure that hopefully it'll be something fast I can do next week.

19:14:03 Coach: So I'm thinking about the goal that we set for this week. So let's say today is Wednesday. Yes. My goal will be if we can check in next Wednesday. If Wednesdays at seven work for you. And that way, the new goal that we set will be for seven days right? So from today Wednesday, to next Wednesday. What do you think it's achievable for you to do from today till next Wednesday when we check back in?

19:14:33 Participant: I would say for sure, attend my appointment tomorrow and also have have already scheduled my PCP appointment. I mean if not already have done it but let's just go with the scheduled. I think you got it.

19:14:58 Coach: So attending the women's health check, is that the appropriate name for it, it's like ob gyn or like woman's health, I don't know. Is that what they consider like the women's wellness check or something like that?

19:15:19 Participant: I don't know that the department is called like woman's health through Kaiser because that's like it'll be like the woman's health. But, I don't know.

19:15:33 Coach: So that's Thursday, and is that in the morning, or afternoon?

19:15:47 Participant: Afternoon.

19:15:56 Coach: We have a women's health checkup Thursday afternoon to sort of get a baseline. Right. Yeah. And then just the checkup, like annual or, you know, just the checkup. And then the other part would be, and how confident do you feel about being able to do this?

19:16:17 Participant: I'm pretty confident about tomorrow's. Yeah. I'm pretty confident. I feel like it took a while but I finally scheduled one, so I'm naturally kind of going into it very confident, how would you rate it?

19:16:29 Coach: Okay, sorry, one not confident and ten very confident.

19:16:39 Participant: Nine. Yeah.

19:16:43 Coach: And then you mentioned the second goal is to set up an appointment with your primary care provider right?

19:16:57 Participant: Yes.

19:16:57 Coach: So just scheduling the appointment itself, that will be the activity. How long do you think it's going to take you to do that? Is there a specific day of the week that you want to dedicate to calling to set up my appointment?

19:17:14 Participant: Maybe I can say by the end of this week so by Friday. Because I'll have a good, a better feel of what my week will look like next week for work.

19:17:37 Coach: And I will send you a summary of the goal that you set for today. But, yeah, feel free to write it any time if that helps you remember. How confident do you feel about being able to schedule this appointment?

19:18:22 Participant: I'm a 10.

19:18:24 Coach: Any other goals or things that you wanted to work on for this week or do you think those two are a good start? Like, like as far as health wise or for any, like, for health and wellness that you want to work on.

19:18:48 Participant: I would say for the stress level, kind of, I think, I would want to like meditate more. I know that usually that helps me. In the past, that's helped me. Sorry in the past and so I wouldn't want to do something more. I used to do it every day and it was really great but like before going to bed. That might be a little too much right now. Like if I try to do every day right now.

19:19:16 Coach: Do you want to start with two days during the week, three days, what is, or maybe one day what is feasible for you. And how long is it? Five minutes, 10 minutes.

19:19:37 Participant: I would say maybe three times in the week. I started doing it so I'm pretty confident with three times a week for at least 10 minutes. That's all I can do. Yeah, because I have the app. The headspace app. And I used to do the full courses and I could be still for the 20 or 30 minutes and right. I know I can't right now, I've tried. So I would say like 10 minutes, five to 10 minutes or so.

19:20:15 Coach: And the idea is that it's something achievable, something that, you know, you'll be able to do. And just to kind of give you a little background on that is when we set up goals that are achievable and we are able to succeed, that's going to push us, succeeding it's going to push us to try something more to keep us motivated. So we definitely want you to succeed. Okay, so if you feel that five minutes is all you could do right now, or if you feel 10 minutes might be too much, we can scale that back to five minutes, whatever you think it's going to make it a reality. Right. So I have meditate, and you'll use your headspace app or did you want additional resources for that?

19:21:02 Participant: Um, yeah, I don't usually use that because it has like soundscapes too and it has a lot of things in that app that I, I really like. I've used it in the past and I like it.

19:21:16 Coach: Okay. So practice meditation for 10 minutes. And you mentioned you want to do this at night before going to bed?

19:21:30 Participant: Yes. At night because I'm usually, the morning I'm, I'm pretty, I wake up pretty, you know, I usually have a hard time sleeping, but I'm pretty good at waking up in the morning.

19:21:50 Coach: Practice meditation for 10 minutes, three times a week. And how do you remember to do this?

19:22:01 Participant: Well, you know, I would say, I was gonna say like, I have the sleep app on my phone but I know that sometimes I ignore it, so I know that that's not. I mean I can put an alarm but it's kind of the same thing where it'll kind of cover the notification on my phone and I'll just like snooze it or, I don't know.

19:22:28 Coach: Yeah. What do you think would work?

19:22:45 Participant: I don't know maybe like, I don't know what, that's a good question. Because tracking it you can track the minutes on the app itself right?

19:23:09 Coach: Yes. So that's a good way to track it itself. Is there a way that the app sends you a notification to remind you to meditate or is that one doesn't do that? I know some do.

19:23:27 Participant: I usually see just because I turned off my notifications. Sometimes just having a lot is a little much for me. But I think that you know I think I can I can look and see. Maybe that might be the goal. Oh, here it is, notifications. Oh bedtime reminders, oh yeah there is.

19:23:50 Coach: I mean, you mentioned that you set one on your phone before and you're likely to snooze it, but I wonder if you get it from the app it might be different. The other thing that I'm thinking is do you go to bed at a regular time every day?

19:24:04 Participant: Um, I think it depends. I hum usually when I actually when I do meditate, I will. But right now, since I'm getting back to it. Lately, to be honest, it's been pretty all over.

19:24:22 Coach: Yeah, now I can completely relate to that. Yeah, because I'm thinking if you were to set consistent time schedule for going to bed three days during the week. You're associating, you can associate that with also the meditation and that can do, like, two in one ride. You're going to bed by this time, and then because I'm going to meditate, and that will be like another reminder, but a more physical reminder, so that you don't just like snooze the phone and keep doing what you're doing. Right.

19:24:56 Participant: Oh I see, okay, yeah maybe we can, I can try doing like Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

19:25:03 Coach: Okay, like setting that intention. We have quite a few for this week. Yeah, I think these are good right now. This is really good and yes I would not have you, I would not recommend more than that. I think you have plenty to work for the upcoming week. How confident do you feel about being able to meditate three times a week?

19:25:45 Participant: I would say eight.

19:25:50 Coach: That's very good. And you mentioned that this is something that you've done in the past right and now you're sort of trying to get back into it right?

19:26:08 Participant: Yeah yeah and I know that even this week alone, it's been what like two nights, three nights already. I'll follow through with some and others I'll just turn my phone off because I can't. So that's why I'm, you know, I'm in that in between.

19:26:25 Coach: It's part of getting ready to make change so I think as long as you are very aware of sort of where you are in that process of making changes. And now we just need to get you motivated to do it and then keep it going. But I think it's very important. In terms of the messages that you received so far for the daily text messages. Do you have any feedback on those? What were some of the messages that really stood out to you?

19:27:02 Participant: Yeah, well you know actually getting the messages I think really, it keeps me mindful, because I'll like forget to. I mean, not that I won't forget, sometimes I'll like okay. So there was one, let me look at it. Okay. There was one that said, think about the things in your day that give you a sense of peace, bring joy and connection. Remind yourself of them every day. And I think that it really, that one really resonated with me especially that day. It was a rough morning and so I think that helps kind of like a reminder, like, out of nowhere, it came in and I was like Yeah Okay, calm down or. So I would say that I really liked that one, that one was the biggest one for me. I know I keep talking about stress. I think that's like the biggest thing for me.

19:27:56 Coach: Yeah. And I mean that is very present in your life right now. So it's going to be messages that you see that sort of bring that up, that you want to do something about it. You're trying to figure out how to address it. So I'm hoping that even the messages themselves give you ideas about how, you know, you gotta stop and just take a deep breath and do something nice for yourself and find ways to alleviate some of that stress.

19:28:26 Participant: Yeah, yeah, I think the health ones. I think those kind of like. Sorry, my sister's outside. She's doing some gardening. Perfect timing right now. I feel like any of that stuff.

19:28:58 Coach: No, no, no. It's completely fine. No, no need to apologize.

19:29:08 Participant: But you were saying, sorry, but yeah the health, the health text messages were, because I feel like I want, I want to do more goals around that like healthy eating and exercise. And I think that those are like reminders like those little nudges. That kind of like, Okay, not that okay they don't make me feel guilty. They don't, but when I read them it's like, no, that's, that is what I want. That's what I want, and like the fact that they're like, I think there was something about even blood pressure just health wise. There's something about diabetes and how doing certain things can help decrease the chances of having diabetes. Yeah, yeah and then the servings of fruits and veggies. You know, I think it brings a little more consciousness to what kind of affects me.

19:30:16 Coach: Okay, yeah. That's the goal. And yes, I think just like you said they're not meant to make you feel guilty in any way shape or form. If anything is to give you facts, to give you ideas about things that we can do, and how do we really find a way to incorporate that into our daily lives. So that is not an extra thing that we have to worry about, because that's how we want habits to be. We want it to just be part of our routine. It shouldn't be an extra burden that we have to focus on. Right, yeah. And we have, we have three more sessions after today. So next week we can start thinking about do we want to work on a different topic, for example, healthy eating or physical activity. So every week you can choose to work on something different. Or we can keep working on stress management. It's really up to what you want to do, whatever you feel is going to be more useful for you to help you move forward into the other goals that you want to work on. Right.

19:31:21 Participant: That's good to know. That's good to know because I do want to touch on that, too. I think these were kind of popping out more at me. And so I'm glad that we can focus on something else.

19:31:31 Coach: Yeah, yeah, of course, there's this is free, this is your time and it's for us to figure out how to better support you and your health and wellness goals.

19:31:43 Participant: I appreciate it.

19:31:45 Coach: So one of the things that we'll do after today's session is I'll send you a reminder of sort of the goals that we set for today. And I'll send you calendar invites so that we can meet weekly on Wednesdays at seven. And then what was the other thing, the last session would be May 5. Like Cinco de Mayo. Like we, but we can we can flex that if you want, if you have plans that day.

19:32:28 Participant: I do, I do have plans that day. That's the only day that wouldn't work. Other than that the 21st and 28th work for me.

19:32:49 Coach: So let's plan for the 21st and the 28th. And then on the 28th, we can see how the schedule looks for the last week. How does that sound?

19:32:50 Participant: Okay, that sounds good, because right now. I mean, right now it looks fine, but in case anything comes up I think it gives us time to still plan for the last week.
Right, yeah. Yeah, the only day I think that I mean other than that I'm flexible for the only day is Thursdays because I have class that day.

19:33:23 Coach: You have class on Thursdays? Yeah so other than that, Monday, Tuesday, Friday work for me. And Friday evening?

19:33:33 Participant: Yes okay yeah that's okay. Yeah, me too.

19:33:35 Coach: Okay. Then we'll do that. I'll send you the calendar invite for the 21st and the 28th and then on the 28th we'll check in about our last session and when that will be.

19:33:46 Participant: Okay, sounds good.

19:33:48 Coach: Any other questions you might have for me today?

19:33:51 Participant: No, not. I really appreciate this like the whole initiative and, you know, I think it's a really good. I really hope this could be expanded, I really do.
