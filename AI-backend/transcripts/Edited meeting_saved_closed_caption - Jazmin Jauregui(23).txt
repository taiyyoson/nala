12:01:09 Participant: Hello.

12:01:11 Coach: Hi. How are you?

12:01:13 Participant: Good, how are you?

12:01:15 Coach: Good. Did you get home pretty late from work last night?

12:01:20 Participant: Yeah, I got home at like 11.

12:01:24 Coach: Oh well, yeah. Working hard. Yeah, thanks for being so flexible, like oh my gosh they called me last minute.

12:01:35 Participant: No, that's totally fine. I'm glad we were able to find the time.

12:01:38 Coach: Yeah, me too. But, how are you doing otherwise?

12:01:45 Participant: I'm good. Like I told you I met my goals this week. I haven't had a chance to go to the gym, so I'm actually going to go this evening after I have an appointment. So I'll be leaving like after we end the Zoom.

12:02:04 Coach: So what time do you need to end by, like by 12:30?

12:02:08 Participant: OK, for sure, yeah no later because I have to like be out the house by like 12:35.

12:02:15 Coach: Yeah I don't anticipate us meeting beyond that, but I know like if you need to go like, I can give you more time if needed, I totally will. Cool, well how do you feel about meeting your goals this last week?

12:02:30 Participant: It was good. I mean, I went for three days which was good and I did the 45 minutes on all three days. So that was nice. It's just like, I'm glad I went the days that I went because after that my week just turned crazy. It went from Monday to Friday like that. I'm glad I went when I did.

12:02:52 Coach: Yeah, I remember last time you had kind of shared more about like the benefits of having gone. Did you see those benefits again?

12:03:02 Participant: Yeah, I've been... good time management has been good. I've just... yeah this week was crazy but in a good way, like busy. Yeah, it's been a big improvement like I actually miss going and I look forward to when I do have days versus like dreading it before. I think because I was trying to do that like 5 in the morning stuff and nobody likes to wake up at that time. So now I actually look forward to it because I don't have that pressure of like having to go at a certain time, it's just as long as I go.

12:03:43 Coach: Yeah, cool, I like that.

12:03:50 Coach: So, with the scale questions. On a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did in meeting your goal?

12:03:57 Participant: For sure a 10.

12:03:59 Coach: Okay, awesome. And then the stress question, on a scale of one to 10, what do you think your stress level has been like this week?

12:04:08 Participant: Like a two.

12:04:10 Coach: Oh okay, so busy but not stressful?

12:04:12 Participant: Yeah. It's been good busy, busy in a good way.

12:04:18 Coach: Cool to hear. Are you done with classes as well?

12:04:24 Participant: Yeah. So it's nice to not have... I have a few weeks off till summer starts.

12:04:43 Coach: And what do you... Do you have any plans for this time, like any trips anywhere, self care activities?

12:04:52 Participant: Yeah, I'm going to Hawaii for a week.

12:04:55 Coach: How exciting! Have you been before?

12:04:57 Participant: No, it's gonna be my first time so that's like... yeah I have an appointment and I have to get like everything ready today and then I work tomorrow so it's like I only have basically today and then Sunday to like get last minute things.

12:05:15 Coach: Where are you going to?

12:05:17 Participant: Oahu so I'm going to Honolulu.

12:05:23 Coach: I've never been to that island before, but Hawaii has the best activities like water activities, hiking activities. I'm so excited for you.

12:05:35 Participant: I'm so excited so yes I'm looking forward to that. And then I'll come back and have like a few days off before my summer classes start so, yeah, it was a good break. Yes, very much needed.

12:05:56 Coach: Awesome. Well, I will be wishing you like all good energy.

12:06:06 Participant: I'm so excited for it. I just want to relax. Yeah and adventure. Like slow down from the city life, the work life, just have fun. I'm so... like warm water, like, oh my god I'm looking forward to it so much.

12:06:31 Coach: So, since this is our last health coaching session, I wonder like what you would want your health goal to be. And maybe it could be as simple as like 10 minutes in the sun to get your vitamin D. I know you're going to be like in the sun a lot and it's really hot... I know the humidity.

12:06:52 Participant: I'm not looking forward to that. I don't like the heat, but I'm like hopefully we're going to spend a lot of time in the water where I won't feel it, and then it's just temporary so it'll be nice. My health goal is to still try to do something like active, not necessarily going to the gym but like we're going to have a few hikes planned out, maybe like riding bikes or something. And like you said like going out in the sun, but yeah my health goal overall is to just do something active, at least once a day, some type of activity that gets me up and moving and not just sitting around eating all day.

12:07:47 Coach: I wonder if you... I'm just gonna throw this out there and let me know if it lands. I think being active every day is going to be a really great goal. And also, if we can frame it as self care because I think that's the whole point of your trip is just to like take a break, and I want your goal to be maybe a little more aligned with that. And if you feel being active once a day aligns with that, cool. If you feel like I'm just going to take like a break, that could be helpful in itself like I wanted to be like fun and like low bar for you.

12:08:32 Participant: Yeah, I mean I don't want that pressure of like having to go to the gym. But I do want to explore the island and do fun things so even if it's like swimming or snorkeling like that's still an activity where you're moving, you know.

12:08:53 Coach: Cool. So, it's self care, plus good for your body so it's like a good combination.

12:08:58 Participant: Yeah, mind, body, soul type of thing.

12:08:58 Coach: Are you going with anyone?

12:09:01 Participant: So I have a friend that lives there now so she just moved there so I'm visiting her and then another friend from San Diego, who I went to school with because I went to college down there, she's meeting me there so it's gonna be like the three amigos linking up together.

12:09:16 Coach: Nice! That sounds like it'll be so fun. Nice like girls time. It's a girls trip, very much needed. So, for your health goal. In the next week, you will have... how do you want me to finish that?

12:09:55 Participant: In the next week, I will do one fun and active activity per day.

12:10:09 Coach: And then do you want this to be like for five days or seven days?

12:10:14 Participant: Five, because like I'm there a total of seven but the travel days don't really count. So I have like five real days there.

12:10:28 Coach: Cool. And so, let's see, we have it specific, we have it measurable so like one activity a day, obtainable - you're going to be in a beautiful place with a lot of activities. And you did speak to this already but like, why is it important to you?

12:10:49 Participant: Just like you said like self care, so like some peace of mind, helps with stress, as well as just like trying something new.

12:11:11 Coach: So, on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

12:11:18 Participant: A 10.

12:11:19 Coach: I like that.

12:11:21 Participant: Only because activities are already booked and, like, I'm not going on vacation to sit in a house all day. So, yes it is going to be a 10.

12:11:31 Coach: Make sure to pack a water bottle like a reusable water bottle and sunscreen and bug spray, like if you get mosquitoes.

12:11:45 Participant: I need to get like bug spray. I need to get like a big one. I might just buy that over there. And, oh I just bought one of those, like cell phone waterproof cases so I can take my phone with me, because before I always leave my phone behind because I've never done anything to this extent but I'm like I want to take pictures or at least record some of this stuff, you know.

12:12:28 Coach: It's gonna be so cool. My partner and I did that too and we got like videos under water and we have like these, like, really cool fish.

12:12:38 Participant: So I just bought that, that came in the mail. I got it on Amazon, so I'm excited for that. Yeah, I just got to get good last minute stuff, definitely the bug spray though. I get attacked by mosquitoes. And I get boat sick so I need to get like the motion sickness pills. So I need to get a lot of those. Then some water activities are like everyday basically.

12:13:14 Coach: The other thing that I would recommend is a waterproof bag. So like an actual bag like a purse or backpack. Yeah, it kind of looks like a tube, and then you roll it up and then you clip it together. I can probably send you an Amazon link for that, just so that you kind of get an idea of what I'm talking about. But if you go on like a boat, they might provide it for you. But if you're doing other activities, it might just be helpful to have.

12:13:40 Participant: I didn't even know that existed. Like I'm taking a backpack, the little backpack is water resistant like it's like that windbreaker material, kind of, oh yeah, not waterproof.

12:14:05 Coach: Yeah, email me if you have any recommendations. I leave next weekend.

12:14:08 Participant: Yeah, I think it'll give you plenty of time to buy something. This one looks kind of nice. Oh, and it comes with... it comes with the case for the phone too.

12:14:22 Coach: Yeah, it's called a dry bag. Yeah, I'll send you a link anyways. I've been to Maui and Hawaii. But the one that I did like the most adventures stuff was the Big Island, Hawaii.

12:14:39 Participant: Yeah. I eventually want to go to all of them but yeah since my friend lives there I was like "okay we'll start there" and then work our way around.

12:14:49 Coach: Yeah, but I'm excited. You're gonna love it, you're gonna have a great time.

12:14:54 Participant: I know, I feel like the week's gonna go by so fast. Breakfast is kind of sporadic every day for me like I'm working so I'll either order something or I'll reheat leftovers or honestly lunch is kind of sporadic for me too like today I had real breakfast but I had like hummus and pretzels for lunch. Um, so yeah, I planned it out as lunch and dinner and I left like some space for breakfast to be kind of whatever it wants to be. I went to the grocery store last night and I did buy a couple of breakfast things that I'm like looking forward to having. This breakfast place near my grandparents house had these really awesome breakfast sandwiches that had like sriracha mayo and grilled onions on them. And I was like I can make that so I bought like sriracha mayo and hamburger buns. So like that's one of the things that like all I have to do when I'm craving it basically. So I planned out lunch and dinner and I left some spots for like leftovers and then I left like Saturday I know I'll be out with a friend so like planned on going out that evening, and then Tuesday for my sister's birthday planned on going out that evening. So I plotted in some like flexibility with eating out or eating leftovers or kind of eating whatever. I already kind of botched what I was going to have for lunch today, um, but like, that's okay the dinner plan today matters more for me. I also like need to cook some chicken that's about to go bad in my fridge. And so I planned to cook it tonight to eat it like for lunch tomorrow, and then to make like a chicken parmesan thing with it over the weekend, I think. So like planning ahead to not like throwing out, you know, two pounds of chicken.

18:59:35 Coach: So, um, the way that we're going to measure this, how do you want to measure this?

18:59:41 Participant: So I've got it written down it's like on like a weekly planner sheet, and I was just gonna like check them off, honestly, um, so just being like, it's two meals a day, times the next seven days basically so like I'll stick to 10 of the meals, and really just like checklist it off so I was gonna probably magnet it to my fridge or something and it's very manual it's like pen and paper.

19:00:14 Coach: The other thing I was thinking of, because I know you mentioned like sending the photos or like me asking for the photos. You can say like, you can text me like a photo of the meal that you made, or ate. For example like you know you're making the chicken tonight so you'll be like, this is the chicken or actually, it might make more sense if you send it to me like before you ate it.

19:00:41 Participant: Like, this is my empty plate, but it was a meal off the meal plan.

19:00:50 Coach: That sounds like a good idea. Um, the other thing I was going to suggest is you can send me a photo of your meal plan too so that way I can be like hey, you were planning on eating this time. You're looking over your sandwich.

19:01:10 Participant: Yeah, that works right now but awesome.

19:01:16 Coach: Okay. And so it's attainable. And we're measuring it. And then the relevant piece, just some things that you highlighted in the beginning, or like not wanting to be wasteful. Um, what are other reasons, or why is this important to you?

19:01:43 Participant: Yeah. One of the things I'm making this week is like knock off Chick-fil-A sandwiches. So like, not spending money at Chick-fil-A is important to me. So I'm like I need to eat this chicken. There's no really ideal, I'm looking forward to eating this chicken like I'm not craving like chicken and vegetables or whatever but I was like if I could make it like, not necessarily fun but like something that I crave and not give Chick-fil-A my money like, that's kind of it, like two birds one stone. Um, yeah. Money is a factor in some of it's like money I already spent so like I already spent all this money on like the Hello Fresh kit and groceries and so to throw it out would be a waste of that money but also to order delivery out of my own pocket for the next week would be a waste of my money. Yeah. And just to kind of make better use of my time I think like right now I told myself like oh I don't have time to cook and after work I'm like I just want to crawl into bed and watch TV but if I'm looking at it I'm like oh I'm just going to take 20 minutes to prep this and pop it in the oven or whatever. I need to make like next week for example I need to make a lasagna for an event anyway and so I was going to like make one to give and then like make myself a small one like for my own dinner on Monday. So like two birds one stone, really. So, time management, money management, not being wasteful.

19:03:38 Coach: I think time management and money management are really relevant to health, but would cooking at home or following your meal plan benefit you in other ways health wise?

19:03:53 Participant: Yeah, that's a good question. I think so, I think it's just like healthier alternatives so like I said with this sandwich that I'm craving like if I make it at home it's probably like four or 500 or 600 calories if I go out and buy it, it's probably like eight, nine, 1000 calories. Same with several of these like the Chick-fil-A sandwich you know I'm like, I'm going to coat it with like milk, eggs and flour and then put it in the air fryer instead of like deep frying it so it's healthier. So like the cooking style is different too. Yeah, more control maybe. Definitely, yeah more control. I like cooking too I think it's like, I don't know if soothing is the right word but it's like something that I enjoy doing and I know that I enjoy doing it, even when I'm like trying to avoid doing it because I'm tired. And so I know it makes me feel like happy, or good or whatever. I'm cleaning up not so much so I'm like kind of dreading that but that's okay. Um, so yeah I think I think it has health benefits I think that those matter but I don't think that they're like the primary motivators here, especially like this week.

19:05:25 Coach: Yeah, I think it's good to be mindful of that and also, we'll check in next week to see like, like just a reflection of it essentially. Okay, so sorry my scale question is coming back, on a scale of one to ten what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

19:05:56 Participant: Um. The one thing I was gonna say was like, there are some days when I might mix it up like I might eat tomorrow's dinner today and today's dinner tomorrow and I want to like kind of give myself the space to do that without like saying that I failed, you know, so I'm looking at it more holistically, more like 10 of these meals out of the next 14 instead of like one of the next one to out the next two you know. And so I think like with that in mind, I'm pretty confident like probably a seven, that if I felt like I was trapped in by it I think that would make it more difficult because I would say like, oh man, I'm really supposed to cook that steak tonight but I really really just want sushi, you know, whereas if I said like, oh, I can cook the steak tomorrow and just have leftovers today like that would make it a little bit more attainable and give me a little bit more control and flexibility so, yeah.

19:06:52 Coach: So I'll change the goal to say like in the next week you will follow your meal plan for 10 meals out of 14 meals.

19:07:04 Participant: It's worded a little differently but we'll know what we mean.

19:07:11 Coach: Um, and then was there anything I can do to support this goal?

19:07:16 Participant: I think you already mentioned them so just like I can send pictures, you can, yeah, just checking in, positive feedback like those sorts of things.

19:07:42 Coach: Um, so I will send you an email with all of these. Um, and then I'll check in with you later. One question that's related to next week's appointment. I'm not available on Thursday, I like accidentally messed up my schedule. And so I was gonna see if you were available either Wednesday or Friday.

19:08:07 Participant: Both are rough. On Wednesday I have class so it's just kind of always a struggle and then Friday I have an early morning flight, and I'll be with my family all day. So, I couldn't do either. Monday?

19:08:24 Coach: Monday early morning, would you want to do Monday evening?

19:08:33 Participant: I could. Yeah, I could do like early evening. I typically have a call with my therapist at 7:30 so I could do like the five or six o'clock hours.

19:08:45 Coach: Okay. Yeah, let's do 5:15, be okay?

19:08:49 Participant: Yeah. On May 3rd?

19:08:56 Coach: Um, I think it might like mess up your text message schedule a little bit, but I don't think we're like too far off like your text messages end on Sunday and then we would meet Monday.

19:09:07 Participant: Okay, or something like that, something to that effect. Yeah, no problem.

19:09:13 Coach: So, I'll send you this. And hopefully you do get notified to your email.

19:09:21 Participant: Yeah, yeah, hopefully, we'll see. It's the same Zoom link anyway right?

19:09:32 Coach: Totally. Just copy that from today's just in case. Well, thank you for meeting with me, and I hope you have a good week. Good luck with your health goals, drink a lot of water, and I will see you next Monday. Next Monday. Yeah, like 10 days from now.

19:09:56 Participant: Yeah.
