17:58:50 Coach: Hello, how are you today?

17:58:54 Participant: Good.

17:58:57 Coach: It's almost the middle of the week so we're getting there. It's my last day of classes today. So how are you feeling, overwhelmed?

17:59:09 Participant: My first finals on Monday, so I need to study.

17:59:14 Coach: So there's a lot coming up this week. Today is also our last coaching session. So towards the end of today, after we go over sort of how things went for the week, I'll give you a bit more information about what are some of the next steps now that you've completed the four sessions with me. And I believe that text messages will end sometime this weekend too, just so you know. And I mean, you'll have them on your phone - they won't disappear - but you won't be getting new ones, right.

17:59:49 Coach: So how did you do on meeting your goals this last week? The meditation and taking breaks.

17:59:59 Participant: I did okay. Okay, um, I don't think I quite met the five day goal but I did, I did do it. You know I've been, I've been doing it. I have been making it a practice to set aside time to meditate, and then taking time between classes to just relax. And it was strange too because I might have done the five days honestly. I didn't really track it, but it was strange because it's just like allowing myself to take like even just the 15 minutes was just like more stressful than I thought it was going to be. Because, you know just, and I never really considered myself a busy body but I guess I am because I just was like, you know, I should be doing this. Like there's so much stuff that I need to get done. Like what am I doing just sitting here? Like I have, you know, I was so mad at my mom growing up because she was that way too. Like she wouldn't be able to focus unless the house was like a certain way and then now I'm turning into that too.

18:01:04 Coach: And myself. And so turning off our mind sometimes is actually more difficult than we then we realized. I mean, especially because you do have quite a few things you want to get done. But knowing that you need to give your mind that mental break, it's really important too. So on a scale of one to 10, how well did you think you did with your goal this last week?

18:01:43 Participant: I would say like an eight. Okay. I was like right there. Like if it wasn't five, all five days, it was like four or more than five days.

18:01:55 Coach: That's good. And how about stress wise, how would you say your stress level was this week on a scale of one to ten? I mean, this week isn't a very good indicator just because it's the last week of classes, you know, but I would say probably about like a six. Yeah, it's definitely a different type of situation. But it all averages out right once we see it all together. So, right. So you were able to do most days for the meditation and taking that mental break. And what are you hoping to be able to check in about today? And also thinking about the fact that today would be the last coaching session, and how can we create either a goal or think about skills that you will continue to use moving forward to help you manage your health and your wellbeing?

18:03:00 Participant: Honestly, I don't know. I didn't, I wasn't expecting since it was our last session. I wasn't thinking about what goals I wanted to set after this. I was more thinking about just like keeping the consistency and trying to continue some like the habits that I've developed. Like I really like the variety in my diet, like adding more things in, you know, coming up with different ways to put more fruits and vegetables into my diet. And then the harder ones is, you know, cutting down on the takeout. But I've already like started to try and work on that. So like Tuesdays and I'm not going to have the problem anymore because I'm not in class, but like Tuesdays and Thursdays when I would have later classes, I would on Tuesdays I would make lasagna earlier in the day and then it can just be put in the oven. And I even added, and this is it's actually pretty good if you want to try it, I mixed in spinach with the meat. So added vegetables to the meal and I didn't have to worry about making a side or anything too. So it's just put a lot of spinach in with the meat and then everything else was like normal. And that worked out really well. And then just finding different like slow cooker meals for days when I know I'm going to be busy was nice. Like I did Campbell's Soup because I was like these sauce, like I know packages if you want to call it that. They're like they're easy slow cooker meals and the sauce comes in like this little pouch and you just add the meat. So you just put the meat in your slow cooker and the meat and vegetables if it calls for vegetables, and then you just put this sauce in and that's it. Or they have one pan meals which I did a couple times. Like they have like Thai chicken curry, which I'm not that confident in my own cooking skills, so to be able to just have that packet and put in and then just add the rice. And then I was like well how do I add vegetables? This was not just meat and rice. So you know, I put peas in with the with the rice and stuff so that it was a little bit more variety. And yeah, I really like that. I like coming up with ways to add variety to my diet so that things are a little bit more balanced. And I'm noticing improvement in I don't know if this is coincidental but I'm going to say it's related, that my skin has really improved. And so I yeah, I've noticed like my face has been a lot smoother and so in texture and I was like whoa, that's kind of like I don't know if that's from like my skin regimen but I haven't really changed it, but my diet has changed and so I think that that's affecting my skin, which is cool. I like that.

18:06:15 Coach: Those are definitely like the good side effects that are unexpected, right. So I know that you mentioned that in coming to today's session you really didn't think about goals that you could set, but it does sound like you want to be able to continue working on the goals that you've set throughout the previous weeks.

18:06:35 Participant: Yeah, just continue the good habits that have started to form.

18:06:40 Coach: Okay, yeah, I can still send you back a summary email with all the goals that you had set for yourself in the past, sort of so you have them all in one email. I think that might be helpful too.

18:06:56 Participant: I think the only thing that I would add is maybe I'd like more stretching, you know.

18:07:04 Participant: And I just say that and I don't know, I don't know how much I trust this doctor, which I know sounds weird, but like I had a ganglion cyst in my wrist, a bad one. And it had been there for like nine months and I went to a doctor and he straight up told me I can't drain it yet because it's not big enough or hard enough, but it'll either go away on its own or it'll get bigger and you can come back in and get it drained. Well, it didn't do either of those things. None of those things. It didn't get bigger, didn't get harder, it still hurt so it wasn't going away. So I went to this other doctor that I didn't really want to go see, but I didn't want to go through the process of getting a new primary care doctor and then getting a referral from that primary care doctor. I had already been seeing this doctor in San Francisco, and this was the guy that he referred me to for hand stuff and I already had seen him before because I have cubital tunnel syndrome. Really. No one seems to know what it is. Anyway, the doctor says carpal tunnel, the physical therapist says cubital tunnel. The guy at the this doctor ticks me off because he just wants me to stretch more. Like that's gonna fix it. And I'm like yes, okay, yes, stretching is going to make this go away that I've had for years and years. But anyway, same kind of thing happened when I went in again with this cyst. He's like oh well this is your body trying to say that you know, you've been stretching a little bit more, but it's not enough and so this is like your body's check engine light turning on. And I was like I don't know about that. And then he really, really made me angry because the audacity. Like I know I'm not a super skinny person, um, but he told me that you know one thing I should work on is adding mileage to my day. Like start if I'm going for walks, go on longer walks. If I'm working out, workout for longer. And I'm like dude, I work out for an hour a day, five to six days a week. Like I work out a lot. Like just because I don't exist in a skinny body doesn't mean that I'm not active and I really hated that. And then he said that basically I needed to be stretching and stretching at length is what I need. So I'll give it a shot. Like he makes me mad but I mean it's not gonna hurt me to be stretching more.

18:09:41 Coach: Yes, and I mean it sounds like the experience that you had is it's just a person that has a very set idea of what people should look like and not necessarily about like, it doesn't even have to be. He has a certain idea of what health looks like. He's still the hand doctor. Why is he talking to me about my mileage? Like no. I'm so sorry that you had to go through that.

18:10:08 Participant: Oh it just made me mad and I was like I am very physically fit. I work out a lot. It's how I cope with stuff. Like I enjoy it so I do it and I go for walks and. And he said, um, and he's like well you know you can just add mileage to the day. And I was like okay but when is working out too much? And he's like that doesn't exist. He goes that doesn't exist. You know, it's all, it is if you work out too much you just need length and stretching and then it'll go down, you'll get stronger and then you can go even longer. And I'm like dude, athletes get injuries because they overdo it.

18:10:54 Coach: I can't believe this person did that. But instruction is not a bad thing just because it's coming from an annoying person. So stretching is probably good. So in thinking about stretching, how much time do you think would be ideal to start with? Like five minutes? How many days during the week?

18:11:21 Participant: Five.

18:11:24 Coach: Five days. Is this something that you want to do in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening? What do you think about that?

18:11:38 Participant: Yeah, I think of it as the morning stretch, right?

18:11:44 Coach: Good, mornings work. After being in bed for a while, the body needs waking up.

18:11:52 Coach: And how confident do you feel about being able to do this?

18:11:56 Participant: Like I feel like I could do it. Like yeah, I could do that. Sure.

18:12:15 Participant: Okay, um, particularly adductor stretches, um, because I did have the so the first doctor that I went to, he said he couldn't drain my cyst yet. I did see him for knee pain. And because I was having knee pain when I was sedentary for too long, aching pain, and it was horrible because sitting in lecture halls for an hour to two hours, it was agonizing. I was like okay something's wrong. Like I've been putting up with this for too long. I'm going to go to the doctor, figure out what's going on. And he kind of narrowed it down to like it's mild fascial kind of imbalance. Like my adductors were way, way, way too tight and so it was pulling my kneecap out of the alignment that it needed to be in. And so I went to physical therapy to work on my adductor strength, and that was kind of how also kind of jump started a lot of my fitness was working on my adductor stuff, and then also strengthening my hips because he said that would really help as well. And so like good adductor stretches since those tend to get tight on me, I guess, so I can maintain that would be fantastic. Also hip stretches.

18:13:40 Coach: Yeah, the hips are important, especially and I know you're very young, but as women and as we get older, I think hips are like super important to maintain just for walking purposes. I don't know if you've ever seen this, but have you ever seen like older folks that when they walk they don't like step anymore, they kind of shuffle? And that has to do with like our flexibility in our joints and our hips. So just thinking about that really early on, it's really important. I work a lot with with an older population for fall prevention and they'll say a lot of the things that we've talked about, and we work in a memory care facility in Kentfield.

18:14:25 Participant: Where's Kentfield?

18:14:27 Coach: It's in the North Bay. It's in the Marin area. It's like by, you know, Corte Madera or San Rafael. Okay, I've been to San Rafael. Okay, not quite, like north of Sausalito. Small town.

18:15:00 Participant: Sounds familiar. That's right around there. It's cute. Tiny. You blink and you're out of the town.

18:15:06 Coach: I should be able to find some good stretching resources. Do you have any exercise apps?

18:15:14 Participant: Well yeah, I work out with the Apple Fitness Plus. I wonder if they have any stretching. They have like the mindful cool downs which does do stretching and I do that after every workout. And that's why I said like I do mini meditations because they have like the two, like four minute meditations with that. And then they have yoga but that's it. Okay, that's what it was. Someone told me that they have yoga and I'd heard of that. But okay, but I'll find you some other stretching related exercises that would be good.

18:15:52 Coach: Any other goals that you're thinking?

18:15:59 Participant: No. No. That's it. I'm good like where I'm at. I don't want to overwhelm myself with my habits that I'm trying to still build.

18:16:10 Coach: And yeah, and I think throughout the last three weeks you've made very good goals that you've kept up. And so in thinking about what you shared today, that you want to maintain that consistency. I think being able to continue with what you had before and gradually adding more like today we are talking about stretching, and weekly as you see how your goals are going, you can think about is there something new that I want to implement or do I just want to continue with what I have and maybe enhance it a little bit, or add a little bit more to that. I would say definitely think about the skills or the tools that have helped you moving forward. That way you can continue to use that as you go on. So for example, though, the weekly goal setting, if that's something that you find is actually helpful, then I definitely encourage you to set aside some time each week to set up some goals that you want to work on, especially related to health. That way you can continue and keep that consistency that you want to keep.
Any other successes that you want to share? And then you mentioned the skin, the glowing skin.

18:17:29 Participant: So I was like wow, my skin looks real good. I'm so happy. Um, no, I yeah, I just like that it's starting to kind of like I said, even just with the small goal of adding the blueberries to the oatmeal, it's starting to kind of bleed into other things. I really like that.

18:17:50 Coach: And so sometimes we just need one step to get us going. Nice domino effect. Yeah, absolutely. Are there any challenges that you are still having that you want us to talk through to maybe do some problem solving?

18:18:07 Participant: Just like I said, I didn't track very well with the meditation and stuff. I have been trying to do it and like keep myself accountable, but it's kind of like interesting because it's this fine line that I'm walking between keeping accountability but then like not wanting to make it a chore. Like this is supposed to be a relaxing thing to do and something to help me ground myself. I don't want it to be another thing on my list.

18:18:38 Coach: Yes, because the moment that you feel that it's another thing you have to do or another chore, I think that's when we start to lose that motivation and that consistency. So I totally agree with you. What are some ways that you can think of to address that? So when you start to feel that this is just becoming a bit of a chore, like what can spice it up so that you switch it up a bit?

18:19:08 Participant: I just tried different breathing techniques. Like, and then I think what I'll try and do is that instead of doing it after classes, especially because classes are ending now, maybe I'll do it after I'm done stretching and that's a nice way to kind of conclude that part of my day, that stretching session. I'm not only gonna call it that but, you know, just finding out when is the best place for it in my day and then what I like, what I'm going to get the most benefit from it.

18:19:48 Coach: Okay, you know, I think that's a good idea too in thinking about because the way that I'm hearing is that you want to associate it with something that you're doing, but it sort of becomes just part of a normal regular routine.

18:20:03 Participant: And I'm very much a creature of habit. I just thrive because I'm used to routine and find comfort in it. That's why I have oatmeal every day. So that's why it wasn't that big of a deal to put blueberries in my oatmeal or like why it wasn't a big deal to add carrots or whatever vegetable I have on hand to my lunch because I have the same thing for lunch every day because it's just easy when you're a student to do that and not have to think about it. And I think that's why I like routine in that way because it's something I don't have to think about. I don't have to decide it. Like dinner is a lot harder because it's like well, what am I going to do for dinner tonight? Yeah, I could very easily have the same thing for dinner every night. It's not that big of a deal. At least during the week. Weekends are a little different but during the week I don't care. I have other stuff on my mind. And as long as you eat something, that's sort of the most important thing at that point. I know it's sad too I guess because I like cooking. I like doing that kind of stuff. But when, like I said, when it becomes a chore, when you have to, when it's no longer fun and you like just need to get something so that you're eating something, like that's when it's like not exciting.

18:21:22 Coach: I think you have a very good goal for this week and I'll send you what you had before just so that you have a big summary of it. I do want to ask you about the text messages from this last week. Were there any that stood out to you, any message that motivated you to do something different?

18:21:58 Participant: I really liked the little photo, you know. I thought that was a really cute way to receive the advice. The one where it's like, you know, it's the time to spend time with family and cook a meal together, you know, make vegetable soup or turkey salad. Like I thought that was really cute. I liked the messages this week honestly. I thought they were really good. The bingo one was cute. It motivated you to want to do some self care. Yeah, I was like you know, yeah. Well, because it, that one was good because like I said it was, it's hard for me to stop, to slow down and so I was like, you know, it's okay. Like I need to just give myself permission to have this 15-20 minutes. It's 15-20 minutes isn't going to make or break me, at least if I'm not doing something, but it can like make or break me if I'm doing too much.

18:23:17 Coach: Yeah. Yeah. Remember that we do need a break, whether it's a mental break, a physical break, because that sort of helps us to reset and then keep moving forward. Yeah, I think it's good. You know because I was so I'm on the board of the moot court program for this next coming year in law school and we're interviewing you know first years and other, mostly first year, some second years to come and compete next year. And it's like so I think this program would be really good especially for the graduate students. Like masters and doctorate students, just because I know in my undergrad I was not this stressed, you know. But now that I'm in law school I am, and hearing these interviews with the other students, everyone is like yeah, I can't tell you how many people I've had tell me that they literally plan out every single moment of their day to the hour. Scheduling their meals, scheduling their free time. Like I'm just like oh my god.

18:24:37 Participant: And I do it too. I did it. I mean I did it to not quite to that extreme, but almost. I did it last year around this, especially during when the pandemic started. That helped me stay disciplined and I get that, but it's just like especially graduate students and I imagine it's this way for people in the master's programs and other doctorate programs. It's just you're going and going and going and it's just so much harder than undergrad. Good, so different. To have the reminders to take care of yourself is just so important because I know that I get burned out and I could feel myself getting burned out. Like we were talking about how I was just tired all the time and that's the first indication that I'm about to be like I'm done.

18:25:29 Coach: And how is that going this week? Because I know that's something that we talked about last week and we were trying to figure out ways to sort of address it by taking some breaks.

18:25:43 Participant: A lot better, although I did I have been falling off the wagon on doing my hour of studying for finals a night. I just haven't, but it's okay. I'm forgiving myself for that because you know I have this time now to do it. So yeah, it was awful and at that point it wasn't being helpful.

18:26:02 Coach: So now remember to be kind to yourself. I think we set our own expectations, right, so it's good to remind ourselves that we are human beings. We do as much as we can. And the idea of planning, yes, is very helpful, but just like we talked about with exercise, we can overdo the planning too and it causes more stress than it's needed. Hopefully it continues to get better. School will be somewhat over soon. Are you graduating this year?

18:26:32 Participant: No, next year. And I have a full summer and a full year next year, but I'm excited for this summer so I don't think it'll be too bad. So it'll be, it'll be okay. Yeah.

18:26:47 Coach: Okay, I think you are setting yourself up to definitely succeed and just remember to keep taking good care of yourself, which is very important. So let's see. So after today, I will send you a summary about the goals that you set just like before. As for next steps, you will be getting a few more text messages. I believe that you'll be getting them until this weekend. So please feel free to continue responding with your thoughts to them if you like. You are also going to get a link for like a final follow up survey. We should get that before the end of today. It's very similar to the one that you completed at the beginning, but this one should be a little shorter. It should be maybe 15 minutes instead of like 30 minutes. Because the last one was quite heavy. And once you complete that survey, we'll be reaching out to set up a follow up interview. But that's not going to be done by me. It'll be done by one of my other colleagues because they want to get sort of your unbiased opinion and they don't want me to influence the interview for research protocols, I guess you could call them. And ideally they want to do it around the same time where we would meet. So Wednesdays at six. Do you think that would work for you for next week? If you hold on, let me check because I know finals are coming up.

18:28:30 Participant: Oh yeah, that's fine. Yeah.

18:28:30 Coach: OK, so I'm going to tentatively book it for Wednesday at six. And that's May 5th. And then once you complete the survey, you'll get the final calendar invite with the link details. It will be a different link than the one that we've been using because someone else is coordinating the actual zoom interview for that. And just know that for that part of the interview, it might be a little longer, so it might be 40 to 60 minutes. That's sort of a heads up in case you need to plan for it. If it doesn't work, just let me know. We can figure out a better time. I'm hoping it's 40 minutes based on what we have left to do. But that should be coming up next week. So today I'll send you the survey. Just feel free to complete it as soon as you're able. That way you'll be able to sort of get it out of the way. Our main investigator does want the surveys to be completed before the interview. So just know that it should be completed before then. Do you have any questions? And I really want to thank you for participating in our program. It has been a pleasure to work with you and I mean I think you got it all down. I'm hoping that I was somewhat helpful in anything that you achieve and that you keep going. And just as we talked about, sometimes there's things in life that maybe are out of our control, but if we focus on the things that we have a connection to and that we can control, then that can help us to really manage our health and our wellness. So hopefully you've gained some skills. Continue using that goal setting that we talked about so you can continue to achieve your future goals. Take care. Best of luck with the rest of the semester and next year. 

18:30:53 Participant: But I am class of 2021. I want to graduate myself.

18:31:12 Coach: That's great. Yeah, great. Yeah. Thank you. Well, it's been, it's been really inspiring to see because we have 30 students that participated total, and everyone is from such a wide range of programs. Like we have law students, a few people that are in the psychology department or the psych PhD getting their doctorate or doing their masters. We have a few undergrads. It just makes me realize we're all struggling.

18:31:40 Participant: This is, you know, I was thinking about that the other day. Like I love that, I love that this program is like at least for the first launch was specifically for Latino students and like I love that.

18:31:50 Coach: Yeah. Hopefully we can keep it going. That's our goal right now. After we're done with this, our goal is to of course do all the reporting and summary of the data that we gather so we can get funding and be able to continue to provide it. So so thank you so much because you have contributed to that.

18:32:06 Participant: Thank you. I had a lot of fun and it actually has been very beneficial so it was great. And say hello to Luna.

18:32:17 Coach: Yeah. She's in the bath.
