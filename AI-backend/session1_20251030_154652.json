Between our weekly sessions, you'll be working on the goals we set together, and when we meet each week, we'll discuss your progress and adjust as needed. The program is really about helping you build sustainable habits that support your health and wellbeing in a way that feels right for you.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"
