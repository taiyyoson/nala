We'll meet for four sessions, once a week, over the next month. During our time together, we'll focus on your personal health goals, create actionable plans that fit your lifestyle, and use proven strategies to help you build lasting habits. Each week when we meet, we'll check in on your progress, celebrate your wins, and adjust our approach as needed to keep you moving forward.\n\nBetween our weekly sessions, you'll be working on the goals we set together, and you'll be responsible for tracking your own progress in whatever way works best for you.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"

That makes sense since you're already doing three days consistently.\n\nWhen you picture yourself walking for longer, how much longer are you thinking? For example, are you aiming for 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or something else?"

That's a solid 10-minute increase.\n\nTo make this goal really clear and achievable, let's add a timeframe. By when would you like to be walking for 30 minutes? Are you thinking by the end of this week, by our next session, or maybe gradually over the next few weeks?"

I love your enthusiasm.\n\nLet me make sure I have your complete goal right: You want to walk for 30 minutes, three times a week, by the end of this week. Is that accurate, or did you want to start with 30-minute walks just once or twice this week first?"

So your SMART goal is: Walk for 30 minutes, three times a week, by the end of this week.\n\nNow let's think about how you'll track this and hold yourself accountable between now and our next session. What method works best for you - maybe marking it on a calendar, using an app, setting phone reminders, or something else?"

You're feeling really confident at a 9 out of 10, and you'll be using phone reminders to track your progress. I'm excited to hear how your first week goes with your walks. Our next session will be in one week, and we'll talk about how everything went. Have a wonderful week, and I'll see you at Session 2!"
