During our time together, we'll work on setting personalized health goals that matter to you, and I'll support you with practical strategies to help you make lasting changes. Between our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and when we meet each week, we'll discuss your progress and adjust our approach as needed. Does that sound good to you, and do you have any questions about how the program works?"

Just to make sure this feels realistic for you - does adding 10 minutes to each walk feel achievable given your current schedule and energy levels?"

Since you're feeling so confident about this goal, I'm curious - are there any other health or wellness areas you'd like to work on during our time together, or would you like to focus solely on building your walking routine for now?"
