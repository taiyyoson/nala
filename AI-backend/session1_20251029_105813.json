We'll meet for four sessions, once a week, over the next four weeks. In each session, we'll work together on setting goals that matter to you, exploring what's working and what might need adjusting, and creating action steps you can take between our weekly meetings. My role is to support you, ask questions that help you reflect, and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\nBetween sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently. I encourage you to track your progress in whatever way works best for you, whether that's a journal, an app, or just notes on your phone.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"

Right now, \"I want to sleep more hours\" is a great starting point, but it needs a bit more detail to make it something you can really work toward and track. Specifically, it's missing how many hours you want to sleep, how often you want to hit that target, and what timeframe you're working within.\n\nFor example, you could reframe it as something like \"I want to sleep 8 hours per night, 5 nights per week, for the next 30 days\" or \"I want to increase my sleep from 6 to 7.5 hours per night within the next month.\"\n\nHow many hours of sleep per night would feel good to you, and how many nights per week do you think you could realistically aim for that?"

You'll know each week whether you're hitting those 4 nights of 8-hour sleep.\n\nDoes this goal feel realistic and achievable to you, given your current schedule and routine?"

That's a 2-hour increase, which is significant.\n\nGiven that homework is taking up so much of your time right now, do you think aiming for 8 hours every night this week is realistic, or would it make sense to start with something smaller that feels more doable with your current college workload?"
