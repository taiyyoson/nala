We'll meet once a week like this, and during our sessions, we'll work together on setting personalized goals, tracking your progress, and using strategies that really work for creating lasting change. Between our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and when we meet each week, we'll discuss how things went and adjust as needed.\n\nDoes that sound good to you?
