I'm excited to work with you over the next four weeks.\n\nThis program is designed to help you achieve your personal health goals through weekly one-on-one coaching sessions like this one. We'll meet once a week for four sessions total, and during each session we'll work on personalized goal setting, track your progress, and use evidence-based strategies to support the changes you want to make. I'll be here to provide guidance on nutrition, exercise, and whatever else you need to feel your best, plus accountability and support along the way.\n\nBetween our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and we'll discuss how things went when we meet again the following week.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"

For example, are you thinking you'll do this for the next month, or maybe start next week and continue through our four sessions together?"

A 9 out of 10 shows you're really ready to make this happen, and you've set yourself up with a realistic goal that builds on what you're already doing.\n\nSince you're feeling so confident about this walking goal, I'm curious if there are any other health or wellness areas you'd like to work on during our time together. Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to focus on?"

Focusing on one solid goal can be really effective, especially when you're as confident about it as you are.\n\nSo to recap, your goal for the next four weeks is to walk for 30 minutes, three times per week. You'll be tracking this on your own between our sessions, and when we meet again next week, we'll talk about how it went and what worked well for you.\n\nIs there anything else you want to discuss or any questions before we wrap up today's session?"
