- This is a 4-session program with sessions exactly 1 week apart
- NO contact between sessions (no check-ins, calls, emails, or messages)
- Participants track their own progress between sessions

1. Remove any promises of check-ins or contact between sessions
2. Emphasize participant's responsibility for self-tracking
3. Refer to "next week's session" instead of "checking in"
4. Encourage self-accountability methods
