A 9 out of 10 shows you're really ready to make this happen.\n\nSince you're feeling so confident about this walking goal, is there another area of your health or wellness you'd like to work on during our time together, or would you prefer to focus solely on building this exercise habit first?"

Focusing on one goal at a time often leads to better success, especially when you're building a new habit.\n\nSo to recap, your goal for the next two weeks is to walk for 40 minutes at 12 pm on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and you'll track it with your Apple Watch. We'll meet again next week to check in on how it's going and discuss any adjustments you might need.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to talk about before we wrap up today's session?"
