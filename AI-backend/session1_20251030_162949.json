I'm excited to work with you over the next four weeks.\n\nThis is a 4-week coaching program where we'll meet once a week for a session, just like this one. During our time together, we'll work on setting personalized health goals that matter to you, whether that's around nutrition, exercise, stress management, or other wellness areas. I'll help you create realistic action plans and we'll track your progress each week using evidence-based strategies that actually work.\n\nBetween our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and then we'll reconnect the following week to discuss how things went and adjust as needed. Do you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"

Right now your goal is pretty broad, so let's work together to make it more specific and measurable so we can actually track your progress.\n\nFor example, are you more concerned about getting more hours of sleep, improving the quality so you feel more rested, or maybe falling asleep faster or staying asleep through the night?

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Perfect, focusing on one goal is a great way to start.\n\nSo you'll be tracking your progress by noting each night whether you fell asleep within 30 minutes, and you'll use the audiobook with its 30-minute timer to help you achieve this. Does that sound right?"
