Between our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and when we meet each week, we'll discuss how things went and adjust as needed. Does that sound good to you?

A stronger goal would include specifics like how quickly you want to fall asleep, what steps you'll take to get there, and a timeframe to work within. For example, you might aim to reduce your time to fall asleep to under 20 minutes within the next few weeks by creating a consistent bedtime routine or cutting out screens before bed.

You rated your confidence at 8 out of 10, which is really strong. Over this next week, track how it goes each night so we can talk about your progress when we meet again. I'm excited to hear how your first week goes at Session 2 next week!"
