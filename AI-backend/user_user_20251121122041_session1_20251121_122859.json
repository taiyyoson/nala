Each week we'll work together to set personalized goals, explore what's working for you and what's not, and build strategies that fit your life. Between our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently, and then when we meet each week, we'll discuss your progress and adjust as needed. The focus is really on helping you create sustainable changes that work for you.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works?"

Remember to track your progress using your phone reminders and maybe note when you complete each walk. See you next week at Session 2."
