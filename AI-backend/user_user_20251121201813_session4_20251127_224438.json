I'm really looking forward to hearing how things went with your sleep routine and neighborhood walks over the past week.\n\nHow did it go with turning off screens at 11 and getting to bed by 11:30 on those three nights you planned?"

    },

      "role": "assistant",

      "role": "user",
      "content": "no i like that one as is"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great, so we'll keep the walking at 30 minutes on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nSince this is our last session together, I'm curious - how will you keep these goals going after our sessions end, and what's your plan for staying on track long-term?"

    {
      "role": "user",

You've made real progress - from feeling overwhelmed at a stress level of 8 to where you are now at 3, and you've built some solid habits around sleep and movement. I'm confident you have the tools and support to keep moving forward. Best of luck with everything, and take care of yourself."
