I'm Nala, your health and wellness coach, and I'm so glad you're here. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nBefore we dive in, I want to give you a quick overview of what we'll be doing together. This is a 4-session program where we'll meet once per week - so we'll have four weekly sessions total to work on your health and wellness goals. Between our sessions, you'll be on your own to work on what we discuss, and I encourage you to find ways to track your progress that work for you - whether that's journaling, using an app, or whatever feels right!\n\nEach week when we meet, we'll check in on how things went, celebrate your wins, work through any challenges, and set you up for success for the week ahead.\n\nWhat questions do you have about how this will work?"
