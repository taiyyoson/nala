"That's like the weirdest thing so it first started actually when I went to visit in San Francisco for some reason something weird happened with my contacts so I just took them out. And I noticed I was still seeing a little bit fuzzy and it took a while for my eyes to go back to normal. And then the next day I had like severe like photophobia like I couldn't be like in the sunlight and I, it wasn't a migraine headache because I didn't have a headache at all. It was really just like I, I couldn't be in the sunlight. And that was the only thing bothering me and then it would just staying consistently, and I just, it was, it was a it's really weird what was happening, and eventually like it resolved itself so I was like that for two days. And like I said I know it wasn't a migraine because migraine just was a feel like a headache. But I felt no headache or anything else like it literally was only my eyes and I didn't know what it was. And then I was like okay it's a one time thing no big deal. You know, and then of course later on I found out sometime that the symptom of like having an ulcer on your cornea. Because I went to the then this last time it happened when I was with. When I was shadowing that pediatrician. I noticed something happened afterwards and I was like okay maybe my eyes are just dry, so I put in like eyedrops, but that only made it worse. weird right. And I couldn't see again and it was just like it but I, my mom thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to like the stuff that the pediatrician was using at her at her house or something we don't know. But I also for like two days I couldn't like open my eyes are like look in certain directions because it was just like pain my eyes. And it was, it was weird and the like. And again the only reason why I was kind of fine afterwards because again we went out for dinner but that was like at night. So like, of course, like I didn't really sense much of the lighting, cuz we were seated outside and was like dim light. So again, like I didn't even realize and I thought okay maybe tomorrow. It'll be fine but no it was, it was awful. The next day, and I could only like look in certain directions. and they're like oh it's just like your sinus or something but I'm like, I don't think so. And then I like it's weird so I would like to the eye doctor of course on Monday cuz I was like we can take you to the ER and I'm like, I don't think you're a doctor is going to know what to do with eyes like they're probably going to be like, Oh, we don't know what's really wrong because again they don't do eyes they just do like physical body. You either included but there is like a specialty just for eyes and those special Just for like teeth. So, I wouldn't like if it was for my teeth I wouldn't really go to the ER for anything so like, same thing I thought for my eyes I was like no I know it's my eyes I need like an actual eye doctor. Sorry, go see him. And of course he started doing like rapid test and that's what he said he's like I just wanted to check you out really quickly because what you're experiencing it sounds like a corneal ulcer or something like corneal like issues, he's like, That's not good. So I just wanted to make sure it wasn't that and luckily it wasn't. But he didn't really know what it was either. So he told me to like again, kind of like, replace because they're soft contacts I know how you replace them like every month. So I just use it just replace them. And like, get a new case, I guess maybe in case the case had bacteria, and then I'm on antibiotics right now for my eyes because he's like, I don't know what it is but I just want to make sure like anything you could have just like flushed out and I go back on Monday to see like okay what's what's going on.","Again, I'm not like just based on a personal experience which is kind of similar. I became allergic to my contacts, like anytime I would put them in my eyes would just burn. Like, I'm not sure exactly what happened. But they ended up giving me like the one a day, so like the ones that like you throw in and throw out the same day, and then maybe do some like drops some stuff.

"Honestly like definitely sleep I feel like to start developing better sleep habits because I have atrocious sleep habits and I honestly just think it's because like in was in okay so like honestly like since I was in third grade I'd started waking up randomly throughout the night, and my mom used to having to keep this sleep journal literally just so we can keep track of how much I was sleeping because she noticed that I just like not sleeping all the way through. And then I got worse in high school because you know you do like morning sports like you have early morning practices. So I continuously wake up, you know before five in the morning because I had to be at school by six and I live like you know 40-45 minutes away from school. So I live far away so I would have to wake up earlier, and so sometimes if they want to like oh I'm gonna do 5:30 practice I'd have I'd have to be like, absolutely not. Absolutely not, I'm not going to do that to myself, because again. Sometimes you'd have double practices where you do you know an hour in the morning and then our in the afternoon. And that was just like, I mean I'm like I didn't like that, but I still want to do sports to keep myself busy, but like again. So my sleep habits were bad then. And then I would take trips sometimes like, you know, just a couple of times to like different countries and that was like, kind of like again jet lag. So, again, an odd sleeping schedule. And then I go to San Francisco which is again, you know it's only two hours but two hours kind of makes a difference when you're waking up in the morning and when you're going to bed like that, that makes that makes a difference.

"Thank you. Um, I’m not too sure. The one thing I’ve been really bad at lately is eating breakfast. I honestly don’t like breakfast food, and I don’t have much of an appetite in the morning. But I wake up starving—like my stomach growls off the charts—while at the same time my brain is like, “You don’t want any of this food.” So I think I want to work on being more consistent with eating breakfast. Even if it’s just a bar or a bowl of cereal. Because I’ve noticed if I don’t eat breakfast, the rest of my eating patterns for the day get completely thrown off.","Yes. I don’t know if you’ve heard this before, but let’s frame this around energy levels. A lot of programs talk about weight and weight management, but really, this is about fueling your body. You’ve been fasting 6–8 hours depending on how long you sleep, so your body needs something in the morning. What you give it doesn’t have to be complicated, as long as it’s somewhat nutritious.

I don’t know how to shift my mindset to be healthier and less like, “I’ll just eat whatever’s in front of me.”","Okay, let’s brainstorm some ideas that feel like a treat but are healthier. For example, I’ve heard of cutting up apples, sprinkling cinnamon on them, and baking them in the oven. People say it makes them taste like dessert.

And then the second part is the health coaching and so that's what we're here today to do. And my role as your health coach, I'll meet with you once a week through Zoom for about 20 minutes. I can meet with you a little bit longer if that's something that you're interested in, but I want to be mindful of your time. And then also, I'll check in with you, um, through text message in between our sessions just to check in on your progress and to see if there's anything that I can do. Um, if any questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise as a health coach, I'll let you know, and get you connected to the appropriate resource. So one example could be maybe you're interested in getting connected to therapy to like support your mental health. I'm not a therapist, and so I'll let you know like, hey, unfortunately, I'm not a therapist, but I can help you get connected to one. Yeah. And the other important factor about this is that this is a research study and we will be collecting data, but our specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be de-identified, so your name and like what we work on will be separate. So I just want to let you know that so you can be mindful about how much you share and it's within your comfort zone. By the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around, problem solving and goal setting, as a way to feel empowered about your physical, mental and - sorry - spiritual mental and physical health, those are the three, and then beyond this program.

"Perfect, thank you so much. Thank you.","So one of the things we should close some of these windows so I can have more space. So as you've noticed, the EXAMEN intervention is sort of a two part project. One aspect is the health and wellness text messages, which you are receiving already, and you should be getting those daily. And the second part of it is the health coaching so meeting one on one with me. My role as your health coach will be meeting once a week for at least 20 minutes. If we need more time then we can definitely work that out. I usually schedule each session for 30 minutes just in case anything comes up. During that time, we'll check in about the daily text messages, what your thoughts have been on them, if any of them have motivated you to do any of the activities or suggestions. We'll talk about weekly goals that we're going to set. And I'll tell you a bit more about that later. And I'll also be asking you about your stress level and sort of how stressed you feel from week to week, and I will be following up with you through text messages in between our sessions just to see how things are going and get an idea of how you're progressing. If at any point there's questions or topics that come up that I feel are outside of my scope of expertise as a health coach, I will let you know and that way I can help you to get connected to appropriate resources. So this is a research study, yes, as you might have noticed with all the paperwork that you had to fill out. Thank you so much for doing that. However, while we're going to collect data, any specific conversations will be kept confidential and any data that we do gather or transcripts will be de-identified, so they won't be associated with your name. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. By the end of the four weeks, we do hope that you gain skills around problem solving, goal setting as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual, your mental and your physical health. So I really want to thank you for taking the time to participate in this program.

So before I jump into the messages themselves, I do want to ask you, tell me a little bit more about yourself, and also what are you hoping to check in about today?

"So a little bit about myself. I'm finishing my master's degree right now in environmental management. And that's my second degree at USF. My first one was a Bachelor's in international studies. I'm right now, you know, I'm finishing this masters and wondering where I should go work wise, career wise, more education. So, you know, I can see the end of the chapter and the stress levels are increasing, because, um, well on the one hand I need to make sure that the thesis is done and ready in the next month. So I was diagnosed with diabetes type one, that was six years ago already. And it has an impact on, you know, well, how much I care, how much I think about my health on a daily basis. And so I've learned a lot, but there are some areas where consistency is missing. So let's say that I feel fine. I mean, you know, good days, oh I don't need these tools. And then when everything comes up, and I think, oh, when was the last time I took 20 minutes to meditate or, you know, so it's this game of you know getting into the flow and out of the flow, and I think we all do that cycle. And so what I really hope to achieve, you know, in these next four weeks is this consistency, right? To have, to establish a routine and a routine of non-negotiables because, you know, we don't think about oh let's get a shower, let's eat. But, hey let's check in with myself, where am I at. What really attracted me in the language that you used as part of the research, you know, the questions. The first questions that I received was about the spiritual, and I thought that was really interesting because I'm constantly thinking about my health and what I eat and how much I move and if I you know had enough exercise. But the spiritual side is so important to me and somehow it just went into, you know, that section of like, oh, perhaps it is the full moon, I remember, reconnect. Right, yeah. You get the picture.","Now I totally get it. I actually think it's something that especially as Latina women we tend to be very conflicted about. Either we are at one extreme of spirituality or at the other. And I really want to make sure that during this program, our goal is not really to move you to one extreme or the other. It's really to find a middle ground that helps you stay grounded and that helps your well being. And so the idea of EXAMEN itself comes from like the Jesuit tradition to stop and reflect on where we are and where we want to go, and also how do we impact the world around us as human beings right? And being mindful and present, but also how do we help our community at the same time in those areas. So I think you do bring up a great point that at times, spirituality sort of just gets left behind. And it's not necessarily a bad thing. There's a lot of other things that we want to focus on, but learning to maybe weave it into the things that we do on a daily basis can really help us to sort of keep it all together, right?",goal_setting,nutrition,7,little bit about myself finishing master degree right,Edited EXAMEN092 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

"All those questions with numbers are the most difficult to answer, because I think it's a flow, right, it's a flow of in and out. I think there are parts of the day where I feel more stress than others. You know, typically I'm not going to be stressed in the morning. I wake up and I do my thing so I get into, you know, the mindset of what needs to be done. But I would say that I have moments in the day where I have peaks of stress, and those could be categorized you know between seven and 10. And then I have a couple of moments in the day, which are fewer, but I do have moments where I'm 100% present and in the moment.

Um, my dad does the same thing. So when I don't approach him, or I tell him ahead of time, he'll listen and he won't talk to me and won't act like I'm not there and I like that. I tried to tell my mom this and she doesn't believe in that. So, she's the one that bugs me more she's the one that doesn't get it.

"I like, I like those ideas. I'm actually really bad at setting boundaries. I'm not really good at it. I've talked to my - it's got me into trouble a couple times. Actually, I talked to my friend and her friend's like you don't set boundaries and I was like well I think I am and then she's like no you say it and then when someone pushes the boundary you kind of let them break the boundary you don't set boundary. And I was like, I told them, she's like, but if they don't respect it you need to reinforce it to make it an actual boundary. So, like, it's just like hard for me because I don't really understand how to set a boundary, or even like where to set the boundary.","Mm hmm. So think of, like, two circles like the small circle and the big circle - like this first circle is like what you're comfortable with where you feel safety, where you feel happy where you feel like good about yourself and the things, and the people around you, and the next circle is like that kind of uncomfortable zone where you're like, oh, that kind of stinks like like that. I didn't like, I'm not comfortable, but that kind of just like, isn't in my comfort zone. So you mentioned, like needing your personal space but your personal space not being respected. After you've said, like, you need space. So that's a time where, like, you want to reinforce the boundary and say like, this is what I'm comfortable with and this is what I'm needing, you're kind of like pushing me into that red zone and I don't want to go there.

Same thing with my clothes like I'd be happy to let you borrow clothes, I just need you to ask. I have a sister, by the way, so that's where that one comes from. Yes, yes. And so it, the boundaries can look different ways and you can apply them to yeah just different aspects of your life.

"Yes, yes.","Yeah. And the second part is the health coaching. So my role as your health coach is to meet with you once a week. And that's, you know, we can do that through Zoom or over the phone. The goal is to do at least 20 minutes. And during this time we can check in about the daily text messages, what has been your thoughts on those, any goals that you have related to health and wellness. I'll also be asking you about stress level and how you're feeling about stress in this last week. And then we'll also go over just any other questions that you have. During the week, I'll check in with you to see how your progress is going. And if you have any questions or topics that come up during our sessions that I feel might be outside of my scope of work or expertise as your health coach, I will let you know what those limitations are and also connect you with appropriate resources. So this, as you know, this is a research study and we hope that we're able to collect a lot of useful data. However, any specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data that we gather will be sort of more aggregate data and de-identified. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing with us, or with me. By the end of the four weeks, we hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, as a way to help you manage any physical health goals, maybe spiritual or mental health goals that you also have. So we really want to thank you for choosing to participate in this program and we really hope that this program itself is going to help us to be able to figure out what are the needs of students and how we can provide them resources that can really benefit them.

"Yeah, I mean I think overall it's just like perfect timing because I've been kind of having a little bit of like breathing problems that kind of... I wouldn't say heart problems because I haven't like officially gotten tested but you know I've been to the hospital sometimes and that kind of just made me realize that every time that I drink like any sugary drinks or that I eat, you know something that's like super spicy or that's not as healthy as I would hope it to be, then my heart like just increases a little bit. So the doctors have, in the meantime that I get tested and all that, they like kind of told me to stay away from any sugary drinks or you know those things. And I think for me, I love like sugary drinks and kind of snacks and things like that. So, I think I had to kind of take a step back and look at my stress levels, and also kind of my eating habits and then I need to make better choices with eating habits. And then now that I kind of moved, the big component is I think that I can eat healthier now because I'm going to have to be cooking all the time and you know I can do like food prep or something like that. And I think just the overall experience of moving out, it's like exciting. So I'm thinking like this could be kind of a start to me eating a little healthier, and just having a better, healthier living style than I kind of was before.

In thinking about where you are today, and where you want to move forward, I would just say don't think about what is recommended or what is healthy, think about what is feasible for you to start with, and gradually add a little bit more, because that's what's going to make you successful. You want to set yourself up to succeed in your goal so I would say if right now, you're not drinking any water, let's say you're drinking one water bottle a day, then adding two more and having three water bottles, that's great progress.

I think especially in thinking of everything that you have going on, setting at least one goal is very generous to start with.

"Yeah I guess like starting with the positive, like I kind of have set myself before where, you know, I start exercising, and I start eating better. Like I've tried doing meal prep for a while, and this was like maybe four years ago. I do remember that I was like pretty healthy in the way that I would go to the gym very often or just even do some sort of exercising. And then also, just kind of like eating healthier. And that just kind of not only made me look a little healthier but also feel healthier. And I think part of it was that I had kind of some friends to go with and then now with, you know, COVID I kind of totally forgot to do even exercise or do all that. And I've been, you know, just being honest, plateauing, and then kind of just... There's been some positives where I knew what kind of worked for me, and then I felt healthier. And the other part of it that you asked was, what hasn't worked for me, right? I think just liking some sort of food more than I should. Like I love soda, and that's always been like my thing since I was a child. Like I just love Coke. Like I just love Coke and that's one of the worst things that you can drink so every time I go to like a restaurant, I would order like a soda or sometimes if we try not to have soda at the house just because you know I'd be drinking it with every meal, but like when we do have a party or we do end up having soda, I'll always drink that and I'll pick that always over water. So I feel like that has been kind of like an always situation where it's like, ""Oh, where is the soda,"" and then kind of just, I guess kind of going back to, preferring like not healthy choices like if I were to be at a party where there's like salads and then there's like other foods like I'd rather eat the other food versus like eating like salad or, you know, the healthier option. I think that kind of has, you know, I feel, especially with COVID. Now I've just been trying to... I think I feel like I just choose the unhealthy option more than the healthy option.","Sometimes it's just what's available but also what we are inclined to make certain choices over others, and I think all the things that you mentioned are really related to just the habits that we developed over time, right? If, for example, soda has been something that's been part of your life since you were a child, trying to change that all of a sudden, it's going to take some time. And also the idea that there's healthy foods, and there's also foods that we should have in moderation. That's how I like to think about it so that we don't create this idea of ""these foods are like bad for me."" They're just not as beneficial for them. Right?Yeah. So, I think you bring up great points about the things that you want to work on. So I'll make some notes so that as we move forward in the next sessions, we could think of, do you want to set a goal around... For example, working on, and I think you're already doing that, drinking more water, which can work to substitute some soda intake, at least for part of the time, right? I want to make sure that you also think about how can you still enjoy the things that you like to eat.

Just because like my body's stress response is just to kind of shut down. So like I get really, really tired for no reason, and it doesn't matter how much I sleep, I'm still exhausted. Like on Tuesday, I ended up - I slept a full night, you know, at least like six to seven hours, and I got up and I made myself breakfast and I fell asleep after breakfast on the couch.

With that being said, if any questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise, I'll let you know about the limitations in my knowledge, and then can help you get connected to the appropriate resource.

So like for me like in high school and even as a kid I was never allowed to like eat certain like sugary foods or processed foods because my parents were like, ""no, don't eat that"" like it was really fresh. So when I finally got to college, I was like, ""I can eat this stuff."" So I gained a lot of weight, and then the issue was that I was always used to continuously working out because I did sports in high school, and even in middle school. So I realized I didn't have sports to balance out my eating like I did before. So since then it's kind of like, been a journey of just kind of like getting back into shape, like how I was like before. I guess now more recently because I've been getting busier now that I started work and I used to start working like in the past years also after freshman year, it's a little bit harder to maintain like continuously working out because you're tired, you don't feel like waking up so early because you're also tired from classes. And then now it's kind of just like with COVID I feel like more sluggish. Just because everything seems to be going really slowly and everything's all online it's like, it's a little bit harder to get out sometimes. So that's why I wanted to do this because I was like, ""Oh, it'd be a good way of just like getting an extra reminder from, like, you know, besides myself just like, do something."" That way I can stick with working out continuously because I start doing it and then I have trouble following through with it because then I get tired.","I wonder too if like how you're saying the current situation, the current status of our world is impacting your energy and motivation or determination to continue with the goal that you've set for yourself. So tell me a little bit about, like, the goal that you did have, for example, you mentioned like you were working out. Like what did that include for you?",goal_setting,nutrition,7,kind goes tied back freshman year college when,Edited meeting_saved_closed_caption - Jazmin Jauregui(11).txt
"For me, it was just a way to also just get out stress. I'm a very physical person like I have to do something in order to really work out my stress and then also like any anxiety. And so, like my main goal is just to like be more active in general, like whether that's, you know, doing more actual physical working out or you know have a set routine with what I do like certain workouts, or even just to like get more outside and wander around the yard, like my dad. He literally put on his to-do list ""walk around"" and I'm like ""why do you put that?"" he's like ""because you have to always walk around a little bit."" So he literally like gets up from his like workstation and he'll just walk around the whole yard, like a few times and then he'll come back in and go back to typing and it's like ""check."" Yeah, like when he puts it in there twice. Okay, make sure that he goes multiple times. So I've started recently doing that too, because like you know like it's been... inside sometimes you don't get that natural sunlight. And then when you go outside you kind of like, ""oh the sunlight"" kind of makes me feel a little bit happier.","Vitamin D. It's a thing. Yeah, like I kind of didn't really believe it as much and then now that I'm like ""oh I was..."" there was really... that was really helpful. Okay, cool. And so I'm hearing a couple ideas and I'm just going to reflect that back to you and you let me know whether you want to create one goal or two goals around the things that you've mentioned. So I've heard that like being physical helps you alleviate some of your stress and some of your anxiety, and then you've faced some challenges before in keeping the routine. But it's still important to you to like, maybe do something around there. And then I'm also hearing that like being outside or going for a walk outside can be something that you need in your life and want to incorporate. Just even a little bit of sun makes you so much happier, like that's powerful stuff. So, and then also earlier you had mentioned around eating more vegetables and, like, I'm hearing a lot about physical activity.

"All of those things like I like the idea of both just to like, also help with my eating because like that's also a big part of like, making sure that you feel good when you work out.","So, let me tell you a little bit about the way that I format the goals, and then you can tell me kind of fill in the blank. So, we use the approach of SMART goals which stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. For this program, we keep the timely part to a week. So ""in a week, I will"" and then you want to be specific, ""go on a 10 minute bike ride for three of the four"" or ""three of the five days,"" or ""four or five out of the seven days"" so that's just one example. And so even if you say like ""I'm going to exercise,"" I'd want us to be more specific, for example, ""I'm going to go on a 20 minute run,"" or ""I'm going to lift weights three times, do three reps with 10 pounds"" like make it as specific as possible, and then...

So you are welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. And we want to make sure that this is a safe environment for you and that you feel open to share your thoughts.

I guess my biggest goal or biggest thing right now is, do I have to have like certain, a certain level of like, you know, have already like a goal or be already like in the maintenance stage or something or is it kind of like not necessary?","No. So every week, I do an assessment of where we are with goals, and the goal is to prepare you and get you thinking about things. You could be at any of those stages. Maybe you're in preparation, maybe you're in pre contemplation, maybe you're just thinking about it. And the goal during our sessions is to get you to actually set a goal on what you want to do. So if you've been thinking about something we'll set a goal, we'll make it measurable, we'll make it specific, so that you're able to achieve that during the week. And if you think you really want to start to eat healthier for example, but you really don't know where to start, maybe the first step is to do some research about what it would be like a proper meal plan for you, for example, or maybe meet with a registered dietitian so they could guide you through what would be a good start. Or if you know, Okay, I know that I want to incorporate, I don't know, more vegetables to my meals, then that's something that we can talk about and figure out how do we do that. You don't need to be in action mode now. If anything, we want you to be ready for that so that we can talk about how do we get you to action.

It was, you know, eating healthier, being a little more, you know I want to exercise more. I think because of the pandemic it's something that I, I've just I stopped you know and it's, I am not doing like anything right now so it's, I've already had been thinking of it, you know with meal prepping some weeks and not others.

So in thinking about that piece, we do want to set a SMART goal around it and I'm sure you might be familiar with the term. So we want to make it specific, we want to make it measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. So at this point, you've set an appointment.

I started looking into what’s available around the SF area and I found this super cool outdoor yoga class. You do it with headphones on—it’s like music-based. It’s called Silent Disco Yoga. It’s at Ocean Beach, just five minutes from me. Everyone brings their own mat, you get sanitized headphones, and it’s open to all levels. I always knew it was there, but I was never confident enough to try. Yoga sounds easy, but it’s not—it takes balance and strength. But now I feel more confident, so I think I’m going to book a class and maybe ask a friend to come. Or maybe I’ll go alone just to see how it feels. Having a buddy might make it easier.","Okay, definitely. Having a buddy can make it more powerful and motivating.

At first I wasn’t sure, but then I thought—it could help me save money. I’ll be living in Mexico for two months this summer, so having extra cushion money would help. I told them I could only work Fridays or Saturdays, maybe two times a month, just to keep boundaries. They agreed. So I’ll be working this weekend—Friday and Saturday.

But the way I started off with coffee was Starbucks, caramel frappuccinos. And I just knew it was so unhealthy, with all the whipped cream and caramel, but that was what I thought coffee was at that time. And then one of my friends was like, “You could get a drink that’s similar to a caramel macchiato but a little healthier.” Like substitute the milk, or add different options. I tried it, and I really liked it. Ever since then, I’ve slowly transitioned out of whole milk to almond milk, oat milk, and soy milk. My family are big dairy people, so it’s everywhere, but I’ve become more aware—like how it can be healthier to not get a frappuccino with whipped cream, but just have a good coffee with a substitute creamer.

I used to write notes about how low my confidence was. I hated how I thought of myself then. Now I’d never tolerate people treating me that way—or me treating myself that way.

And I know that I'm more successful on those days than on the ones where I let myself stay in bed until 10 or 11. So, I think it's going to be hard, I think. I think three days like yes definitely I could do that I think four days would be a challenge I don't think it would be impossible.

Like, we can say like, either way you were still really successful in this yeah like that let's lean into that, what made it to where, like, what, Why were you successful in this goal but not this goal. And so it'll help us evaluate it, and not lumped together because I think that's oftentimes we do lump so many things together and we're like, oh, we failed like I didn't do this and I didn't do that and we get overwhelmed.

Before we get into like the health coaching part of it I just have a brief introduction, just so that you're well informed about what to expect in our sessions. So the research project is a two part intervention. One is the text messages which you should be receiving already. And then the second part is the health coaching. So as your health coach, we will meet about once a week for about 30 minutes to talk about your health goals, and how you go about achieving them. I'll also check in with you about the text messages and your stress level. And then after each health coaching session, I do check in with you through text message here and there just to see if you're needing any support. If questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope as a health coach, I'll let you know about the limitations in my knowledge or experience and refer you to the appropriate resource. So one example of this could be like, if you want to focus on your mental health. I'm not a therapist but you know you can get connected with CAPS and I can provide that referral to you.

So I'll start just by giving you a little introduction about the program itself, and sort of what we're going to be working on today. How does that sound? Good. Well my name is Eddie Gallagher, and I'm going to be your health coach for the next four weeks. As you've noticed, this is a two-part intervention. One aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving. The other part is to meet with a health coach—that will be me. My role is to check in with you for at least 20 minutes. If we need more time, that’s totally fine. During that time, the goal is to check in with each other. I'll be asking you about the messages to get your input on what is making a difference—whether some are motivating you to do things, or they’re just nice but not really changing anything. The other part is goal setting. We want to work with you to get your thoughts on what goals you want to work on, and together we’ll make them achievable within a week. I’ll also follow up with you between sessions, usually by text or email. If any questions come up that are outside my scope, I’ll connect you to the right resources. While this is considered research, your conversations will remain confidential, and data will be de-identified. You can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. By the end of the four weeks, we hope you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, and that you feel empowered to manage your spiritual, mental, and physical health. Thank you for participating—your input will help shape whether this program can be implemented at a larger scale.

"That's what I'm wondering about. No yeah no it's a great, it's a great question and I, I eat early enough so that by the time that I go to bed, I don't have any acting rapid insulin in my system, which, that is most likely 90% the reason why I experience hypoglycemia when I'm sleeping. Um. Another reason could be I didn't have enough of a big meal at dinner because I wasn't hungry. And my long acting insulin kicks in and continues to work because it works 24 hours, and that's the second reason why I may have a hypoglycemia. Like I cannot go too long without enough sugars in my system. So it's the balance between the two. And, you know, I've had this for five years and oh my goodness, I've played trial and error. And I still, you know once in a while have the hypo at night, and that feels very much outside of my control. Because you know like it's like first, the first strategy is have the dinner at the same time every night which I do. Another strategy is have the same meal, you know, the same combination, so I play with the same meal. It's like protein, carbs, you know, vegetables, it looks like there's, are very boring, they look all the same. I mean, you know, in terms of macros. They're exciting because I cook so, um, and then the last thing is you know check your sugars before going to bed. Two hours before going to bed and before, right before, you know, turning the lights off. And if I'm at the right level there's nothing I need to do. I sometimes have the intuition to have an extra piece of sugar before going to bed. If I know that my meal was too small. But sometimes, everything is, you know, sort of normal, and I still do that. So I think the strategy is there.","So, and in terms of going back and thinking about improving or working on sleep because I know that's what you brought up earlier, how do I develop a better like sleeping routine.

"No, honestly like I think, I think what's really helped me is like intentionally setting my goals beforehand, and not just being like oh I'll get to it when I get to it or like I'll figure it out in a little bit. Like talking about it early on kind of plants the seed in my in my head, and then subconsciously I'm planning and like do this and do that and so once I think about it early on, it allows me to like my personality I think also helps achieving my goals because it's like once something's already like once I say I'm going to do something, I have to do it because it's like if I don't then I just feel like crappy at the end like oh I didn't do that or like I didn't get to that and I messed up and, you know, especially if it's something that benefits me in the long run like my workouts and stuff like that.

And the goal of course is for you to gain sort of skills that can help you long term, right. So I think you bring up a really good point about how important it is to intentionally set goals. So in thinking about, you know, future goals that you set for yourself, or even just thinking about improving your health overall. Whenever you find yourself in that situation or kind of wanting to refresh things up. Use this again, the idea of goal setting is really helpful. And it's, it's also the reason why we focus so much on it every week because if we just break things down into smaller, more doable steps and tasks, it can really help us to reach like bigger goals that we have in mind. It makes them more attainable, in a way. Yeah, so as you continue to grow in your health journey or your wellness, just think of everything as how can I set a goal around this that can help me achieve like what I want at the end, which I know for you you had really wanted to work on strengthening and being able to be stronger and lift.

Like, that's a medical diagnosis, where ever gonna be like you know non medical terms like I would say maybe I have insomnia just because it's hard for me to go to sleep, and then it's hard for me to stay consistently asleep like I wake up multiple times in the night.

I need to make like next week for example I need to make a lasagna for an event anyway and so I was going to like make one to give and then like make myself a small one like for my own dinner on Monday.

"Yeah, that's a good question. I think so, I think it's just like healthier alternatives so like I said with this sandwich that I'm craving like if I make it at home it's probably like four or 500 or 600 calories if I go out and buy it, it's probably like eight, nine, 1000 calories. Same with several of these like the Chick-fil-A sandwich you know I'm like, I'm going to coat it with like milk, eggs and flour and then put it in the air fryer instead of like deep frying it so it's healthier. So like the cooking style is different too. Yeah, more control maybe. Definitely, yeah more control. I like cooking too I think it's like, I don't know if soothing is the right word but it's like something that I enjoy doing and I know that I enjoy doing it, even when I'm like trying to avoid doing it because I'm tired. And so I know it makes me feel like happy, or good or whatever. I'm cleaning up not so much so I'm like kind of dreading that but that's okay. Um, so yeah I think I think it has health benefits I think that those matter but I don't think that they're like the primary motivators here, especially like this week.","Yeah, I think it's good to be mindful of that and also, we'll check in next week to see like, like just a reflection of it essentially.

And so I think like with that in mind, I'm pretty confident like probably a seven, that if I felt like I was trapped in by it I think that would make it more difficult because I would say like, oh man, I'm really supposed to cook that steak tonight but I really really just want sushi, you know, whereas if I said like, oh, I can cook the steak tomorrow and just have leftovers today like that would make it a little bit more attainable and give me a little bit more control and flexibility so, yeah.",So I'll change the goal to say like in the next week you will follow your meal plan for 10 meals out of 14 meals.,goal_setting,nutrition,10.0,one thing gonna say there some days when,Edited meeting_saved_closed_caption - Jazmin Jauregui(23).txt

It's... like the soda. Like for me right now it's like super hard to just like... I'm not drinking soda like 24/7, because I'm not like I had soda with soda but it's just like I have it here in the house so if I'm like, for dinner or something I'll just serve myself like a cup instead of like drinking water or drinking something else like more healthy.

So there's definitely some points you made earlier about things you want to focus on. And you had mentioned the soda intake before. And my hope was that with increasing the water intake that would actually help you so that you drink less soda, right? Because you're now you're hydrated and you don't need to reach out for that soda as much. I mean it's something that you enjoy and I always say everything in moderation. So if you can just find a way to limit that time. I think that should be fine. It's more of not wanting to do it every day that I hear you saying, but within that you also brought up this idea of taking care of yourself a little bit more. And that can be done in multiple ways right? That can be done in making sure you're drinking more water, or decreasing the amount of soda.

So I think like I kind of struggle with that a little bit but I think in the past what has helped is actually just having like me time whether it's me sitting on the couch, like watching some TV or like taking a nap or just kind of anything that helps me not be on the computer because I'm like on the computer like 24/7. So just kind of disengaging from social media, disengaging from like the computer and doing some self care.

It took me 10 minutes to get to one side of the place and then nine or 10 minutes to come back so even just 20 minutes of outdoor time, I think that would be the perfect self care.

"Yeah, I think, I do some walks like with my dogs but of course it's not the same because I mean when I walk with my dogs, it's like, oh it's like their walk, so they go everywhere, versus if I were to go walk by myself, it's a little more relaxing, not stressing about my dogs barking because they bark at everybody and you know it's not as stressful so I think like walking can help. I think also something that like has helped me is like cooking. And, like in the past, because I feel like I just kind of like shut down and put like this wall and just start cooking and I don't listen to anybody. I just put like music on and I cook and I really enjoy cooking. So that has been something else that like has been kind of like helping.

I think it's great that you are able to identify each, but know that they're very interconnected. So my goal, as you mentioned, is to support you in your physical health.

"No, it's hard to believe. It's kind of wild. This one was a little bit harder to track - it wasn't as hard to do, but it was a little bit harder to like measure. Specifically, I'm like I feel like I drink more water than I track, but that one was harder, and I know we talked about like the one Hydro Flask but then like I drink water outside of that as well and so like for example last Friday night I went out drinking. And I know how much fun it was, that wasn't gonna say a mistake but it wasn't a mistake, it was like an undergrad college like haven't been that messy in a long time. Looking back, fun, and like I know I drank tons of water, but it was like out of glasses and out of, you know, a plastic water bottle and so I'm like I can't even quantify how much I drank. And that kind of came up a couple of times and then also I know we talked about this too like when I start my day when it's half full, I just like finish it and I refill it and then it's like whoa was that 32 ounces or was that you know 20, whatever. That one was just a little bit harder to measure but I thought it was a good practice so I might keep that goal. And then the steps one was easy to measure because my phone does it for me. But it was a little bit harder to do so like yesterday I didn't have enough steps basically and had to run an errand in the evening and was like oh I'll just walk instead of driving and like got the steps in that way but that one I had to be more mindful. So I honestly might keep that one too. Um, let's see, I think what was the day that we met last week, I believe it was Thursday. So I hit it, I got 4000 steps Thursday, Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. It was four days right - it was four, I forget what we said it was for yeah yeah I hit it it was just like I had to be a little more intentional about hitting that one, as opposed to just happening naturally.

So that one's a little bit lower, but still, still overall accomplished.","Yeah, I think I'm like looking at the barriers right - you identified the measuring or the tracking one. The water goal was a challenge so it makes sense why it was hard to, it's hard to gauge like how successful you were or if you achieved it. I wonder, like, I'm not a big fan of like using plastic water bottles but like if we had said like plastic water bottles that are like already filled for you, you can start a fresh one, it would have been easier, maybe easier to see the progress. Or maybe saying that, like, a number of glasses or like sip of water 20 times a day, I don't know, like, neither of those would have been easy to quantify either but I think it would have been a little bit less restrictive than like it has to be this 32 ounce Hydro Flask, you know.

"That's a good question. Um, I think just checking in, like, even at like different times throughout the day like, how's the water thing going? Hey like do you refill your water bottle yet today, you know, I think a lot of it is just like forgetfulness and I'll leave the house - this happened like twice this week I left the house and I forgot to bring it with me. And as soon as I got in the car I was like I want water and I don't have any water. So one of the times was right before my tattoo appointment and I knew I would need water and so I called my sister who I was picking up and I was like, yo, bring me some water. And the other time it was just out running errands and I just like didn't have any for a couple of hours. Um, so I think like, just a reminder helps, I'm not - when it's there when I'm thinking about it or I might even add like a reminder to my phone maybe like a 9pm like track water or drink water, because it's just, it's not that I don't want to do it, I just like forget.","So, there's a couple of ways that I can, or, I guess, is it better to do like a text message to check in, or like, send you like a Google invite, and say like, hey track your water, and then I can send it out at a specific time every day at a specific time?",greeting,hydration,1,good question checking even different times throughout day,Edited meeting_saved_closed_caption - Jazmin Jauregui(22).txt

So I set myself a reminder on my phone for like 9pm every day to just like drink and track water, because that's kind of about the time when I'm like, maybe I'm tracking my meals or maybe I'm like lying in bed watching TV and it's just like the little reminder that I feel like would be helpful. And then yeah, you just texting like however often like and just at random times like that would be like drink your water. Exactly like, I know you haven't had any water yet today. If you haven't peed five times you're not hydrated. Drink more water.","So, let's. I think that's a good. I can definitely do that.

Whichever.,"Okay, let's go with the steps, because I feel like that one was a little more solid goal. So you will figure out how we phrased it last time, walk. Yeah, 4000 steps a day four days a week I think tracking it like using my phone. Okay, so, I'm curious.

And I think most days I already hit 4200 so like the four days this last week were 7900, 4074, 4260 and 5665 so it's already like most of them are over that threshold so maybe we say like 4500.

But anyway, I'm like I know the days when I like get, you know, triple digit steps like that I feel awful. I'm inside all day and I think it's just like feeling better feeling more energized, feeling more productive throughout the work day like those are the days when I end up like working at my desk and I'm kind of doing the other things that I want to do. So like yesterday for example I worked all day and then I had class and then I needed to hit these steps. So I walked to go pick something up from the neighbors. And then I went to the grocery store after and like normally on a Wednesday like I wouldn't get that many things done because I would just like veg out all day and I get like 700 steps. But knowing like not only that I had to hit this goal but that I like would be more productive and would feel more energized if I did kind of motivated me - after class I laid in bed for like 15 minutes and then I was like, okay, time to go like, I feel like there are a lot of factors.

And then like the weekend is flexible so I could definitely fit in like the farmers market or running errands or whatever, I'm good. I love the farmers market. So I think I'm confident I think, I think that the slightly increased threshold, I remember why I got so many last Thursday. My sister was here - two sisters were here, and one had to take a zoom call so the other one and I had to be out of the apartment for like an hour and a half. We walked to pick up dinner in downtown Mountain View, it's like a mile away. So it ended up being like an hour and a half long walk. And we got dinner at the end of it and I had blisters from my Birkenstocks from walking that far but it was good. It was nice and then like to get dinner at the end of it, too, was cool so I think like having those sorts of opportunities and knowing like even tonight I need to run like just down the block - it's not even 4000 steps but like to pick something up from a different neighbor. So I think it's attainable. I think like an eight, and I think that like saying 4500 instead of 4000 is like just challenging enough that I'll actually have to plan it and execute it rather than just kind of having it happen without too much intention behind it.","Cool.

Um, so yeah, I planned it out as lunch and dinner and I left like some space for breakfast to be kind of whatever it wants to be. I went to the grocery store last night and I did buy a couple of breakfast things that I'm like looking forward to having. This breakfast place near my grandparents house had these really awesome breakfast sandwiches that had like sriracha mayo and grilled onions on them. And I was like I can make that so I bought like sriracha mayo and hamburger buns. So like that's one of the things that like all I have to do when I'm craving it basically. So I planned out lunch and dinner and I left some spots for like leftovers and then I left like Saturday I know I'll be out with a friend so like planned on going out that evening, and then Tuesday for my sister's birthday planned on going out that evening. So I plotted in some like flexibility with eating out or eating leftovers or kind of eating whatever. I already kind of botched what I was going to have for lunch today, um, but like, that's okay the dinner plan today matters more for me. I also like need to cook some chicken that's about to go bad in my fridge.

Um, yeah. Money is a factor in some of it's like money I already spent so like I already spent all this money on like the Hello Fresh kit and groceries and so to throw it out would be a waste of that money but also to order delivery out of my own pocket for the next week would be a waste of my money. Yeah. And just to kind of make better use of my time I think like right now I told myself like oh I don't have time to cook and after work I'm like I just want to crawl into bed and watch TV but if I'm looking at it I'm like oh I'm just going to take 20 minutes to prep this and pop it in the oven or whatever. I need to make like next week for example I need to make a lasagna for an event anyway and so I was going to like make one to give and then like make myself a small one like for my own dinner on Monday.

Same with several of these like the Chick-fil-A sandwich you know I'm like, I'm going to coat it with like milk, eggs and flour and then put it in the air fryer instead of like deep frying it so it's healthier. So like the cooking style is different too. Yeah, more control maybe. Definitely, yeah more control. I like cooking too I think it's like, I don't know if soothing is the right word but it's like something that I enjoy doing and I know that I enjoy doing it, even when I'm like trying to avoid doing it because I'm tired.

One is that we can phrase the health goal to say at least two times in the next week. That way it for sure gets met, and then anything above that would be a plus. The other thing that I'm thinking about is if you do Friday and Saturday, you can say, I will be physically active for at least 45 minutes so bumping up the time that you're going to be physically active.

But at the end of the intervention, like, after we're done meeting, you will be interviewed by like the principal investigator.

I still want us to think about what do you want to check in about today or what do you want to focus on. And think about your goals a little bit more long term, like for example in three to six months, what do you want to be able to accomplish.

But if you remember that it will affect the way you feel, the way your body responds to things, and our mood is definitely affected a lot. So hopefully getting outdoors and doing some of the activities that you are doing have helped you be able to understand how that can also change the way that you feel and that in itself can motivate you to stay consistent and wanting to keep it up for a little longer. So are there specific goals that you want to continue to be able to do? Do you want to continue working on the previous goals that you had like the eating practice and the physical activity?

I do want to like increase the frequency and how often I do both, but I'm just yeah I really just focusing on those. And I think for me it's about building up my energy in the long term. I feel like I have very low energy throughout the day. So, and I have a new clinical training site with children on the spectrum. So that's going to require a lot of energy and I want to be able to give my all in that training site. So I definitely like long term wise I want to increase my energy level in order to, you know, really utilize my day.","And I would say that the goals that you set for yourself can help you achieve that. Do you feel you've seen that happen? So hopefully keeping up with those will be helpful. In terms of something, what I'll do is I'll write the goals that you had last week, and that you'll continue with those for this week.

Like a nine.,"I always say anything above seven tells me that okay you've thought about it and yes this is something that you will consistently work on. If it's anything lower, then we need to do some problem solving. And thinking about the progress that you've made over the last three, four weeks. What would you say have been like your successes, or what have been some of the successes that you've had?",goal_setting,stress_management,9,nine,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS4 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt
"I think a major success is eating breakfast. Well really eating every meal of the day now. That hasn't, that's been an issue for me, either forgetting or just not being motivated to go find something to eat. So I've definitely been proud of myself for eating more consistently. I've had way less stomach problems. And I think that's a good thing. And then, I think exercising too. I think my shoulders, I can already see a difference because that's kind of an area I've been focusing on because I have really bad shoulders. So I already see like a difference when I see my reflection, like if I have a T shirt on they're a lot more square and look not as like narrow. So I'm just noticing the changes has definitely been a good thing.","And what are some of the, you mentioned this a little bit earlier with the energy level, but what are some of the challenges that you're still facing that maybe we could do some problem solving, so that when they come up, you're able to know okay this is what I can do to overcome this.",barrier_identification,nutrition,10,major success eating breakfast eating every meal day,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS4 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt
"I think myself is probably the biggest obstacle. Like I'm very willing to say, Oh, I don't want to do something so I'm not going to do it. And I need to really break that mentality and tell myself like this is a requirement, this is a required assignment, you can't skip it. Because I do, like there'll be times where I'm just like yeah I really just don't feel like it, so I'm not going to. And then my partner will be like, no, get out there and go do at least 10 minutes and I'm like, all right, and then that will extend to the full time so I'm like okay I'm already out here. So it's really just that initial step of just doing it.","I would say that tends to be quite a challenge at times right, taking that first step. You've been able to find ways to do it. And it also sounds like you have support from others that can push you to do it. So it's very helpful to have support. And I think that is something that's something that can push us forward at times when we doubt ourselves or it might not even be doubt, when we prefer to just say okay, I'm not going to do this right now, but if someone gives us that motivation or that little extra push, then we might be more likely to do it.

And I'm like, so I know like I have to, if I tell him only once he's going to be like, Wow, really, and I'm like, No. So it's just I think having somebody else hold me accountable is helpful, because I do make the excuse of like, well, I'm young, I'm healthy enough, you know I'm able to walk as far as I need to walk, I'm able to get up and go wherever I need to go, so I do make the excuse that I am capable of doing anything. I don't necessarily feel like I need to exercise but I am reminded you know, in the long term, I'm not going to always be able to do this and it's really about the future, not necessarily about right now.","Yes, I would say, I mean especially when we're thinking about in the realm of public health we think a lot about prevention and preventing future potential chronic conditions, or just the ability to be able to do more as we get older is really important and critical. And just as you mentioned when we are at a certain age we think well we can do it all right now. And just like you mentioned, it may not always be the case right? Because eventually, if we are very lucky, we will get to an older age, and things are going to change, our body will change.

If I can't necessarily just reach. Anyway, and it's kind of like okay well that's like the first thing to go right now is my shoulder and everything else will start to follow.

Shoulders are my weakness too. I'm going to tell you a funny story as a side note, and I have like rotator cuff issues. And, yeah, and I get what is called a frozen shoulder, every so often, which to me is I have to walk around like this because it's so painful. And I can't move it, or I call it the T-rex shoulder.

It's just these messages are always like speaking to things that I'm always like, Yes, you're right. I know I need to do that.","And our hope is that as you're thinking about it then when we do our goal setting. Then you can set goals around it so for example right now you're doing breakfast, maybe just adding fruit or a vegetable to your breakfast. And that's those are ways that we could add that on to what you're already doing. We covered everything. Let me give you just a few more details about what comes next. Because today's session four. And as I mentioned you have set great goals for yourself for this last week, I'll send you an email with a summary of what those will be. And then for next steps, you are going to continue getting a few more text messages. I believe your messages will end maybe this Sunday or so. After that, so please continue to respond to them if you have any thoughts on them. You will, by the end of today you will receive a link to do a follow up survey. I think you should be able to get that today. The survey is similar to the one that you did at the very beginning of the program. However, it should be a little bit shorter and it should not take more than 15 minutes. After you complete the survey, you're going to be invited to meet with one of my EXAMEN colleagues, because they want to do like a follow up meeting to get your feedback, to hear more about your experience during the program to get your feedback on how to improve the program. This meeting is typically a little bit longer, maybe 40 to 60 minutes. As of now, we've been trying to schedule them around the same time when you and I meet. But I think I was asked because interviewers have a bit of a conflict with this time I think they wanted to know if you could meet on the 20th at this time at 10am.

Okay, so let's keep the same time. Right. At 10am, okay. But 10 works. Yeah. Okay, so that I would also give you a little bit more time to complete the survey, because ideally you want to complete the survey, the follow up survey before your meeting. I'm going to put on the survey email a deadline for it, it won't be before the 20th. But just as soon as you get it then, the sooner the better because then you don't have to think about it. So I'll send, so you will get the calendar invite until you complete the survey so that's something to keep in mind. So you'll get the survey, complete that and then we'll add you to the calendar invite but I'll put a hold for that date and time for now on our calendar and invite the person that can do the interview. Any questions about that? Well thank you so much for participating in EXAMEN. It's been a pleasure working with you these last four weeks. You worked really hard to make lots of positive changes with your physical activity and eating breakfast every morning. So remember that you are in control of certain things in your life, right. And it's important to just stay active and moving to improve our health and just overall wellness as we move forward. I know it's also the end of the semester so having some time for yourself and hopefully these practices can help you stay like centered and clear when you have other stressors that are going on.

Like I really like the variety in my diet, like adding more things in, you know, coming up with different ways to put more fruits and vegetables into my diet. And then the harder ones is, you know, cutting down on the takeout. But I've already like started to try and work on that. So like Tuesdays and I'm not going to have the problem anymore because I'm not in class, but like Tuesdays and Thursdays when I would have later classes, I would on Tuesdays I would make lasagna earlier in the day and then it can just be put in the oven. And I even added, and this is it's actually pretty good if you want to try it, I mixed in spinach with the meat. So added vegetables to the meal and I didn't have to worry about making a side or anything too. So it's just put a lot of spinach in with the meat and then everything else was like normal. And that worked out really well. And then just finding different like slow cooker meals for days when I know I'm going to be busy was nice. Like I did Campbell's Soup because I was like these sauce, like I know packages if you want to call it that. They're like they're easy slow cooker meals and the sauce comes in like this little pouch and you just add the meat. So you just put the meat in your slow cooker and the meat and vegetables if it calls for vegetables, and then you just put this sauce in and that's it. Or they have one pan meals which I did a couple times. Like they have like Thai chicken curry, which I'm not that confident in my own cooking skills, so to be able to just have that packet and put in and then just add the rice. And then I was like well how do I add vegetables? This was not just meat and rice. So you know, I put peas in with the with the rice and stuff so that it was a little bit more variety.

Well, it didn't do either of those things. None of those things. It didn't get bigger, didn't get harder, it still hurt so it wasn't going away.

And he kind of narrowed it down to like it's mild fascial kind of imbalance. Like my adductors were way, way, way too tight and so it was pulling my kneecap out of the alignment that it needed to be in. And so I went to physical therapy to work on my adductor strength, and that was kind of how also kind of jump started a lot of my fitness was working on my adductor stuff, and then also strengthening my hips because he said that would really help as well. And so like good adductor stretches since those tend to get tight on me, I guess, so I can maintain that would be fantastic. Also hip stretches.","Yeah, the hips are important, especially and I know you're very young, but as women and as we get older, I think hips are like super important to maintain just for walking purposes. I don't know if you've ever seen this, but have you ever seen like older folks that when they walk they don't like step anymore, they kind of shuffle? And that has to do with like our flexibility in our joints and our hips. So just thinking about that really early on, it's really important.

And so in thinking about what you shared today, that you want to maintain that consistency. I think being able to continue with what you had before and gradually adding more like today we are talking about stretching, and weekly as you see how your goals are going, you can think about is there something new that I want to implement or do I just want to continue with what I have and maybe enhance it a little bit, or add a little bit more to that. I would say definitely think about the skills or the tools that have helped you moving forward. That way you can continue to use that as you go on. So for example, though, the weekly goal setting, if that's something that you find is actually helpful, then I definitely encourage you to set aside some time each week to set up some goals that you want to work on, especially related to health.

Hi. Sorry I'm running late today. I'm good. I clicked the Google Meet link instead and figured nope that's the zoom link.,"I know there's so many different ways to meet these days that, you know, it could be confusing and you're thinking it's one thing or don't know which platform. So I'm glad you checked sooner than later. So thank you so much for joining me today. My name is Erica, and I'm going to be your health coach for the next four weeks. Before we get started I want to provide you with a quick, just a quick introduction about what the program entails, which I think you have a pretty good idea by now. And then we'll get into our goal setting and setting goals around health and wellness. How does that sound?",goal_setting,nutrition,7,sorry running late today good clicked google meet,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS1 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt
Sounds good.,"So as you might have noticed, EXAMEN is a two part intervention. One part of it is the daily text messages that you have been receiving. And the other part is meeting with me, the health coach. So in my role I will be meeting with you once a week through zoom. And the goal is to meet for at least 20 minutes. If we need a little bit more time than that we can talk about it and work that out. But during that time it's really to focus on checking in with you about your thoughts about the daily messages that you're receiving, but also set goals around health and wellness that you want to work on. I will also be asking you about your stress level, and how your stress is from week to week. So in addition to that, I will follow up with you through a text during the week to see how your goal is coming along and how it's progressing during the week. If at any time there's any questions that I feel might be sort of outside my scope of work or topics that I'm not too sure about, I'll do my best to refer you to someone that can help. That way you get appropriate resources for that. So as you are aware this is a research study. We are collecting quite a bit of information. Our specific conversations will remain confidential and any information is de-identified. So the conversations are not linked to the person. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing. And by the end of the four weeks we do hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, which we'll talk about today, and any other skills that we discuss that you feel empowered to be able to manage your physical, your mental, and your spiritual health. That's really our goal with EXAMEN. So thank you so much for participating and this is really going to help us to figure out if we can actually produce this on a bigger scale for all USF students, so I'm excited for that.

"I think for me, so I'm a clinical psych student so I might throw a lot of psychology terms out there without realizing it, but I'm in like the precontemplation phase of wanting to get healthier, wanting to be better with exercise, eating healthier, all of that jazz. But, and I actually started to do that right before COVID hit. I started going to the gym for two weeks straight and I was like, Yes! And COVID happened and all the gyms shut down and I was like, Well, so I went back to kind of my pattern of just not working out, not eating healthy, just kind of doing whatever I need to do to get through my psychology program without really caring about my health.","Yeah. And I mean I think right now, it's a bit of a stressful time and stress tends to sort of prevent us from doing a lot of the things that we want to do.

Maybe we have to do exercise in a different way, if it's not being able to go to the gym. Although I think some of them are open these days, but even then, let's say I don't feel comfortable going, right?

And, you know, not only do the people in your life know it, but people who don't even know you know that you need this. So that's kind of what stood out to me. And then the exercise piece, I mean, I think I get outside at least 30 minutes a day because I do have a dog that I walk, but I don't feel like it's enough because I was an athlete up until college, and once college happened, it was like sports were non existent, exercising was non existent. I just became so immersed in school that all the physical stuff went away.

"Oh, I mean in general the stress and anxiety that I'm feeling is super high being in my program. I've decreased it, thank goodness, by taking on an extra year. I made that decision this semester, so everyone in my cohort is preparing to propose their dissertation next month. And if that was me I would be really, hair falling out, like it just wouldn't happen. So I gave myself an extra year which has definitely decreased the stress. But I'm in my early phases of preparing my dissertation and that's really anxiety provoking for me because I've never done anything like that. So that's just, I feel like for me it's just the anxiety, it does create a lot of procrastination in my life. And ever since COVID started, I've been in this room, ever since, and I haven't been anywhere else. And so I feel like that has created, I mean I know I've had depression on and off, non-diagnosed, but it's definitely increased that just being in the same space all day. It kind of makes it hard to be motivated to do things. So I think I've definitely reverted into a personality that I haven't experienced before. I'm usually really on top of things, I complete all assignments on time and thoroughly, and lately I have, I forgot to do a presentation, I forgot to turn in a homework assignment and I was just like, this is not me. I've never done these things. So I'm just trying to pull myself back to where I was before COVID started, my productive, highly motivated self that was really driven to get through this program. I think right now I'm definitely experiencing burnout for my clients. So that's kind of like a multi layered thing. So I just kind of wanted to throw that out there. I am a big ball of stress and anxiety, followed by some sprinkled depression. But I think, and that's the main thing that keeps me from really helping myself. So I'm really trying to make sure that I'm not in the way of what I want to achieve. So that's really why I did sign up for this because I was like, I felt like it was for me. I was like oh my gosh like these are exactly the things I'm dealing with. I'm struggling and I don't know who to ask help from. I don't seek out therapy because I'm like the process of finding a therapist is already stressful in and of itself. So for me to want to become a therapist but have trouble finding a therapist is ironic. For me it's like I don't get it. So I just I'm just throwing all that at you. Just so you're aware, but I think this is really going to help.","That's our hope too. And this program was very, it wasn't intended to be done during a period of COVID. It was intended to actually be done last fall, before it all started. Well I guess it was already going on but the intention was it was actually supposed to be in person. And we had to change everything to be an online format. But I think it's actually worked out really well because we've gotten to reach a lot more students this way. And at the same time we are kind of helping each other as we go through this period of time that's very uncertain. It's changed a lot of the ways that we do things. Like you said, we're not used to being indoors so much. I am a bit of an introvert so I'm always indoors, but I mean I do like to go to certain places, but not being able to maybe see friends as much or just travel or all the things that we take for granted at times. I think it's really made us sort of readjust and reframe the way that we see the world, but that can also affect our just internal mood, our anxiety, as you mentioned, any feelings of depression that we might have had in the past, can actually get a little extra and flare up during this time.",goal_setting,nutrition,1,mean general stress anxiety feeling super high being,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS1 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt
Same time every week.,"Okay. Yeah, I mean that works perfectly because then we can just set it up and if anything does come up just let me know. And we can figure out how to work it out. Okay, so I'll send you an updated calendar invite, it'll have a link. So just remember it's Thursdays. And I can also text you right before if you want a little reminder, or I'll just assume that you remember. Okay. And then, any other thoughts? And then I'll send you an email reminder with what we discussed today. And mainly the goal, nothing else like anything private that we discussed. I don't want you to get like this huge email alert. Those are scary. Any questions that you have for me today? Well, perfect. Well, it was very good to meet you, Brittany. Best of luck, you will get there. Do you have ideas for your dissertation yet?

"I'm actually going to, like blanking but there's a prison program called Positive Change, and they, you know my dog's walking in, they take rescue animals so shelter dogs and they place them with inmates in California and the inmates train those dogs so that they can be adopted. So my dissertation is on understanding the rehabilitative process and the benefits of that program.","Oh, yeah, it is amazing.

"I love dogs so the fact that I can get that into my dissertation was exciting, and I made contact with the program and they're excited to work with me so I was like, holy crap, I care about this.","Yeah, and I think in terms of when we think of people that are incarcerated, there's some programming. But there's really not a lot of conversations about it, right? What is really happening in our jail system.",establishing_agenda,time_management,7,love dogs fact can into dissertation exciting made,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS1 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt
