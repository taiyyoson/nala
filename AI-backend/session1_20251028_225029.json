Between our weekly sessions, you'll have the chance to put what we discuss into action and see what feels right for you. I'll be here to support you, ask questions that help you reflect, and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\nDoes that sound good to you? Do you have any questions about how we'll work together?"

Right now when you said you want to look at yourself in the mirror without flinching and mentioned weighing 30 pounds less, that gives me a sense of direction. But to make this actionable, we need to get more specific about what you'll actually do and when.\n\nWhat's one concrete action related to your health or wellness that you could realistically see yourself doing regularly, even with your college and work schedule?"

Building on something you already do consistently is often easier than starting something brand new.\n\nWhen you say walk longer, what does that look like for you? How much longer are you thinking, and how many days a week do you realistically see yourself doing this given your college and work commitments?"

Since you're juggling college and work, have you thought about when during the week these walks might fit best into your schedule?"
