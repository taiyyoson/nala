12:02:30 Hi. Hi. How's it going, going good. Thank you.
12:02:35 How are you, good I just can't believe that it's already one thing.
12:02:44 I feel like I talked to you like yesterday.
12:02:48 I know time is just going by really quick. I think that's all it is. Yeah, but I'm, I'm glad that we're able to make it today.
12:03:00 Trying to okay with everything that I need on my screen.
12:03:07 So how are you how are you doing today.
12:03:08 I'm good. I'm just like this. I feel like this whole week and then the following weeks are going to be so busy because I'm kind of in the finals time in my program so there's just like a lot of papers and stuff and then work.
12:03:27 So, yeah.
12:03:29 So there's a lot of things that are coming up, or for you at this time.
12:03:34 And how was your action plan for or your goal for last week, how did it go.
12:03:42 I think about really well.
12:03:55 of, because on Sunday. I have a lot of homework so one of my friends. She's also a student us stuff but she's going to the last law school there.
12:04:05 And so, I live like outer sunset.
12:04:10 So there's this like cafe, it's called Java. Java beach. And she's like, Oh, do you want to go like super early in the morning and just like do homework and stuff and I was like, like I had to think about whether that would be considered like a social
12:04:26 for myself, or like a very like wholesome productive, like day, and I was like yeah but if it's only like us to because then if you invite like more people than it beats the purpose and yeah so it was just us to and we were there from like 10am to like
12:04:49 like 4pm, so we, and I got a lot of work done so I was like wow I was like, I feel like, without even planning it I planned like a social part of my life like I was still able to get out of my house and talk to my friend but then also like I made like
12:04:58 we both had like a game plan like we're going to get stuff done so I'm pretty cool.
12:05:06 Yeah, I mean I think that's a great modification for what you wanted, which was to focus on score, but also find some time to just spend time for for yourself doing productive activity so that's that's very good.
12:05:18 Yeah, I know you had also wanted to start some strength training, strength
12:05:26 training, how did that go.
12:05:29 It went really well actually have.
12:05:33 So you know I told you I had the cut and assessment with my personal with a personal trainer.
12:05:37 So he was very convincing and actually ended up signing up for a few classes with hit all sessions with him.
12:05:46 And I'm just like really excited because even that first session. So my first like real session was on Friday, like last Friday. And then my like first, like, one on one like for real like starting everything with like my goals that I want with on Monday
12:06:04 and that was like really like a confidence booster like, I guess I'm not as weak as I thought I was like he started me off like very low and then when I was able to do it like nothing he was like yeah you're not what you told me you were and so he kind
12:06:17 of just like added more weight to like what I was already trying to lift and it was really like it boosted my confidence and I was like wow like maybe I do like said, I set the bar very low for myself.
12:06:29 Um, and so I'm really excited because I told him that like I just want to get more stronger and like, be confident in like the weights and stuff and yeah i mean that's what we're going to be doing so actually have like another session today so I'm really
12:06:43 excited.
12:07:01 It is so great to hear so right now how many sessions are you going to be doing a week with him.
12:06:53 Um, so he said that because I'm new this first the first three weeks or two times a week, so I can get into the group so like my muscles can like, I don't know he really explained it was like Okay, that makes sense.
12:07:05 And then after that can be once a week.
12:07:08 But that's just my one on one sessions with him like he wants me to commit to like being there, like four or five times a week, which I was a galley that's pretty doable like I do that kind of either way.
12:07:20 And in a way, and also like they gave me a book.
12:07:25 And so he's writing down like where I'm starting and then I'm going to see my progress as I'm going and like, Yeah, I was just like, wow, like that's, that's really cool and I never thought I would do it and I am and so I'm just like, and it's like weird
12:07:39 because I'm working out in front of everyone like kind of like my biggest fear, but I feel better because he's there and like, I'm not making a fool out of myself like it's like I'm.
12:07:54 If I am doing it wrong and because he's going to teach you how to do it right like that makes sense like my son is just like a little bit more better now in the gym.
12:08:02 I think you've taken some great steps to move forward, which was, you know, definitely having that console and now brought up a whole new way of thinking about strength training, and having that support system can be very helpful.
12:08:17 And like you said it's building your self confidence already about being able to do this and you're actually at a different level than you expect it to be so that's, that's amazing.
12:08:27 So if you could give them a rating to on a scale of one to 10 of how you're doing and meeting your goals, what would you give it so far. On a scale of one to 10.
12:08:40 Um, I would say like I'm just like a solid like nine.
12:08:45 Okay, now that's very good. Yeah.
12:08:50 That's perfect.
12:08:51 And earlier you mentioned a little bit about how there's a lot of things that are going to be coming up. So, for this week on a scale of one to 10, what was your stress level this week, my stress levels probably like at an eight because yeah like all
12:09:10 my deadlines, just, I was like oh, that deadlines literally two weeks, like, you know, it's so it's like a lot, but yeah so I'm pretty stressed, I'm now manage.
12:09:26 So a lot of things have happened since we met, you had your training session you've been able to start on that strength training, you were able to set aside some time for yourself.
12:09:37 what are you hoping to check in about today.
12:09:42 I think just like in general.
12:09:49 My health and well actually I'm going home this weekend.
12:09:54 And to visit my family, because I haven't seen it so I got a new job. In February, and before my new job in February, I was working. Literally every single day.
12:10:09 So I was working like six, seven days a week, like I had no days off because my job before was very demanding like they want to meet weekends and they wanted me weekdays and even when I had school like all my school days I would work on my second part
12:10:25 job and so I was working so much and in January I literally had like the biggest like meltdown like I was just so unhappy with this job like it was not serving me and my current like I had nothing to do with my career like it's very corporate and like
12:10:40 I hated it.
12:10:42 hated it. Um, but the money was good, and I think because I am afraid of financial insecurity I put that first you know like I was like, No, like I need to work and I need to work and they paid me very well but like I said I hated it like I was so unhappy
12:10:57 and like it was horrible, but I think I was trying to not think about how much I hated it and just look at like I'm getting paid really well like, I don't worry about anything.
12:11:06 And then I also like because my parents like struggle, like that was my way of also just like helping them pay certain things.
12:11:15 But then I realized that it wasn't happy and then my friends like she introduced me to like a new network opportunity and I applied. I didn't think I was going to get it but I got it and then they pay me exactly the same with like way more flexibility
12:11:33 like I work from home whenever I want or if I want to show up to the office that can i weekends off like it's beautiful like I had never thought I'd be in this position, and because of that like I promised myself that I would visit my family more, because
12:11:48 it's been like for the past like four years I've always been like a workaholic, kind of, and it's not that it's like forced upon me like I just, I do like working a lot, but it's also I think it stems from like being like, I don't want to be like financially
12:12:04 like on a limb you know and then, and I know it's because if, especially with covert I think that made it worse like I was like no like I'm so lucky to have a job and like I need to work as much as I can because you never know when the next Kobe is going
12:12:20 to happen and I was just I was just so scared. And so yeah, and so I'm I don't know how that ended up being conversation but, no, I was asking about what you want to check in about today and you mentioned that you're going home this weekend.
12:12:31 Yeah. And so, because of my new job I promised myself that I would prioritize things that are important to me that I kind of put on the back burner for a long time and I'm so happy that my parents are like so supportive like even when I, I missed out
12:12:45 on birthdays and holidays and stuff, and like my family's like Mexican so like we celebrate everything and they throw parties for everything and I missed out on so much in the past years.
12:12:58 And so I promised myself like okay like, even though have school and work like I need to.
12:13:03 Now that I have more flexible job I could try to go home like one weekend a month. And so this month I know that I don't want to go home but like I always have a lot of school work, but I know that if I don't go this weekend like what if I don't know
12:13:19 like I have this like paranoia of like, I don't know what something happens and I could have been like I could spend that week with my family and like, I don't know so yeah I'm going home this weekend and I'm just gonna like carve out a time for me to
12:13:32 like, work at home, there and do homework but yeah I'm just really excited to see my family and my mom and my grandma, just came back from Mexico, and stuff like that so I'm just like, I'm excited for the weekend cuz I get to spend it with my family but
12:13:47 I'm also like thinking about school like my head like schools like Eddie you get maybe as much of it done before you go. Yeah, you get some work done while you're there, as well.
12:14:03 Okay. So in thinking about the progress you've made this week with strength training, and with like carving out time for yourself. What do you think would be a good goal to set for this upcoming week.
12:14:18 And maybe it can be part of going to see your family maybe it can be something else, what do you think would actually would be most helpful for you this week.
12:14:29 I think
12:14:33 even though I'm going home this weekend, I think, still, even on and I have school, still making like a time that I'm home because I'm going Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
12:14:44 So picking like one of those days where I do something that's like active was my family, like, like we have a dog, and my parents, like, like love him, so maybe doing like a walk with with my dog and my parents are like my little sister's getting into
12:15:03 yoga.
12:15:06 Maybe like doing yoga with her and so it's like I still hang out with my family but like my goals like on track. Okay, physical activity and how many minutes do you think would be feasible to do either of the walk or the yoga.
12:15:25 Probably like 30 minutes.
12:15:38 Yeah, I don't think, I don't think it'd be less than that but I also think it'd be more than like an hour so yeah and it would mainly be either friday saturday or sunday right. Do you want it to just be one day.
12:15:41 Yeah, I think it's realistic to say one day.
12:15:46 Yeah.
12:15:49 No, that's good.
12:15:52 Here is about to die.
12:15:57 I was just thinking. So we're thinking of walking or doing yoga every 30 minutes, one day between Friday Saturday Sunday.
12:16:08 to.
12:16:09 Okay.
12:16:10 And this will be done with with family.
12:16:16 And why would you say this, or how can we measure the progress for this.
12:16:25 Probably.
12:16:28 I have an Apple Watch.
12:16:31 So maybe like.
12:16:35 I'm just being like my activity for that for that day like how it like stays consistent.
12:16:42 And how about why is this important to you, to still find time to do something active while you're going to see your family.
12:16:53 It's important to me because.
12:17:02 All right, like when someone calls me I don't know why my computer also like readings.
12:17:12 Do you have an apple, you have. Apple devices so they can sync.
12:17:15 You can turn it off.
12:17:17 But if you sync them. When your phone rings your watch will ring and then your computer also right. Oh well, yeah.
12:17:30 I was, I was saying. It's really important to me because I'm like, I'm in therapy, but I started therapy because I before coven any during coven my anxiety was like.
12:17:43 So so so bad like I would get many panic attacks like once a week.
12:17:49 And we kind of noticed that it's when I'm not doing something like active, like, because I'm a runner, when it was a coven For example, I didn't go outside I didn't have like anything in my house so it's like my activity was just so low.
12:18:06 And like all these things and I think that's one of the reasons why am I invited Can I like went through the roof.
12:18:13 And then even now I noticed like if I don't, not work out but if I go don't go out and do something that makes me feel tired at the end of the night like I'll stay up all night like tossing and turning you can get about like all these things and that
12:18:43 leaves me tunes it and then it's like a cycle. And so, I noticed that I need to have something like active to get me tired at the end of the night, because it's not like my anxiety will just like policeman.
12:18:40 Yeah, so, yeah, so it's like, in a way, like yes I like being active and all these things but at the same time it's kind of like I need to be active because if not, I'm afraid that like at night, or even during the day like I'll feel super late, like
12:19:01 Anstey or. Yeah, so, and I think that's it's a good way to put it in terms of, you have realized that yes, these things are important for your health and wellness.
12:19:09 But you've also found that it helps you like to manage, for example, anxiety, and now they're healthy ways to do it right so we, that's what we want to focus on on order the healthy habits or we can develop that can help us manage them.
12:19:33 or any other symptoms or conditions that we might experience. And so we have that you will plan and diversity with your family, either walking or yoga for 30 minutes.
12:19:43 One day during the weekend, you will use your Apple Watch, to track activity, and how confident, do you feel about being able to achieve your goal.
12:19:56 I think I'll be a pretty good. Like I think it's like a nine.
12:20:00 Okay.
12:20:02 Is there something else that you want to work on for this week or do you want to stick to, to one thing because I know you mentioned you have quite a few things coming up this week.
12:20:10 Yeah, I don't want you to feel overwhelmed with more than one thing this week. Yeah, I think, I'm focusing on that it's like my goal because even, even with this goal I still have like my separate goal with my, my trainer which is like still showing up
12:20:25 you know to the gym, so it's like, yeah, I'm sense that something that will be ongoing Do you want to continue including it just on our tracking.
12:20:43 Yeah, yeah. So right now I think you mentioned the activity with the trainer it's specifically strength training.
12:20:53 And how many days this upcoming week did you say to. Yeah, so we met up on Monday and then. Today is our second day.
12:21:02 And how long are you guys meeting for.
12:21:07 We have our sessions for 30 minutes.
12:21:11 Are you also using your Apple Watch to track that activity or using a different method to track that I use, yeah use an Apple Watch.
12:21:24 Thank you think this is great because then you also have someone that is with you and as you mentioned earlier, they can help you fix, if something is needs to be fixed or modifications that might need to be me.
12:21:37 So we also have strength training, today's between Monday and Thursday, this is happening right. Yeah.
12:21:51 30 minutes.
12:22:01 cm What is your confidence about being able to do the strength training twice a week.
12:22:01 I feel pretty confident I think
12:22:00 it's like, it's so funny to say, because I'm paying for it.
12:22:06 I'm like I have to show up I can't cancel because if I cancel like are you paid for it you know what I mean so I feel like a solid 10 that I will be able to make it.
12:22:17 I can totally relate to that.
12:22:22 Yeah, when I'm paying for something I'm more likely.
12:22:27 That's why, in a way, it's like, I felt like this is something I needed because I've done like, like I mentioned, like my friends with personal trainers and stuff like that were like free classes I used to go to but it's not as motivated as like okay
12:22:41 this is actually coming out of my pocket and like, yeah, you find that that is so interesting for our psyche in terms of, I need to be, I need to be giving someone might paycheck to motivate me to do it.
12:22:57 Yeah, so why, why do you think that happen.
12:23:06 No, I think it's. Yeah. No, I totally understand you, I do the same thing.
12:23:11 I need to be paying for something on a regular basis to remind me that I think it has to do just with the the monetary attachment to it, and how it's an investment right so now we want to make sure that we're not losing on that investment that we're making
12:23:31 so interesting.
12:23:35 So I also wanted to ask you about your successes this weekend I think you mentioned a few of them earlier.
12:23:42 I, some of the things I heard were.
12:23:49 I didn't realize that I could actually do more in terms of the weight that you have, you sort of had set the bar at a certain level but going to the training session, you realize that you can actually do more in terms of like weights.
12:24:02 Were there anything else that stood out this week that you want to share that with the success for you. You also mentioned being productive and getting quite a bit of work done with with your friend.
12:24:13 Yeah, I think, honestly, those are like my two main wins that I feel so good about because those are the two things that I was like, I don't know if it's gonna happen or, I don't know if I can do it or like how am I going to do it and then I think in
12:24:25 a way.
12:24:27 way. I just like maneuvered and then it happened and I stayed like I stayed consistent like consistent with what I needed to do and it.
12:24:36 Yeah, it wasn't perfect like me staying in was the goal but I was able to like manage to like, Yes, go out of my house, but still be productive and I think that's like such a like I was so happy when I came home because I was like oh like you know like
12:24:50 I don't have to be cooped up all day in order to be productive.
12:24:54 Exactly. I think that's it. That's a very good learning experience or learning moment, right.
12:25:02 What are some other challenges that you are still facing that you would want to address or maybe we could problems around.
12:25:15 Um,
12:25:15 I don't know, I think it's, um, I think it's still kind of like my self esteem a little bit, because I think self esteem and confidence or two different things.
12:25:26 Like I think I'm a pretty like okay competent person like I know I can do it and like I said goals and stuff. I think my self esteem, even while I'm at the gym, it's like harder a little because after I'm done with a personal trainer or whatever like
12:25:41 I go out and like I just do some stuff in the machines are like I do cardio, and I still kind of find myself like comparing me to like the other women I see in the gym and they know I need to stop doing that because I don't know where they started and
12:25:57 stuff like that like subconsciously I know it's not okay but like I still get kind of sad like not sad, but like, I don't know how to explain it like I just got a little bit more on that like I start like comparing myself to other women and I think that's
12:26:13 like not, that's what like kind of hurts me because it's like, like I feel so confident and so good and then I go to the locker rooms and I'm like oh, like, I'm not as where I want to be gay and then a few women who, like, that's where I want to be and
12:26:28 I kind of get discouraged because I'm like I'm not going to get there but yeah I think it's just a constant like I need to remind myself that like, you know, baby steps and stuff but I think that's what I'm working on still is like being happy where I'm
12:26:39 at and like stop comparing myself. Yeah.
12:26:44 There's also this idea, you brought in and I did to my mind about how sometimes we have this like negative self talk that we kind of say to ourselves.
12:26:55 Have you heard about, like, positive affirmations or just affirmations that you say to yourself, because it might be a good idea like anytime, like, just be aware of your thoughts and anytime that a similar thought kind of creeps up.
12:27:13 I would say you know like, take it down with an affirmation of, you know, I am on my own journey and I will get to where I need to be when, when I need to.
12:27:23 Those reminders I think are good to take into account too, because you you even brought it up yourself about how you don't know where, where they started right or the journey that they've been on and remembering that is, is very important.
12:27:38 What are your thoughts about affirmations Is that something that you've heard about before.
12:27:43 Yeah, it is something that I've heard about before, and like I like the messages we get in the morning because those are like really nice to like start off.
12:27:53 Um, but yeah those are those are really important especially because the reason why I want to get stronger is not about the way I look at the way I want to feel so even though I won't look a certain way like I want to look good you know so it's like I
12:28:07 I have to remind myself that like, I'm not doing it to look a certain way I'm doing it because I want to feel better about myself, so it's like yeah I need to constantly like be like okay like.
12:28:19 It's not about like how I love, or like all these things and like, even I think social media can be a little bit like toxic, because I'm saying like, especially because like all like I'm obviously like a woman then I follow like all of these like celebs,
12:28:34 and I'm very into pop culture which is kind of like, I love pop culture but I also can understand that the toxic but not behind it.
12:28:43 So it's like summers creeping around and people are like, posting like summer body ready and I'm just like okay like like and that's not like, like I said it's not important to me, but it's there so it kind of always like gets you thinking about it.
12:28:58 Yeah, it's interesting how I mean, all of these images, create ideas in our minds right they have an impact and creating.
12:29:11 I don't want to call it that dissociation from it, but understanding that, you know, everyone just has a different perspective is supporting but I don't know I I talked to my mother about this and how sometimes as women we need to have this like thick
12:29:31 skin of, you know, things just needs to roll off our shoulders because otherwise, we're just going to like cripple up and be consumed by everything else that the media projects of what we should look like and how we should feel, and the things that we
12:29:45 should do by a certain age. There's so much of that messaging for women that I think it's part of us to figure things out like for ourselves and filter those things so that they don't have as much of an effect or find ways that we can sort of block some
12:30:06 messages for are some. Because yes, as you mentioned those those messages are totally gonna affect our self esteem.
12:30:15 And we see that we see that today.
12:30:19 So, but I think you're taking great steps to address that you, you mentioned, going to therapy and talking to someone about some other ways that that you've experienced this messages, and also just working on your health and your well being, I think are
12:30:35 great ways to tackle those things do you talked a little bit about messages and how you like the messages that you get in the morning, any messages that stood out to you this week that you want to mention.
12:30:51 Um, yes, you real quick.
12:30:53 I know we got a couple.
12:30:55 I got a few notifications of things you like but I wanted to know what specifically did you like about those messages.
12:31:06 Um,
12:31:06 I think I liked the one that I really liked was the one that's kind of more about like your spiritual self. Um, so, I think I responded to one. And then after that it was like another one about like spirituality is a process and it can change and evolve
12:31:25 over time.
12:31:27 And I think I like things that are more like it makes me think about my identity.
12:31:32 I like stuff like and like the health one was also cool because it's like what did I do for my health today and if it's in the morning. It's like what am i planning to do like it kind of gets me like the wheels they can turn, but I like to spirituality
12:31:54 one specific just because I mean I grew up in a very religious family I still am in a very like my family super religious like Catholic ism, um, but over time I realized that I.
12:31:55 It's weird because I do identify as a Catholic, like, if you ask me and be like yes I'm Catholic, but I'm not a practicing Catholic, as much as like other Catholics I guess like I love like the weekend, a little bit and I love saints and angels and I
12:32:07 love like Christmas time in prayer.
12:32:14 But I don't like the concept of church, and confessions, and the 10 commandments. I mean, not the 10 commandments themselves but like the fact that there's like rules and like all of this other stuff that's super, in my opinion, outdated and not progressive.
12:32:30 So it's like, I love the fact that I can identify myself in a spiritual way so with my culture because in a way of my religion is my culture like I even if I wouldn't identifies Catholic, like well status and all stuff like that is tied to that so it's
12:32:46 like I can associate myself with it so it's like I love learning about different ways that I can still be spiritual and connected because I do believe in a higher being and like I said I love all these things, but I also want to draw a line and how far
12:33:03 I am into it so it's like I love identify new ways for myself, and like, casting now, I don't know, I think, is I think you've said it beautifully. And yes, and unless it's a process for each and every one of us.
12:33:22 And just like there's a lot of wonderful good thing sometimes there's something that we could do without, you know, for lack of better words.
12:33:32 I remember many years ago and I was in high school.
12:33:35 And we always have this conversation and it's a little bit unrelated to religion, but it's about nationality, and how because I'm, I was born in Mexico, and coming to the US was, it was difficult to adjust and I held on to my makeup done this, like so
12:33:53 much that being the idea of being an American, or you know, just.
12:34:00 It didn't jive with me and my, my teacher said it wisely, you know, everything has a good good and a not so good thing. The goal here is to take the good things from everything that, that you see.
12:34:13 And that's what you want to keep and keep working on, you know the bad, sometimes we need to just let those things go. But take the good things from every little thing that that is part of you and that makes you who you are, because that's what's going
12:34:28 to make you a better human being.
12:34:31 Right.
12:34:37 I agree.
12:34:35 And that's the same thing that I feel about like being Catholic, I'm also Catholic, I was raised Catholic but I totally relate to you. It's something that I don't practice every day I don't pray every day like we used to when we were kids, but I still
12:34:51 feel like I can do that whenever I want to.
12:34:54 And I feel so much better when it comes from the heart, and I choose to go to church, rather than feeling obligated to do it. Yeah, and I feel my connection is a lot more deeper than that then.
12:35:08 Yeah, I totally relate.
12:35:13 Hey, this is a process.
12:35:15 And it's.
12:35:16 It makes us consider what is it that if you know future generations that we want to pass on to what is the example that we want to give to like the little ones around us if there are any.
12:35:30 Yeah. So, all that good stuff.
12:35:33 Oh, I think.
12:35:36 Any other questions that you have.
12:35:38 Now I think that was basically is a really good check in. Yeah.
12:35:44 I will send you. I'll do my best to send you a little summary before the end of the day today. Okay, and have a great weekend with your family.
