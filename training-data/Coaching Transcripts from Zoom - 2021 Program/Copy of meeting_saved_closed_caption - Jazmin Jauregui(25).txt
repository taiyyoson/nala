20:49:43 I have a project to you for a Wednesday class, but because I'm teaching science I want to hurt input, I'm in like her science class.
20:49:55 Okay, good.
20:49:55 So, society.
20:49:58 Yeah, but it's more of like how to modify a science lesson for English language learners.
20:50:09 So, if I have a scene which I have had like this happen on Wednesday, Monday.
20:50:17 I taught my science lesson and this basically asking students like what does a scientist look like to you, you know, my student who just immigrated from Mexico, a few months ago had told me, had show me a picture of himself saying like, oh you know when
20:50:33 I'm older I want my nose piercing my lip here so my mom told me when they're 18 or 23 I can get appears.
20:50:39 So I had to Tom and Spanish like all know global surveillance in typical but it What does the scientists look like. And then it was like, oh okay I understand you know.
20:50:50 So it's like, what can I do better, to help the poor like will kids you know not necessarily just Spanish you know I have students who speak Arabic.
20:50:59 But how can I support these kids in the science classroom. Mm hmm.
20:51:06 so thoughtful of you, and, like,
20:51:12 yeah animal that's like just a really good, a shift in the education system that that could be useful and help a lot of people. And, yeah, I mean like my experience and growing up was always like, you know, my, my mom drop down in fourth grade and my
20:51:32 dad like once a high school.
20:51:35 Growing up I always felt like I couldn't do math or my work because I couldn't ask my parents for help.
20:51:42 And that was helping me it was always me yelling at him like no like that's not the way we do it in school like you know like what the heck.
20:51:51 And obviously like I grew up and I was like that's not okay. but it's like how do I prevent that.
20:51:59 And how do I help students feel supported you know I don't want the students to feel lost and in the classroom, you know, making them, make them fall behind just because they don't speak English.
20:52:20 Like, if they're in the US like I feel like they will have to understand it to a degree to do well and it's like, How can I support them in doing well in class.
20:52:25 Sorry, I missed a little bit of what you said, Hey, no worries, no internet.
20:52:36 Um, but yeah, I think.
20:52:40 Great work all around and I'm excited to know that you're, or that teachers are thinking in this way.
20:52:49 So, uh, I guess.
20:52:52 For today's health session. This is our second one. So what, how did your health go health goal go for this last week.
20:53:02 I didn't go to the store on Sunday so I didn't have like fruits or vegetables. I only had like one banana here.
20:53:12 Um, I did eat cereal this week until like my last round was like all the series you are eating have like hello sugar ahead tricks.
20:53:21 And then she gave me like, whole wheat Cheerios as she recommended.
20:53:37 Um, I ate out, but it was more of like, not like burgers or anything like that it was more like I had that goes today.
20:53:38 I had curry two days ago.
20:53:43 I worked out today as well.
20:53:48 I took my dog on a walk, twice so far this week.
20:53:53 Yeah.
20:53:55 Okay.
20:53:58 So, on a scale of one to 10 How do you think you did in meeting your health goals.
20:54:04 I think it was a five mostly because this week was like super busy I had to take like two tasks, and then Tuesdays and Thursdays are my longest math homework I'm about to do.
20:54:17 So definitely a five because I feel like I barely got there, but I could have done more.
20:54:24 So I definitely want to go to the store tomorrow.
20:54:28 When I have more time to like, buy things I don't have an excuse this weekend.
20:54:40 Okay, cool. So, um, before we transition to your goal for this week which it could be the same goal.
20:54:48 I just have a couple questions one about your stress. On a scale of one to 10 What was your stress level this week.
20:54:58 I don't think it was necessarily stress, I was just talking to someone about this because I have chemistry last quarter I feel like my stress level was like, That's funny.
20:55:08 They had so much to do by my stuff got done, I feel like if you have at least for me, like if you have a deadline.
20:55:16 But you have so much to do like you'll do it if you can.
20:55:21 Now I feel like I have deadlines, but so much more free time.
20:55:26 On Mondays and Wednesdays that I'm kind of like, I'll do it later. So I feel like my stress level was like a six or seven.
20:55:35 That's still relatively high, like baseline, but it's better than a 20 so I'm gonna like.
20:55:50 Thumbs up there.
20:55:54 Are there any messages that stood out to you that motivated you that you like, specifically, I think I got sad because in one of them. You asked me a question and I didn't reply, because I was like wait, I can't reply because I had to take a test.
20:56:11 And then I was like shit like now I feel bad and now it's like half the day later.
20:56:19 Yeah, that one was just like a check in question. Don't feel obligated to respond.
20:56:27 I know you're like so busy and you have a lot of things to manage.
20:56:32 So, if you respond cool and if you don't like, no worries. Um, yeah I will I won't take it personally.
20:56:43 But aside from the check in message. Are there any other messages that, like the the ones that come in at like 930.
20:56:54 I think the most important one was like, understanding the why behind it.
20:56:59 I feel like most times people are kind of like, at least to me is like whatever like, I'll do it tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow.
20:57:05 But in getting to know the why it's like all right I'm just gonna do it now and get it over with are like this is my goal, this is what I want to accomplish is like why are you doing this.
20:57:15 So, I like that one because it makes you, it made me think.
20:57:21 And then also that's like what pushed me to like exercise today I'm like workout it's like I what's my goal. All right, well it's not just going to happen overnight and like I have to do the work.
20:57:34 And why is also like what makes me want to get up and like go outside and do homework outside, you know, when you text me at nine I'm like, are like at 10, I'm outside doing my homework already and like in lecture.
20:57:47 Because, be in bed all day like I'm just gonna wish my day away and like embed like now know.
20:57:52 Cool.
20:57:54 Thank you. Any other comments on the text messages.
20:58:00 Um, I like that one of them included a picture, but also it doesn't, it didn't just tell me like you should exercise my god so it gave you like a goal of like 30 minutes or something, it was like for you to be healthy, you should go outside and like workout
20:58:19 on like just walk around for like 30 minutes, which is nice because it's like you could make 30 minutes, you know you could do it during lunch, you could do it during your break or something, you could maybe split that up between like 1010 and 10.
20:58:36 Yeah, so I was, I wasn't necessarily like directive like get outside but more like informative.
20:58:44 And then, like you were you, I like how you took it to a next level of like, I have 30 minutes, 10 minutes here, 20 minutes there. So that was really creative Thank you.
20:58:56 Um, so those are kind of like the standard questions I have so I appreciate your patience there.
20:59:03 What were you hoping to talk about or check in about today.
20:59:11 Um, honestly, I thought of it as more of like a huge thing like what do you need for me like, what kind of information do you want to get or what do you want to accomplish, not necessarily like, oh, today I want to go or today I want to talk about like
20:59:29 what my next week thing is, you know, I feel like I know my goals and Alec wants to do better next week. So, huh.
20:59:38 Yeah, so I'm sorry but I gotta throw back to you.
20:59:45 Okay. Yeah, what, tell me about the goals that you have for yourself.
20:59:50 Um, I definitely want to go on a walk. During my lunch, or after I teach math which is around three.
21:00:00 So I definitely want to walk my dog.
21:00:05 Um, I have this app called plants nanny that reminds me to drink water plant nanny. Yeah, I just got another condition right now on nine.
21:00:16 Like this.
21:00:19 Basically you could plant, a plant. Uh huh. And you drinking water.
21:00:23 And you marketing that you drink water is you giving that plant water.
21:00:28 If you don't drink your water every hour or whatever.
21:00:32 And you don't want to your clients your clients gonna die. So if you want you to live, you should be drinking water.
21:00:39 Okay, so you have some water goals.
21:00:43 And I could show you my plan right now.
21:00:48 And it's all.
21:00:54 Oh, do you get to pick the plan. Yeah you do get to pick the plant.
21:00:59 There's like this button called water of life that you could like also, um, bring them back to life.
21:01:08 But let's give you the option if you click on it like your point is that, like, just straight to the point.
21:01:14 And plant a new one.
21:01:15 Okay. Okay.
21:01:18 So I have that but I never drink water like a don't like.
21:01:23 I feel like I'm one of the few people who don't like the taste of water doesn't taste like anything to me.
21:01:28 Like lemonade over soda than I would, but I definitely want to drink more water.
21:01:43 I'm gonna walk, eat two fruits or vegetables a day.
21:01:42 So I want to go like, by carrots and stuff,
21:01:46 My Brian whenever he's been over He will make like a chicken Caesar salad was like chicken and stuff.
21:01:55 And it's like super healthy and I hated without eating.
21:02:02 Yeah.
21:02:04 Okay.
21:02:05 So you, you have three really good specific goals. And so I'm just going to like write them in like the SMART goal format, and then go from there. So, what the walking goal.
21:02:21 In the next week.
21:02:23 You will go for how long do you want to walk for like, What's your ideal walk time.
21:02:32 I feel like that's tricky. I always have the same route and I feel like it takes me like maybe 10 minutes. I definitely want to do more. I just always take my dog.
21:02:47 Um, I don't know I'm hoping 30 minutes, you know like, even if it's like breaking it up 1313. Maybe I could do like 15 during lunch and then 15 at three.
21:02:56 Okay, so go for 215 minute walks.
21:03:14 Put 15 minutes minutes.
21:03:29 And then during the day.
21:03:29 And then once lunch.
21:03:29 And once. What did you say after dinner at 3pm.
21:03:29 After I teach math or science.
21:03:30 Science sorry.
21:03:31 Yeah.
21:03:33 Does your lunch hour stay consistent.
21:03:36 Yes, it's always from 12 to one.
21:03:40 So I'll go ahead and just put talk to them, and then
21:03:47 say, Do you want this to be a goal, just Monday through Friday, or do you want to include the weekends.
21:03:56 I think Monday through Friday.
21:04:00 I definitely could do the weekend like if I go hiking and stuff.
21:04:04 But I haven't gone out like that recently.
21:04:06 That's okay.
21:04:09 Oh wait until after the semester to.
21:04:12 Okay. So, in the next week you will go for 215 minute walks during the day. Once at 12, and once I have three Monday through Friday.
21:04:24 And then for you. What's like the, what's, what's your why for this goal. Why is this important to you.
21:04:48 gain weight like during courting and that was okay with it, but I feel like it's too much so I want to be healthier.
21:05:14 Um, but also like I just hate being in my room like I hate being in my room like zoom calls are here at home I'm like not enjoying my day you know like I not necessarily want to go see people about like I want to be outside of the house walking around
21:05:20 and like actually like seeing people not necessarily visiting someone you know, like, I
21:05:30 want to interact with something or someone you know, if I take my dog on a walk, show like Barca other dogs because she's horrible is not trained.
21:05:40 So like, it's something there's something there.
21:05:44 I always get yelled at for that. I got my dog, my senior year of high school and then I just loved it was my mom, until I came back from college. So I never trained her specifically.
21:05:56 She just barks at everyone, and if you take it to a dog parks, you will not like make friends you will sit next to you.
21:06:03 Oh, yes I know she hates everything she hates everything she's like if you think of a grumpy old lady yelling at people. That's her she will like sit next to me and if a dog or coaches who wants to say hi to them.
21:06:18 Oh, I got a dog. She's his poodle mix thing that I just randomly gone.
21:06:25 It's horrible I randomly just got her.
21:06:28 I'm in high school. My friend was telling puppies.
21:06:32 And I was like, oh, like I want the puppy.
21:06:36 And this is her after I gave her a haircut.
21:06:41 Yeah, she
21:06:49 gave her photoshoot putting flowers on the floor.
21:06:53 What's your name, chickie, chickie, chickie, chickie so with an attitude.
21:07:04 Um, but yeah, I usually when I take out the most. That's like my girl My dog. She's like super super fluffy when you don't know her for. Oh wow, yeah she looks like a whole different animal.
21:07:21 But I take her out. And she like sees a dog and wants to like go after them like one bite them but she just wants to bark.
21:07:33 I take her everywhere with me whenever I can
21:07:40 know. So that's her but then I have my other dog who is super duper traveling, I was just showing my dad.
21:07:50 A video earlier about my dog.
21:07:52 This is the dog that my parents gone, like three years ago.
21:07:57 And so I was here with him. I've been here with him.
21:08:04 He's like, Train like a, you know, sit down rollover Leave it. Wait.
21:08:14 Leave.
21:08:17 Oh, taco. Yeah, well.
21:08:27 And so, like, I gave her, I gave her two Chiquita, she didn't ya know, it's not good enough for me.
21:08:34 Oh my goodness. She's like is it organic meat.
21:08:45 is not from a five star restaurant.
21:08:48 And so I just gave it to copy done, the big dog.
21:08:58 But he also could get aggressive where I don't take them to a dog park.
21:09:03 I don't walk him.
21:09:04 The whole like 1015 minutes that are watching he's his is more of like around the block and then we go home.
21:09:13 armor is going to be like, so bad. It's just walking around with else happy time like muscle, I never take them out the house without a muzzle like I just will not, you know, and my dad does my dad will like walk them out, I have a moves but he's just
21:09:31 like horrible like he used to call me he liked me once when he was younger and I had to like train them out of that you know.
21:09:41 So, I just don't want to risk it I took him to school as a puppy. When he went to my job site.
21:09:49 When I worked at my job sign, and a student loan approach them, and my dog like try to bite them, and never again I was not to you, anywhere without a muzzle like he knit like try to like bike not anything aggressively but I was like no like I cannot
21:10:06 hear anyone else in danger let them know.
21:10:11 I felt a smart move and also.
21:10:14 I mean, in our culture, we just like two people left and right and so you just don't want to miss that.
21:10:36 Okay, so I'm here.
21:10:43 We have your first off gold down. Oh no, I think you froze.
21:10:36 I frozen but I hear you.
21:10:37 Oh, that's great. Okay.
21:10:40 Um, we have your first health goal down.
21:10:45 And I think, like, I'm excited about this one too because people who have set like these walking gold before have like a lot of like positivity the next week they're like, so I'm excited to like, see how this goes for you.
21:11:00 And then, so it's going to be five days Monday through Friday. Is there anything that I can do to like help you achieve this goal. For example, like, text messages or Google Calendar invites, anything like that.
21:11:17 I think the text messages help my classrooms run from like 10 to 1215. So it already cuts 15 minutes into like my lunch, making it like 45 minutes. And if I were to like walk at 1215 that's like now my lunch is like 30 minutes and if I have to cook or
21:11:36 whatever, you know um so what I tried to do is hook, like making myself like some eggs in the morning or something, so that way I like don't have to cook for lunch.
21:11:45 I could just go on the walk.
21:11:47 But the messages definitely help prevent like asking like have you gone on a walk. Yeah.
21:11:54 I want to lie to you and say, Yeah, I did.
21:11:59 Yeah.
21:12:01 Cool. Yeah, I'll make sure to get those messages.
21:12:05 And then so.
21:12:06 So you technically are going to start tomorrow. And then, up until next week.
21:12:13 Okay.
21:12:14 And then, on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
21:12:21 I think it's like an eight eight or nine, I believe next week.
21:12:26 I'll have so much to do. And this super backed up because I got my second job good job.
21:12:32 Yeah, I got it over the weekend and so I like just fall asleep all Saturday and Sunday.
21:12:37 And I like missed out on a lot of like homework time and studying time next week should be better.
21:12:46 How are you feeling from it, what
21:12:52 you're not blowing I promise I'm just tired.
21:12:54 I feel okay, I overslept today. I feel okay um, I just got tired, I had visor.
21:13:03 And so my arm was sore for like the first two three days.
21:13:06 But I was just super super tired my first shot I fell asleep for like three hours. This next shot, I was just tired the whole day like I fell asleep early.
21:13:18 I woke up a little bit late.
21:13:21 I didn't want to do anything and just leave them but.
21:13:27 But that's it, my friends Gah, Medina, and they said that the side effects are like horrible where they like, get chills and fevers. Yeah,
21:13:38 apparently like someone called your doctor and I was like, Oh yeah, that means your body's like getting used to it so you should be fine.
21:13:46 Yeah, it was mandatory bed rest for me and I was like, I don't hate it.
21:13:55 Okay.
21:13:57 So, feeling good about the first goal.
21:14:00 The second goal was around water.
21:14:05 Hello. What a meeting.
21:14:10 And that will revive my plan so when we meet on Thursday, my plan will be alive.
21:14:16 So in the next week you will, and then did you say eight cups of water.
21:14:21 I didn't say that but I could do that, yes, or what what makes no sense to you, I think that works I think that's what my plan needs so eight cups of water a day.
21:14:32 Yeah.
21:14:34 And then do you want to do it for all like seven days five days. Um, I think for this one, they should aim for all seven days.
21:14:45 Like even look like meals,
21:14:49 drink a cup of water every day.
21:14:54 And then, so I guess one strategy is like drink one before every meal is always said, Yeah, or like during the meal.
21:15:03 So, to help water during the day.
21:15:11 And then let me see.
21:15:18 Do you feel like you can easily track eight cups of water.
21:15:24 Yes. Okay.
21:15:29 Um, because this is a joke but like a little shot glass is not equal one couple flutter.
21:15:35 That's what I was going to use. Yeah.
21:15:38 So making sure like it is a clear cup of water. Okay.
21:15:44 And then for you. I mean, maybe it's as simple as keeping your plan to live, but why is this.
21:15:53 Why is drinking a cups of water every day important to you.
21:15:57 I think besides the fact that like, it helps you get healthy it's also like hydrating you know like I feel like lately my skin has been super dry. I just not like because of the heat because it's been cold lately.
21:16:09 And then, also, like me not getting enough water, and it also helped me like get rid of sugar like from coke from sodas from like lemonade.
21:16:18 I.
21:16:20 A few years ago, like started reaching for eliminate instead of coke, even though like lemonade has more. How sugar as well.
21:16:27 But I think this is a way to like, eliminating, and it also drink coffee and coffee dehydrates you so you need water to balance it out.
21:16:40 Yeah. I know you mentioned like not being like the biggest fan of water.
21:16:44 Have you tried like adding just plain lemon to water.
21:16:50 I have and I don't like it I like have done like cucumber and stuff or like other fruits, but I think it's also just like the time to go. Give her whatever food I want to do and like not add it in my cup and like cutting it up, which sounds like a lot
21:17:07 to me but it's honestly not.
21:17:09 but it's honestly not. Yeah, I know they have a. People are so creative there's like no water bottles that like help you infuse your water with like, remember me and all that.
21:17:18 We don't need all that extra stuff, but the other suggestion I was thinking of is like making like a big batch of ice tea.
21:17:28 And like, with just no sugar, and so it would be tea flavored.
21:17:34 I don't know if that was.
21:17:38 I don't drink tons of tea like I will not drink if I don't have to like if I'm not sick I want drinking.
21:17:49 But there are like Starbucks.
21:17:49 Hmm.
21:17:56 the season I like from Starbucks I also can hear you I was like I don't know if he said something.
21:18:03 Oh, okay.
21:18:05 Yeah.
21:18:06 Um, so it might be like a lot of work to get to Starbucks and, and by those t so we can just will stick to plain water.
21:18:18 I don't know if there's anything that we can make it more enjoyable to deal with it which is fine.
21:18:28 Okay.
21:18:28 So, In the next week you will drink cups of water every day.
21:18:41 Let's see, D. Is there anything that I can do to help you meet this goal. No, I think this one's more of like me doing it because it's like waters right there. You know like water is right there for me to grab, I could drink it on on my walk.
21:18:54 You know like water is right there for me to grab, I could drink it on on my walk. I could take a water bottle with me while I go to the store or something you know drink it in the car, like water is like super accessible so I have no reason not to do it.
21:19:10 I'm just send you like does the app, send you notifications like throughout the day. Okay. Yeah, you could schedule your notifications to be like, every two hours or every hour or something.
21:19:26 Cool.
21:19:28 So, what's your confidence level and meeting this health goal.
21:19:34 It's like a low six but I'm hoping to do, it doesn't mean that like I want it just means like like to do I have to do.
21:19:45 But I'm confident that like once I get over the first two days I should be fine.
21:19:50 Okay, so your confidence may increase.
21:19:54 After two days. Yes.
21:20:00 I'm so the other thing I was just going to offer you is like if it happens, you're like It's day two, and you're like, Jasmine I can't get through these eight cups a day, like we can definitely adjust your health goal to be something more obtainable or
21:20:16 something you do feel more comfortable with that being said, you do have three health goals, and we're going to do the third one now. So, this one just kind of falls back.
21:20:27 You still got two more to like, okay, yeah. So, let me see the last helpful you had was around eating fruits or vegetables.
21:20:41 Um, so, in the next week.
21:20:45 You will.
21:20:51 Anyway, I like this because I feel like now I'm telling you, so I have to hold myself accountable. not just like who you hold me accountable.
21:21:12 At the very least, and that is Monday through Friday. Um, yeah.
21:21:34 If not, I will incorporate some kind of fruit or vegetable into my meal.
21:21:37 Okay, so if you will incorporate them into your meal, somehow.
21:21:49 And then, how do you hope to track this.
21:21:57 I think because it's only two a day at the very least, it's easy for me to keep track like I could do one in the morning and one in the afternoon, like as soon as I wake up and gold side, I try to like eat a banana, or whatever fruits they're like well
21:22:13 there is an orange.
21:22:15 After I come back from like a walk.
21:22:19 I could eat the other one.
21:22:33 I'm so for this one. And would it be, what is there anything that I can do to support you during I don't my questions are not. They're all the same, but just focusing on like, Oh how I can help you with this.
21:22:46 Um, no, I don't think so I think that like, I'm able to hold myself accountable on this. I think I could also like ask a friend to do the same thing with me so they and I can like, hold yourselves accountable, which is what we were doing like did you
21:23:03 work out today did you go on the wall kind of thing.
21:23:06 But I think like I could do this one itself.
21:23:10 Okay, cool.
21:23:12 And then a confidence level.
21:23:17 Um, I think the same like a six or seven.
21:23:24 Okay.
21:23:26 So, um, any questions.
21:23:30 No, no questions I was gonna say like I feel like this is also one of those things I could eat in the car, I'm driving somewhere, or like when or you know like even having a next to me.
21:23:44 I think the fruit options that you did provide a really like easy to do that like an apple. He just grabbing go orange you just peel and eat.
21:23:55 Same with a banana.
21:23:58 Okay, sorry. Can you remind me what area you live in. I live in East Palo Alto.
21:24:03 Okay, so like I'm sure there's like farmers markets around.
21:24:10 Yeah, there's one that Paul, I'll toggle. Yeah. Yeah. Have you been to one before. I have been to them. Um, I don't know if they're open right now on the, on the weekend do to cope it, but I could definitely like drive up there on Sunday to see if they
21:24:25 are.
21:24:26 Yeah, I think, then I love big fan of the farmers market fruit, fruit specifically like strawberries are in season, and they're just like, so sweet.
21:24:42 Um, so yeah, I'll just say my go to farmers market.
21:24:49 And then,
21:24:53 so for next week. I was hoping we can find another time to me because I did have that conflict.
21:25:02 And you said you were available Wednesday after a got Wednesday after eight I'm available. I have time for like 310 to 340. I think every single day.
21:25:16 Mondays, I have the most availability as well. I'm free like right after 330, the rest of the day.
21:25:24 Okay.
21:25:27 Um, I'm a little concerned about meeting on Monday, because that doesn't give you the super quick for the goal. Yeah.
21:25:34 The, the other option, so I do have eight o'clock or 830 on Wednesday.
21:25:41 Or we can meet Friday evening around six o'clock, but I know that's like Friday.
21:25:48 Sure, it's a pandemic but like if you have plans, I know maybe you don't want to meet with your health coach.
