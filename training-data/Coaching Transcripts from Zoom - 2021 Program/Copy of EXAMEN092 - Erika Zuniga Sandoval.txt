11:01:36 Hi, I have a connection issues worries.
11:01:46 Well thank you for joining me this morning, Sarah.
11:01:50 My name is Erica, and I will be your health coach for the next four weeks. I'll start by providing you a quick introduction and about the program itself and then we can
11:02:04 go into setting goals for your health, working on your health goals. How does that sound. Perfect, thank you so much. Thank you.
11:02:14 So one of the things we kind of close some of these window so I can have more space. So as you've noticed the examiner intervention is sort of a two part project.
11:02:29 One aspect is the health and wellness text messages, which you are receiving already, and you should be getting those daily.
11:02:38 And the second part of it is the health coaching so meeting one on one with me and my role as your health coach will be meeting once a week for at least 20 minutes if we need more time then then we can definitely work that out I usually schedule.
11:02:53 Each session for 30 minutes just in case anything comes up.
11:02:58 During that time, we'll check in about the daily text messages, what your thoughts have been on them if any of them have motivated you to do any of the activities or suggestions.
11:03:13 We'll talk about weekly goals that we're going to. And I'll tell you a little bit more about that later. And also be asking you about your stress level and sort of how stress you feel from week to week, and I will be following up with you through text
11:03:25 I will be following up with you through text messages in between our sessions just to see how things are going and get an idea of how you're progressing.
11:03:37 If at any point, there's like questions or topics that come up that I feel are outside of my scope of expertise as a health coach. I will let you know.
11:03:42 And that way I can help you to get connected to appropriate resources.
11:03:48 So this is a research study Yes As you might have noticed with all the paperwork that you had to fill out. Thank you so much for doing that.
11:03:56 However, we're going to collect data, any specific conversations will be kept confidential and any data that we do gather, or transcripts will be the identifier, so they won't be associated with your name.
11:04:11 So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with.
11:04:16 By the end of the four weeks, we do hope that you gain skills around problem solving goal setting as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual your mental and your physical health.
11:04:29 So I really want to thank you for taking the time to participate in this program. Your participation will really help us to be able to understand how we can better support Latino students at USF.
11:04:41 And whether we can actually scale this program to a larger number of students.
11:04:47 Do you have any questions before I can know I'm really excited and I, when I received the email I thought, yes this is exactly what the community at USF means, you know, particularly women we need this kind of space so I'm very happy.
11:05:25 I'm glad that you see it that way and that you saw it as an opportunity to participate in something that can create long lasting impact or community.
11:05:16 So before I jump into the messages themselves I do want to ask you, what are you hoping to tell me a little bit more about yourself, and also what are you hoping to check in about today.
11:05:28 What are some of the focuses that you want to have this week and as we move forward.
11:05:37 What are your thoughts. Yeah.
11:05:41 So a little bit about myself.
11:05:44 I'm finishing my master's degree right now, and environmental management.
11:05:49 And that's my second degree at USF my first one was a Bachelor's in international studies.
11:05:57 I'm right now, you know I'm finishing this masters and wondering where I should be where I should go work wise career, more education.
11:06:20 So, you know, I can see the end of the chapter and the stress levels are increasing, because, um, well on the one hand I need to make sure that the thesis is done and ready in the next month.
11:06:36 So, I do, you know, I was diagnosed with diabetes type one that was six years ago already.
11:06:48 And it has an impact on, you know, well, how much I care how much I think about my health.
11:06:57 On a daily basis.
11:06:59 And so I've learned a lot, but there are some areas where there's consistency is missing. So let's say that I feel fine. I mean, you know, good days, oh I don't need these tools.
11:07:13 And then everything when everything comes up, and I think, oh, when was the last time I took 20 minutes to meditate or, you know, so it's this game of you know getting into the flow and out of the flow, and I think we all do that cycle.
11:07:33 And so what I really hope to achieve, you know, In these for next week's.
11:07:42 Is this consistency, right to have to establish a routine.
11:07:48 and
11:07:52 a routine of non negotiable is because, you know, we don't think about oh let's get a shower Let's eat.
11:07:59 But, hey let's check in with myself, where am I added, what really attracted me in the language that you used as part of the research, you know the the questions.
11:08:12 You know the questions. The first questions that I received was the spiritual, and I thought that was really interesting because I'm constantly thinking about my health and what I eat and how much I move and if I you know had enough exercise and with
11:08:25 the spiritual side is so important to me and somehow it just went into, you know, that section of like, oh, perhaps it is the full moon I remember, reconnect.
11:08:37 Right, yeah. You get the picture.
11:08:41 Now I totally get it, I actually think it's something that especially as lesbian women we tend to be very conflicted about either we are at one extreme of spirituality or at the other.
11:08:53 And I really want to make sure that during this program. Our goal is not really to move you to one or stream or the other is really to find a middle ground that helps you stay grounded and that helps your well being.
11:09:09 And so the the idea of excitement itself comes from like the Jesuit tradition to stop and reflect on where we are and where we want to go, and also how do we impact the world around us as human beings right and being mindful and pressing, but also how
11:09:31 do we help our community at the same time. And in those areas. So I think you do bring up a great point that at times, spirituality sort of just gets left behind.
11:09:44 And it's, it's not necessarily a bad thing. There's a lot of other things that we want to focus on, but learning to maybe weave it into the things that we do on a daily basis can really help us to sort of keep it all together, right.
11:10:01 I agree, I agree. Absolutely. Beautifully said, Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Okay, so that's good. So you mentioned a little bit about stress already.
11:10:10 So if you had to write your stress level for this week that you just had on a scale of one not stress to 10, very stress how would you what number would you give it all those questions with numbers, the most difficult to answer, because I think it's a,
11:10:29 it's, it's a flow, right, it's a flow of, in and out, I think there are parts of the day where I feel more stress than others.
11:10:39 You know, typically I'm not going to be stressed.
11:10:47 In the morning I wake up and I I do my thing so I get into, you know, the mindset of what needs to be done. But I would say that I have moments in the day we have peaks of stress, and those could be categorized you know between seven and 10.
11:11:05 And then I have a couple of moments in the day, which are fewer.
11:11:10 But I do have moments where I'm 100% present, and in the moment. And I would say that perhaps the highest you know is three. In those times of fees, peaceful moments and typically that's when I'm taking my time to go on a walk outside or answer girlfriend
11:11:35 you know and catch up with her.
11:11:38 So, I would say.
11:11:41 There's a variation, the average, I'm rather stressed because it's April I need to finish this thesis. So, I would give it an average of six or seven.
11:11:56 Yes.
11:11:57 I think you you I was going to ask you I was getting to that what would be your average.
11:12:03 So you get you get right to it.
11:12:06 So in a similar question would be, I know you mentioned that you you have goals that you set for yourself already so I guess I'm thinking of a baseline.
11:12:16 The current goals that you have for yourself. If he also had to give him an average of how well you're doing meeting those goals on a scale of one to 10.
11:12:25 What would you give it.
11:12:29 So I would say that lately, my focus has been on getting the amount of exercise.
11:12:38 It has been easier just because you know Spring is coming, and honestly, for me it makes it hard to Prince to see the sun, and to be able to step out.
11:12:48 So I would say that on the exercise. Go.
11:12:53 I've been, you know, between eight and 10. In the past three weeks I've been really excellent at keeping you know like my one hour of of walking out whether it may be walking or polarities or weights.
11:13:10 So that has been really really constantly and positive, Then meditation comes in and out.
11:13:19 And it's very important to me it's not something that I want to say that I do, you know it's something that for me.
11:13:27 I know it keeps me grounded and I know how important it is to me so I would say that that has been
11:13:36 lately, I would say, perhaps I meditate once or twice a week for 20 minutes.
11:13:43 I would give it a for, you know, like that's definitely not as often as I would want to be I really want to make it a more of a daily practice and not a you know weekly happening.
11:13:56 And then the third one has been being more
11:14:03 mindful of what I eat because when I'm stressed, I do tend to overeat.
11:14:09 And now I'm bad things.
11:14:11 By, there's nothing bad or good, but I'm diabetic. So, you know, it's.
11:14:17 I've been making sure
11:14:21 that I've been over eating.
11:14:24 I'm in the past two weeks I've been more mindful when I sit I you know try not to get too distracted or,
11:14:33 or just serve myself and then if I'm still hungry perhaps go on a second, instead of like piling up the food and things like that, you know, but I was it has been better.
11:14:42 Six, you know, six or seven.
11:14:47 For some reason on the weekends I instead of like a cheat meal, it becomes a weekend.
11:14:56 So those would have been the three, I think, goals, Yeah.
11:15:17 So in thinking about this upcoming week, and in setting goals, our goal is going to be to set up a SMART goal so these are goals that are going to be as I mentioned Specific, Measurable, Attainable relevant because we want to make sure that you're able
11:15:19 to do it and also time me so there will be a time associated with it. So for example, we need.
11:15:25 Today we're meeting on a Thursday.
11:15:27 How does next Thursday look for you at this time. Perfect.
11:15:32 So my goal is that we could just have a recurrent meeting on Thursdays at 11.
11:15:37 That way every week we can check in and see how you're doing with your with your goals. So you mentioned that you're working on quite a few things.
11:15:52 Which of those would you want to play some more of an emphasis for this week.
11:15:56 motivation.
11:15:56 Okay, yeah.
11:15:56 And what do you what exactly do you want to do with it as like how much time how many days.
11:16:03 So I want to make it a daily.
11:16:09 A daily habit.
11:16:13 And I'm comfortable with 20 usually 20 it's, you know, not.
11:16:19 I build the muscle to get to 20. I would say that I could do more, but in order for it to happen on a daily basis I would rather you know go with the secure 20 rather say daily is that, like Monday through Friday.
11:16:36 Are you also thinking Saturday and Sunday.
11:16:40 I'm also thinking about Yeah, thank you. I'm also thinking about Saturday and Sunday. Okay.
11:16:49 Yeah.
11:16:54 And how will you measure your, your progress for this.
11:16:59 That's a great question. I was thinking about that. And I'm not sure in the past, I have used my phone.
11:17:09 For to send you a reminder, time to meditate or something like that.
11:17:16 And I've also worked with piece of paper where I just cross the do it I don't know if there's another way to make sure you know make sure. Is there any other suggestion that perhaps you may have that's typically what do you use for the meditation, do
11:17:34 you just do use an app. Do you go online and find videos I've done all the above, done by myself. It really depends if I'm having a day where I cannot find my quiet.
11:17:50 I do need guided, and that's where I usually use either an app, or a YouTube video, I have a couple of favorites that I, I use RB.
11:18:01 But if I feel, you know, rather calm. I'll skip the guided and I'll just breathe through it. That's awesome. That is great because I was going to say theory.
11:18:13 If you tend to use guided. Then there's apps that the app itself, you know the will send you reminders about hey it's time to meditate, and you can set that on it.
11:18:24 I mean I typically go with the things that are going, I can go to see every day and they will remind me to do them every day whether it's putting a post it note somewhere.
11:18:33 The first thing I tend to look at in the morning sis my phone so having a, like a warning reminder like hey today you're going to meditate.
11:18:41 Yeah, think of like visual things that you see on a regular basis. That will help you remember Okay, this is, this is what I need to do. The other part I was going to ask was what time of the day do you want to do this afternoon.
11:18:59 And I used to do. I used to have a 4pm, you know, like that was 4pm was my meditation time.
11:19:14 I'm really hungry
11:19:16 for a snack, which, you know, and again Stop thinking about the snack during the meditation so I'm just gonna have a snack and meditation, perhaps.
11:19:27 Well, that's a way to work on our habits, is to associate him with things that we do on a regular basis. Yeah, you might want to do, maybe you want to have this Mac and then you do the meditation, you know it could.
11:19:40 Yeah, I know.
11:19:47 That's a really good, that's a really good idea.
11:19:50 I'm gonna write it here, just time.
11:19:53 And you say associated with something that I'm already doing on daily basis. Okay.
11:19:58 And I'm just thinking as a type one diabetic I know that you probably eat very regularly because you need to maintain your blood sugar added a constant level.
11:20:08 Yeah, so it might be a good idea to associated with after a meal. And I suggest after a meal because if you do it before you're hungry, like you said you might be thinking about this snack and it might distract you from your meditation.
11:20:23 No, that's it that's actually, I don't know how Yeah, that's great. I'm happy we're talking about it. Yeah, really, really good idea.
11:20:31 That's perfect. No.
11:20:39 Yeah, perfect. So,
11:20:39 sometimes it's there, we just need to talk it out.
11:20:42 No, I love it, I love it is it just makes so much sense.
11:20:48 Thank you, thank you, thank you for this week you will practice 20 minutes of meditation, seven days a week.
11:20:59 You can use your phone as a reminder, and you'll do this after your afternoon snack know.
11:21:10 And if you have to give yourself confidence level of being able to do this on that scale of one to 10 how confident Do you feel that you can do this.
11:21:22 This goal this upcoming week is pretty good right.
11:21:27 I think it's good. Yeah.
11:21:30 Yeah.
11:21:33 So you said an eight.
11:21:35 Okay, now I think you have all the components. The only thing I would advise you to think about is, let's say something comes up on one day of the week or one day of the weekend.
11:21:47 What's going to be your backup plan for that.
11:21:50 Because I do want you to think about having some wiggle room just in case things come up. That's it. And that was my next question because I was thinking, that's the only reason why yeah I agree, I agree, agree that's a really good question.
11:22:01 I.
11:22:04 Well, there are two things. Either started the day, and suddenly you know and the more mid morning. I know that something will come in the way of 4pm, but I'll have to answer a call or I'll have to be, you know, I don't know, something an errand.
11:22:19 Right.
11:22:22 And my tendency has been to say okay well No problem, I'll just push it.
11:22:27 But that tendency to say, I'll just push it. That doesn't happen.
11:22:33 And then we're, you know, oh I didn't do it. And I remember at 10pm and all these things so I'm wondering
11:22:41 when I know that it's going to get you know that 4pm it's not going to work with my day schedule.
11:22:49 Why would you suggest Should I just do it.
11:22:52 I don't know, said another time like a plan B time.
11:22:57 What I would actually recommend that you actually start with five days.
11:23:04 That way you have wiggle room.
11:23:07 And as you see it becoming consistent, you can add more days. Okay. And I, if you want to keep the seven days, then I would say definitely have a backup plan of if I'm not able to do it by for this other time will be my, My next time to do it maybe after
11:23:27 dinner instead. Yeah. And if you're finding that evenings are tough. I would recommend maybe after breakfast in the morning.
11:23:37 Because think of the day. Think of your day and what time of it is more flexible to allow you to have 20 minutes aside for meditation.
11:23:48 Yeah, I love that.
11:23:51 And I think,
11:24:01 I think a SMART goals as things that we use to gradually add on things.
11:24:07 And I sense that you just want to go full in that, especially because you you're familiar with meditation and you you've been practicing. I'm not too concerned and also you gave me a really high confidence level.
11:24:23 But I do want to just kind of give you those insights. No, absolutely, and I'm trying to think about, because I used to do it for, I used to do at 4pm, and it really do like the idea of it being after, you know, in this case it's the 14 snack but I do
11:24:40 have, you know,
11:24:44 in the morning, that's a time where I actually get flexible time in the morning more than in the afternoon.
11:24:52 Because my shoes are you know like zoom meetings and make sure that you know I advise my thesis etc etc so I'm tempted to say, instead of having it 4pm having it at 10am.
11:25:06 And then, days that it doesn't work can be habit and 4pm.
11:25:11 You go. Yeah, I think that's a great plan. Okay. Perfect, thank you thank you thank you.
11:25:21 Thank you.
11:25:27 And I love that we were talking about, you know, can be because I mean a lot of life is plenty.
11:25:35 And that's the part of problem solving that that we talk about when we know something might come up, or when we start to realize something might be coming up.
11:25:43 What What am I going to do, how am I going to solve this situation.
11:25:47 Yeah, I think you're on a very good path.
11:25:55 See, covered our goal.
11:25:58 I'll send you a reminder about it at the end of our session or before the end of the day, you should get an email that has a summary of your goal.
11:26:08 And do you need additional resources or videos about meditation or do you have a good amount of resources for that already because you mentioned you have a few favorite one.
11:26:19 I do I do but if you have anything handy.
11:26:23 I mean I'm always curious to discover, but but I but I do, but I'm welcoming any resources that you may have especially I use YouTube to find like videos I just have the guided sound or anything that has like a background, relaxing calm music will help.
11:26:44 I do use an application, most of the time because I do need that guided meditation. Yeah, but much of a guided meditation, by myself.
11:26:58 Like, I'm using calm right now. Yeah.
11:27:01 Yeah, that's the one that I've been using for for some time now and I like it because it always track like how long I've meditated for and, yeah, kind of like if I need to give it a try.
11:27:14 I tried, I know about calm. I tried three other ones headspace at some point.
11:27:26 Okay.
11:27:28 I've tried headspace, I really like headspace, and my, my employer was providing us a free membership, but it ended. So then, you know, get on that something I did the free trial.
11:27:41 Yeah, but what I like calm and calm right now I have a free membership again through this time I think my insurance provides it Oh wonderful, so I would, I would actually mention if you have health insurance you what kind of apps they're offering right
11:27:56 now because especially with the pandemic and everything that's going on, they're really focusing on ensuring that we're maintaining our mental well being.
11:28:05 And they might have resources for you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to check. I did not know. So, yeah, my, my provider is offering, I think it's a year subscription to come.
11:28:19 Oh wow.
11:28:21 That's really important.
11:28:24 That's wonderful. Thank you for mentioning.
11:28:29 Okay. So in thinking about some of the overall as you're thinking of your health journey and your health goals. What would you say have been some of your successes and what are you sort of mentioned a little bit about the challenges that you're currently
11:28:44 facing with keeping it consistent.
11:28:47 But is there something else that you wanted to add around them.
11:28:54 No, I think that, you know, it has.
11:28:58 Every year I get I think more aligned with what works with me, and I'm, you know, keeping myself, honest, I'm no longer trying to follow, you know, the trends and what people are doing just trying to find to what you know feels good.
11:29:24 So, it's a journey, you know, I'm always trying something new.
11:29:25 But yeah, I don't know if that answers your question. I'm very curious to.
11:29:31 Yeah, to discover and find new ways, you know, and I get the sense that you're already very aware of how important health is especially like having a chronic condition something that you have to manage every single day.
11:29:48 Earlier, at the beginning of the conversation you mentioned, I forget about these tools, so you understand that there's a set of tools that we need to have in order to manage our health and our well being and just being aware of when we need those, and
11:30:03 which we need i think it's it's very essential and, and you're very aware of that so I'm glad to see that.
11:30:12 Now we just got to get you to put them into practice. Yeah,
11:30:18 exactly.
11:30:19 And so in thinking about the text messages that you've received so far, were there any messages that stood out to you this week.
11:30:28 I think that the one that stood out to me was the reminder to eat more vegetables, and it stood out to me because it was playful, you know, if I remember going up being told that we needed to eat more fruits and vegetables.
11:30:42 I remember growing up being told that we needed to eat more fruits and vegetables. And to me, I mean, seriously, I can tell if you know I go week about focusing on increasing the amount of vegetables. I can feel it I don't know if this where you feel
11:30:56 a different type of energy. Right.
11:31:00 So it was playful and it was a really good reminder, because I.
11:31:08 It's not the go to I don't know you know, growing up with, you know, my in our.
11:31:26 It's not the focus. Yeah, it's more for decoration. Exactly.
11:31:31 A little thing you know, um, and so I really like that reminder because it's done right of course increase your amount of vegetables and fruit but it was a really good reminder because I do need more support with that, like and reminding myself to include
11:31:47 more vegetables and all of my meals and not just, you know, that extra salad or that extra tomato. So that was a really good one.
11:31:56 And as we're thinking about next week you can start to think, is that something you want to incorporate, and we can build a goals around that next week.
11:32:05 I do want you to focus on the meditation this week. you know that goes.
11:32:10 And then we can add a little bit more.
11:32:13 That will be, they'll be wonderful because I did write. The first one was like daily meditation, and then it has plant based.
11:32:27 So I would love that. Okay, great.
11:32:26 Well those are all the questions I have for you today. Is there anything else that you wanted to bring up. No that's that's wonderful. I love the plan that we have for the week to come and I'm excited.
11:32:41 Perfect. Well, I will send you I think you said, a great goal for this week. I will follow up with you during the week to see how you're doing. And I'll send you a summary of what we discussed today.
11:32:54 Three.
11:32:55 Thank you, Erica, thank you so much for today, and I'll send you a calendar invite for the remaining sessions. If at any point, you need to change the time for any of them just let me know and we can figure it out.
