17:19:16 I do want to ask about like your stress level.
17:19:20 What's been your stress level this week.
17:19:26 I would say, like a five.
17:19:29 I'm not stressing about anything.
17:19:31 This week for this Leah. I'm not stressing about it.
17:19:36 Okay. And then, I'm going back to like your health goals of like that you set for the week which I think was around working out for 20 minutes. Yes, I'm on a scale of one to 10, how did you do in meeting your health goal.
17:19:50 I did him it's on Friday.
17:19:54 Okay, so, on a scale of one to 10.
17:19:59 Um, I would say eight SMS that day.
17:20:03 But, awesome. How do you feel, I feel good like it makes me stay awake.
17:20:14 Okay.
17:20:17 So, that's kind of like the main questions I had for you. But what are you hoping to get out of today's session, and what health goals, would you want to set for this coming week.
17:20:33 And I don't know if this will count like, I, I take vitamins for my hair. But I'm so bad at taking them like I move them to my desk, so that you could see them and I still don't take them.
17:20:46 And I have dummies and I have two other pills that I would like to take, and I am not consistent on taking them so I will like that to me I don't know if that would kind of my health goals.
17:20:58 Take my for my hair.
17:21:03 Yeah.
17:21:06 Um, so yeah so you want to help like establish your vitamin routine. Yeah. Okay.
17:21:13 So, how often do you have to take these just once a day.
17:21:19 Mm hmm. I is a.
17:21:22 I have like three brands that I have the dummies and then I have like an organic one and then there's two more that you have, like, one more.
17:21:31 So have to take three.
17:21:36 So, tell me about, like, Huh, when you've tried to do this before, what have been your challenges.
17:21:48 Um, so I had him near my vanity for my makeup.
17:21:53 And I would see them there, but I was like maybe if I have them, and I would take them here and there and then I was like maybe five move them to my desk.
17:22:00 I'll take them.
17:22:03 I'll be consistent. So I checked them here and there but I'm still not consistent like I'll take them like today and then I'll, I'll see them and I'm like I don't want to take them today.
17:22:14 So I'm like why am I like that like they're right there in the container and take this. Yeah.
17:22:22 So, I wonder.
17:22:25 So you like you see them every day on your desk.
17:22:29 But it's just kind of deciding whether like you want to take them or not wanting to take them. Yeah.
17:22:36 Um Is it is it necessary for you to take all three like is it over. Is that something that's overwhelming you know I think I'm just being lazy to be honest, like, it's just that laziness.
17:22:50 Okay.
17:22:52 And they're right there.
17:22:53 Yeah.
17:22:55 What, What would it take you to overcome this.
17:23:06 You know I think this, I have the Grammys and I'll take them like right away. They just join on them.
17:23:12 And I'll say like having a water bottle, all the time.
17:23:18 With me here, because the pill stars are Bay. So by the time I get up and get water. And I think it's like the.
17:23:26 My issue is not having a water bottle nearby.
17:23:29 That would make it like, boom, boom.
17:23:33 Yeah, and we talked about how drinking water is like one of, like, the more challenging things for you.
17:23:42 So, yeah, maybe, do you normally do, like bottled water or do you have like cups of water, what's your.
17:23:51 What's your primary.
17:23:53 Okay, so like you have like bottled water, and then you just like pick it up and go. Yeah. Okay, So what if we set you up with like to water bottles next year vitamins for the whole week.
17:24:08 Okay. And so those water bottles would just be for your vitamins.
17:24:14 Do you think something like that would be helpful. Yeah. Yes.
17:24:18 Okay. Cool. so the kind of problems out there and we're going to give it a try to see if that was the missing. Yeah.
17:24:26 Um. The other thing that may be helpful is like taking them at the same time every day.
17:24:36 What, what would be a good time to take them like in the morning and the afternoon before your workout like with your protein shake.
17:24:46 I usually take them when I'm sitting down like on my desk. So like around 10.
17:24:55 Once I'm done like with with work, I don't sit back and
17:25:01 so yeah like 10:10am. Yeah, I am.
17:25:10 Okay.
17:25:14 So,
17:25:14 would it be helpful to do some kind of reminder on your phone, or alarm or I can send you like a Google calendar invite, and then the little like notify you.
17:25:27 Okay. Yeah.
17:25:34 Okay.
17:25:31 do, would it.
17:25:33 So sorry I kind of gave you two options the Google calendar invite or like the alarm on your phone or the reminder that you have on your phone. Are you wanting to do both or one or the other.
17:25:44 I can do that alarm on my phone.
17:25:53 Do because that's something that you want to set up now, like what we're doing one second. Let me.
17:26:36 Cool.
17:26:37 So we have the alarm on your phone, and then I'll try to text you just to check in every once in a while, to see how it's going.
17:27:04 So, I'm just to repeat it back to you.
17:27:04 And then next week you will take your hair vitamins every day once a day at 10am.
17:26:58 I have no two bottles of water. Yeah.
17:27:02 And then you also have the alarm on your phone.
17:27:05 Yes.
17:27:11 And then, on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your goal.
17:27:23 I would say a seven.
17:27:26 Okay.
17:27:28 Is there anything that we can do to like, like increase your confidence.
17:27:37 Maybe that Google Form.
17:27:40 Okay, the Google Calendar.
17:27:44 Okay, sure. Totally.
17:27:50 Okay and then did you take your vitamins today.
17:27:53 No, but instead of my desk.
17:27:57 Okay, so, oh that's another, that's another good point, are there gonna be other days where you like maybe don't sit at your desk.
17:28:11 And usually I don't sit on my desk desk on Wednesdays, and I have meetings, but the other days, I do so maybe I will move them to my vanity, which is where I'm at.
17:28:22 It's morning to get ready.
17:28:25 Ok.
17:28:27 Ok.
17:28:29 so I'll just say like move to vanity.
17:28:34 I'm might be helpful.
17:28:38 And then the other place because the other thing that you do routinely is like, um, well I'm making assumptions here but hopefully, good dental hygiene, like you brush your teeth every day.
17:28:52 And the morning. And so, I had another participant who put posted
17:28:59 on their bathroom mirror, and then that would like help them, remind them to like do their help me Okay, so I'm going to add something. Yeah, but I'll just put that in there in case you want it.
17:29:11 Yeah, I don't think I forget is like I said I see them and I know they're there. And I'm just, it's just a lazy port like.
17:29:22 The water is not there I'm not taking.
17:29:25 Yeah, like go get your end Yeah, yeah. Okay.
17:29:41 Every day so seven vitamins obtainable you have the resources.
17:29:46 You do have waters just like putting it right next to it. Yeah. And then, to make it relevant like why is it important for you to take your hair vitamins every day.
17:29:59 I want my hair to grow I feel like it, it has stayed at that link.
17:30:05 And I don't know if you feel that way about your hair like sometimes it's just these there. So I've been wanting to like my hair is long, but I want it longer so I know that if I'm consistent with taking the vitamins, it's going to help the hair grow
17:30:27 you there.
17:30:30 Sorry, I didn't hear you, my internet says it's unstable.
17:30:38 Okay. You're back.
17:30:39 You, you are freezing, I just say that.
17:30:58 I just want my hair to grow it stay at that link, at one certain link, and I want it longer.
17:30:53 So you want your hair to grow, and specifically wanted.
17:31:04 Um.
17:31:05 Okay, so, I think you have a really good goal here. um, any questions about the goal itself or if you want to create a new goal or a secondary goal anything like that.
17:31:29 I would say,
17:31:34 No idea I'm okay with my goal, do plan on continuing the workout goal or.
17:31:41 Yes, I want to have.
17:31:45 I don't know if I told you, like I want to I want Let's get her legs.
17:31:52 So what what we don't have to put it down at the health goal if you don't want to, but I am curious like what,
17:32:04 like, what, what do next steps look like for you. So I know the gym is open. Um, but I'm still like scared to go back. So I, one of my friends was out there and she was like, oh they, they're only getting like 30 people in at a time.
17:32:17 So there's not, it's not like pack. So I been talking to my boyfriend to see if we, if, if we should go back and just work out there, and if not just continue working here.
