13:02:09 Hello.
13:02:14 Hello.
13:02:16 How are you today.
13:02:18 Good, I just finished eating my lunch. Yeah. Sorry about the the time change it's like, it's been a little crazy worries. Today, today actually works because I don't have.
13:02:33 and usually have a workshop that starts at 130, so I need to start the session a few minutes before.
13:02:39 So I'm like okay, we can do today, do one work so today at the end we can revisit it yummy what's a better time.
13:02:46 Okay. Yeah, of course.
13:02:49 Before we we jumped into any of the questions about messages, it's really good to meet you and see you. I know we met over the phone. But it's always great to put a name and a face together so thank you, Jennifer.
13:03:06 And I know last week, your goal was to work on increasing water in tech.
13:03:12 Yes. And how did it go.
13:03:15 Good. I don't know if it was because like since I've been in the process like of moving like it's just been tiring so I'm just kind of in taking on this water.
13:03:24 I don't know if it's that or I just been trying to drink more water but I definitely did.
13:03:40 I know we had said that I was going to drink three water bottles. I think for two was it two days or three days but to a day. Yeah, I actually drink at least like two waters every day so I definitely like pass my goal which was I was pretty excited about
13:03:48 because I've been doing that.
13:03:51 So yeah, I think I did pretty good last week. That's awesome. Glad to hear so on a scale of one to 10. How would you say that you're doing on meeting your goal.
13:04:04 I would say definitely like this past week, attend because I i did i surpassed the goal.
13:04:15 I fully agree I think here on a very good path.
13:04:18 You mentioned that there's still um you finish moving already.
13:04:23 Yeah.
13:04:25 You mentioned there's a few things going on this week so in terms of stress. On a scale of one to 10 How would you rate your level of stress for this week.
13:04:35 I definitely would say at nine, and even though like I'm not like I still have a lot of things to do inside the house like. It's also school.
13:04:47 And we're that just kind of, I would say like a nine for this week.
13:04:50 Yeah.
13:04:52 Yeah, there's a lot of moving pieces, and for today's session so today's session to. What are you what are you hoping to check in about today or what do you want to focus on for this week.
13:05:04 What are you thinking so far.
13:05:08 Yeah, like for.
13:05:10 You mean like my mental health, or just kind of my health goals, or just anything. Yeah, it can be it can be around any of those things. So remember, the goal when we meet us to definitely work on goal setting.
13:05:25 But I always leave it up to you to decide what topic you want to focus on, because then you're more likely to do it. and it's something that you choose to do.
13:05:36 So you mentioned meant to her. Overall, how did you want to narrow it down a little bit more specific to one of those two.
13:05:46 Yeah. Um, I think, probably, like taking care of myself a little more and I'm not sure how that looks like but I think with all the stress like sometimes I don't overeat but sometimes all like start creeping a bunch of things or kind of what I said through
13:06:05 text.
13:06:07 It's for like the soda.
13:06:09 Like for me right now it's like super hard to just like me soda, I'm not drinking soda like 24 seven, because I'm not like I had eggs and soda but it's just like I had the here on the house so if I'm like, for dinner or something I'll just serve myself
13:06:25 like a cup instead of like drinking water or drinking something else like more healthier. So I think, like in terms of taking care of myself and taking care of like my body a little more.
13:06:36 Instead of stress eating or something.
13:06:40 Yeah, no, I hear you. So there's definitely some, some point you made earlier about things you want to focus on. And you had mentioned that the soda and take before.
13:06:53 And my hope was that with increasing the water and take that would actually help you so that you drink soda right because you're now you're hydrated and you don't need to reach out for that, that sort of as much.
13:07:05 I mean it's something that you enjoy and I always say everything in moderation. So if you can just find a way to
13:07:17 to time. I think that should be fine. It's more of not wanting to do it every day that that I hear you saying, but within that you also brought up this idea of taking care of yourself a little bit more.
13:07:33 And that can be done in in multiple ways right that can be done in making sure your dream home, or decreasing the amount of soda.
13:07:41 But you also mentioned mental health and wanting to to maybe focus a bit on that so what happened something that you've done in the past that have worked, and maybe that can give us some ideas of things that you could continue to do that could help.
13:08:01 Um, I think, kind of like in the past, doing more like self care.
13:08:06 I think I find myself struggling with self care a lot of the time so sometimes I'm like God what is no what is healthcare to me.
13:08:17 So I think like I kind of struggle with that a little bit but I think in the past what has helped is actually just having like me time whether it's me sitting on the couch, like watching some TV or like taking a nap or just kind of anything that helps
13:08:35 me not be on the computer because I'm like on the computer like 24 seven. So just kind of disengaging from social media disengaging from like the computer and doing some self care.
13:08:49 I know that's not super specific but I think that's just something that has helped me like disengaging from anything. Electronic.
13:08:58 Let me ask you the area where you live. Is it like walk, friendly, or anything like that. Definitely.
13:09:06 So I'm just I'm just hearing because you mentioned you want to sort of get away from the computer, or a screen. And I find that the best way to do that is like today when you mentioned that if we could push it on my go perfect I'll go for like a little
13:09:25 walk outside, so I actually took like. It took me 10 minutes to get to one side of the place and then nine or 10 minutes to come back so even just 20 minutes of outdoor something.
13:09:36 I think that would be the perfect self care.
13:09:40 And it also gets you moving and it gets you back there.
13:09:44 Yeah.
13:09:47 An idea but I'm sure that you might have other ideas and we can explore it anything that that you'd like.
13:09:54 Yeah, I think, I'm like I do some walks like with my dogs but of course it's not the same because I mean when I walk with my dogs, it's like, oh the, it's like their their walk, so they go everywhere, versus if I were to go walk by myself, it's a little
13:10:14 more relaxing, to be stressing about my dogs barking because they bark at everybody and you know it's not as stressful so I think like walking can help.
13:10:24 I think also something that like has helped me is like cooking. And, like in the past, because I feel like I just kind of like shut down and, and put like this wall and just start cooking and I don't listen to anybody.
13:10:41 I just put like music and I click and I really enjoy cooking.
13:10:45 So that has something else that like has been kind of like helping.
13:10:52 Yeah, I guess it's just I need to like disengage like after a certain time period like instead of like working so late, like I should speak to my hours, versus like just doing more work that I don't get paid for it.
13:11:09 I just do like volunteer work like later late at night I'm like doing work and I'm like I actually could wait until the next morning so, yeah.
13:11:21 Yeah, I mean I feel that especially now working from home a lot of things tend to just margin to each other so we find that we're actually working more hours than we would because you know now everything is just your, your home and if there's some sort
13:11:36 of little time you want to fill it in with something soft it's hard because I think you do.
13:11:42 of little time you want to fill it in with something, sometimes hard because if you do, but yes but I fully agree with you that you still want to have those some boundaries of this work and now this is my personal time, so that we can get adjusted and
13:11:54 used to that sort of scheduling.
13:11:58 Yeah, yeah, yeah I think you're right I think would cope it because I used to be a little better before Kobe, but now with CO bid.
13:12:06 It's like I'm always like working even though I'm home, like I'm always working and then it doesn't help because then you get you want a snack and you start snacking and, yeah, it's all these different things that kind of our rain round, but yeah, so
13:12:22 I know for for today, the goal is definitely to figure out what are some of those challenges that you've identified and how can we build a gold.
13:12:33 So once again, something that is specific achievable and past like that time attached to it so that it can help us to to start making those those changes and your habits.
13:12:47 So what are you thinking of something specific that you could do this week that can help you with wanting to spend more meantime. What is a specific activity that you could do, or a specific action.
13:13:03 Um, I'm thinking maybe
13:13:08 I think maybe like walking alone like without my like my dogs like maybe having some headphones.
13:13:17 Because I mean I walk four times a day with my dogs like for about like half an hour so I kind of least get some sort of exercise throughout the day but it's not I would say it's not something that I enjoy because like I said like sometimes like my dogs
13:13:32 are barking so then I get mad at them and like having someone on the leash show just kind of relaxing and where I moved there's like a little like area where it has like water.
13:13:44 So just like a really nice view where I can just walk along the water, and like, Listen to the music and I think maybe that can help.
13:13:59 I'm kind of in that kind of helps me leave the house instead of always working from home.
13:14:00 That can, you know, kind of kill two birds with one stone. I think you have a great point there so when you're thinking about walking on your own how many minutes do you think would be possible to do or distance.
13:14:16 I would say like something like doable it's like 20 minutes.
13:14:22 And how many days this upcoming week.
13:14:26 I think I was started with three days.
13:14:32 And do you think this will be like a Monday through Friday or you want to use, like the whole seven days to achieve this, I would probably use the whole seven things.
13:14:45 Okay. Are there specific data that seemed more possible than others. That way we can make the goal more specific. like for example, on Monday Wednesday Friday, or Tuesday Thursday, Saturday, or I'm seeing for this week.
13:15:00 Specifically, like a friday saturday and sunday would be more doable for me more flexible.
13:15:08 Yeah. And would you say that this is something that you're able to do in the morning and the afternoon.
13:15:15 What time I the thing I'm definitely afternoon.
13:15:30 Doesn't the weekends I'm not really a morning person. Yeah.
13:15:30 It's the only time I get to sleep and they say, Yeah, please. I like walk my dogs in the morning and then after that I'm like okay and that's good because then it's in the morning you walk your dog then in the afternoon, it can be your, your walk for
13:15:39 yourself. Yeah, then that will you also have that separation to for perfect.
13:15:47 So I have that you'll walk 20 minutes for three days. You have can do, and how confident, do you feel about being able to do this.
13:16:04 I would say, like a nine. Okay, okay, that's that's very confident that.
13:16:12 Is there another goal that you have in mind for this week or do you want to just start with the blocking and see how that goes. Because I know you also have the increasing water and take last time, and I don't know if that's something that you also want
13:16:26 to continue. what are you thinking.
13:16:29 Yeah, I would like still like to continue the water intake, because I think that's something that I'm going to keep trying to do on a weekly basis, kind of be a little more healthy and drink more water because I haven't.
13:16:43 So I would like to keep that goal.
13:16:46 Do you want to keep it the same I think we were doing the two water bottles for three days during the week, did you want to do that again.
13:16:55 Yeah, I can, I think for the water since this past week was a little easier doing that, I think, like, even upping it to four. I think that would be that could go four days, four days Yeah,
13:17:12 the same amount of water right. Yeah.
13:17:16 And then they want attention. Yeah, is mine, I have three but it's only one that just to so high maintenance I'm like oh that's why I hate working from home.
13:17:28 They really are like children.
13:17:36 They want your attention 24 seven. I have friends that have kids I think he's looking at this with their email and yeah you think work is working for moments interesting, because he wants my undivided attention and well I have to work, or sometimes they
13:17:47 bark and I'm like, I am in the middle of the meeting and they start barking I'm like I'm so sorry as a Give me a minute and then I have to like go and close the door like get them.
13:18:02 That's the struggles right now with everybody working from home for your for your goal of continue, continue with the water and take our increase. How confident, do you feel about that on that scale of one to 10 110 to one or one.
13:18:18 And you do really well this week, yes I your message and on my way to go. Yeah, it was like a surprise to my boyfriend was making fun of me because he was like, how was that hard because he actually brings like seven water bottles a day I'm like well
13:18:32 you have an outside job so obviously you're drinking water all the time, you're outside all the time so you're just high and you just want water, but he was making fun of me but I'm like, whatever I'm blocking you out.
13:18:44 It can be quite difficult, especially even just when we're not used to it it takes a little bit of adjustment, a. I almost describe it a little bit as like when we try to decrease the amount of salt that we use because our taste buds get so used to a
13:19:00 specific taste that even water when you start a drink water is like this isn't, you know, satisfy me in any way shape or form.
13:19:09 You know, satisfy me in any way shape or form. I can tell you I have this struggle with my mother. She does not like to drink water, she says it makes her want to vomit and
13:19:18 they don't have, they don't have labor like my, my mom always tells me the same thing.
13:19:23 Yeah. So finding creative ways to even maybe add like slices of some fruit something that makes it fun, so that it's more
13:19:37 exciting to you.
13:19:40 But I mean water by itself it's a good source of hydration.
13:19:47 Things are like culture to like my grandpa, and my, my grandma be just a water especially my grandpa like he would drink like three sodas, a day for every single meal.
13:20:00 And he just didn't believe in drinking water and yeah yeah the popular drink.
13:20:18 The longest Coca Cola.
13:20:09 I was raised.
13:20:14 Yeah.
13:20:14 I mean, Thinking back and even because actually grew up in Mexico for a few years.
13:20:20 That's, that's what we would always drink, and I want to say that, buying coke was cheaper than buying water, I don't remember ever going to the store and buying a water bottle as a kid.
13:20:32 But I remember going to get those like two liter Coke, because, yeah, it's always that's always been a thing like having coke in the fridge. But then I think once my grandparents moved out like my dad was like no no more soda and and that's when I think
13:20:48 I took a pause.
13:20:50 But my grandpa would always like sneaking a soda like oh here like cuz he's like it's not bad. It's not bad, like if you're going to die to die and then now I know like I drink doing so it as a kid.
13:21:02 Soda as a kid. Yes Hey Sam, that is something that I see across so many of our families and family members that that that same thing that you just said.
13:21:13 If I'm gonna die I'm gonna, I'm gonna die or like similar way I'm not even Come on What are you valuable. Yeah, exactly, not the soda I'm like the soda is so like bad for you in so many different ways like, I mean like my dad likes to drink soda like
13:21:28 here in there, but not like it was like my, my grandpa and now my mom's taking that same habit. And then she doesn't like walking and she doesn't like doing these things and I'm like that's why our culture so unhealthy like you guys just keep going, generation
13:21:48 after generation.
13:21:44 We sooner get used to a certain pattern of thing that would, I would say. So it's, I think we're at a critical point that it's, it's important for us to sort of make those modifications that, then we can pass on to like the next generations right so that
13:22:01 they know that things can be done differently and and as I mentioned earlier, with moderation i think it's it's important to just have that sort of embedded in our mindset.
13:22:13 Yes, we can have some, but just don't over indulge, and I feel that in our families that's been a constant struggle of maybe at times we didn't have so much, and now that we do there's this overindulgence of it.
13:22:32 I don't know if that makes any sense. No, it makes sense. Yeah.
13:22:35 At least that I see it even in my family so it's it's definitely struck has been ongoing struggle with them.
13:22:46 I think you have very good goals for this week, you have set yourself up really well.
13:22:53 I did have one more question for you in terms of text messages that you received so far. Were there any messages that stood out to you.
13:23:05 Any that motivated you to do something different.
13:23:09 Yeah, I think there was one in I kind of, I don't know if it was this morning.
13:23:18 I think it was Saturday and I think I put a heart to let me see oh it was on Sunday.
13:23:24 I think just like remind me like of my goals because I think throughout the week like I can sometimes I can forget it like you know I think I have to be more more good with setting reminders like are you actually completing your goal but I think on Sunday
13:23:40 when.
13:23:42 And I think maybe it's just like the whole movie because I'm pretty good with like the things like writing everything down and having everything in my head that I need to do but like I had forgotten for a bit so that reminder on Sunday that I got about
13:23:54 like how are you doing with your goal. How's your progress like it kind of gave me a setback like whoa like I had some goals this week and then I started thinking about, like I surpassed the goals and just kind of like getting us like a question about
13:24:07 my goals and my progress, it just kind of made me feel like oh you're actually following up and carrying it to find followed up through my goal so that kind of helped and then I think the other one that I liked is the one that you sent on Friday.
13:24:24 And it had like a USF picture of it and then it had like a rolls around it. I really like that one too. Um, but yeah.
13:24:33 Um, so I know about a half Can you contribute to a social justice and yeah.
13:24:41 I really like that one too. Yeah.
13:24:45 I think for me, I'm just more. I like more pictures like if I ever want to do a call like I go and find it on on social media and then I'll send it out.
13:24:52 But that's just, you know, everybody has different ways.
13:24:59 I feel that's been a common feedback that we've received about the messages that they preferred photos or images.
13:25:08 So I think that's definitely something that will take into account as we move forward.
13:25:13 Yeah. Yeah.
13:25:14 Very good.
13:25:15 Well, I'm glad that you're getting the messages.
13:25:19 Sometimes we had a few little glitches but everything's going really well so far.
13:25:24 And yeah, anytime that you respond to a message, I get to see that so I get to respond back to you. Okay.
13:25:31 So on Sunday. I actually send you the message about how your, how is your goal going because that's sort of my, my weekly check in with you like hey how are things going.
13:25:42 It's good to just check in and see how things are. But I'm glad that it was a good reminder. Yeah, and I'll continue to do that through this week, I'll check in with you about high goal is going.
13:25:53 I usually give you a few days.
13:25:55 That Will you have some time to try it out and then maybe halfway through the Hey, don't forget.
13:26:02 Yeah. And just like last time I also send you a summary of what we discussed today for the goals that you said, Okay, I'm trying to think if there's any other, are there some resources that you will be interested in receiving I know your goal was around
13:26:17 water intake and I feel I added some last time.
13:26:21 This time, was blocking.
13:26:25 There's walking meditation, but I think you want to start just by walking all together because you mentioned you can listen to music.
13:26:34 Yeah I sent you some recordings if you're interested in maybe practicing some walking meditation, just doesn't idea to. Yeah, that would be that would be awesome.
13:26:48 You mentioned that you like cooking. But I'm assuming you have your own recipes, or do you want that information about a site that has the healthy recipes.
13:26:58 Yeah, I always liked even though I kind of have some of the things I like to cook like I always like to receive like new recipes like it's just so fascinating to me So, yeah.
13:27:11 Okay.
13:27:12 And let me know that's too much.
13:27:23 It might get you thinking about a goal, or the following week because I know you mentioned that you you enjoy cooking. So, it would. It could also be, you know, a plan to maybe try a new recipe your.
13:27:30 Okay.
13:27:32 Well thank you so much for your time.
13:27:47 Before we go next week. What are you thinking, what will be a better time. Let's look at that. Oh yeah, you said no at 1pm next week right, next, next week is the fourth Correct, yes.
13:27:52 I have to start this their session at 115 or so.
13:27:58 I can ask them if I can start it at 120, and then we could do one to 120.
13:28:06 Yeah, or even because today I finish up to a 45 so we can even do 1245 if that works. Yeah, that would totally work for 45 to, like, at least 30 minutes.
13:28:20 Okay. Okay. Perfect. I'll send you an update then or calendar invite perfect yet, flexible.
13:28:28 Yeah.
