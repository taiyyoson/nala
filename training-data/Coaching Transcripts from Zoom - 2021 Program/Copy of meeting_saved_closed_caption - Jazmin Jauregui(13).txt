18:16:17 How was that experience was really good. It was definitely, I was on the verge of like going and not knowing.
18:16:33 Yeah. How long were you there for, um, initially I was only supposed to be there for a semester.
18:16:36 But I extended my state to the year.
18:16:39 Oh my goodness. Tell me more how I like imagine living, we did you live, specifically in France or.
18:16:50 And now if I lived in Spain
18:16:54 family that was in Germany, so I kind of just traveled.
18:17:04 It was definitely nice I got to go to France like about five times within like a month.
18:17:12 Yeah.
18:17:14 Um, I don't know, my, my image, living in Spain, it doesn't quite match with my image of living in France, but I just, I just think about
18:17:28 what like getting baguettes every day, just like eating fresh food that I can answer.
18:17:35 Yeah.
18:17:40 I think I live on a cafe where they had like fresh bread like every single morning and like that's what I would wake up to so it was definitely a struggle to like not get
18:17:57 impatient. Yeah. Wow.
18:18:01 Um, well that's really awesome. I'm like, you had a good experience overall to. Yes, definitely.
18:18:10 Well, thanks for joining me again today I'm sorry about the confusion.
18:18:14 I thought that we were meeting tomorrow, but the turns out that's with someone else so thank you for coming connected with not up there was an error.
18:18:27 I was confused I was like I thought we said Wednesday, but I could be wrong and I didn't know what day it was, that was like let me just make sure before.
18:18:35 I don't have.
18:18:37 Yeah, no thank you. Thank you. I'm also I think my brain or.
18:18:43 Yeah, it's, it's the last couple weeks of the quarter and my brain is a little like white of its calm.
18:18:54 Thanks, I appreciate your understanding.
18:18:58 Um, but, how are you doing how did it go this week.
18:19:02 And it was good.
18:19:06 Holly, like, really.
18:19:10 I don't like all four out of all three I don't remember.
18:19:14 Just because it is like the last bit of the semester.
18:19:18 So, I was really trying to, like, I was, I was a little stressed, trying to figure everything out and still trying to manage like my goals and stuff, but yeah.
18:19:31 So, I'm on a scale of one to 10 What was your stress level this week.
18:19:44 with mine.
18:19:45 Okay. Yeah.
18:19:49 So, would you say that's more like due to school.
18:19:53 Yeah.
18:20:01 Well, going back to your goal. I'm so sorry the scale question first and then I'll go more in like not research question.
18:20:12 On a scale of one to 10 How did you do in your goal. How do you think you did Sorry, I am i mean i think i I didn't like.
18:20:22 I think I could have done better, but I am also very like hard on myself so I think I did pretty good to like also to take into consideration like the stress that I was in like how fast paced, everything was during that week for me So, yeah, yeah.
18:21:05 I'm so sorry just a number. I would say it's winter time home yeah one through 10. Hmm.
18:20:55 So you said five. Yes. Gotcha. Okay. So tell me a little bit about how it went. Where were your successes what were your challenges. I think some challenges for me were trying to find time in a busy schedule to like, focus on, like me, and like my goals.
18:21:16 Because I definitely had a lot of other things that I had to kind of set that those like priorities, but I think
18:21:27 it's not even finding that like determination anymore it's more finding like the balance of time.
18:21:36 Mm hmm.
18:21:35 But yeah, definitely.
18:21:38 I mean, definitely did me at least, like my goals by going, but are they good I struggled to find like time.
18:21:56 Okay.
18:21:56 Um, And then, if I remember correctly, there was the goals around taking food to work right. Yes.
18:22:07 Were you able to take some meals to work on. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think it was like what twice a week or was it more than twice a week I don't remember.
18:22:17 I'm sorry, I would have to look it up but I could if you know no I think I I tried to do it a couple days, and there was a day where like, I even tucked into the office and I didn't eat it.
18:22:30 I just didn't yeah I was like, huh.
18:22:34 But I'm really craving this, so I was like kind of like well self care also, it's been stressful so let's treat myself kind of thing. But, yeah, like the levels of stress that you were under really impacted.
18:22:51 Like my like poor choices.
18:22:54 No, I was just gonna say like impacted you from like achieving your goals, which is totally understandable and that happens like we can't expect life to be smooth sailing 100% of the time.
18:23:10 Yeah. Okay. Well, um, no worries about that. What for the days that you did meet your goals. What were some of the positives that you observed in yourself.
18:23:25 I'm just going to use like a random example but I've had participants who drink water, and then they're like oh yeah my skin is smoother are like I feel better.
18:23:35 Like when I go to bed. So, on the days that you know you were able to meet your goals, any positive outcomes.
18:23:45 I think something like.
18:23:49 Instead, like,
18:23:52 like instant gratification was probably more like me, like when I would, when I did go out and like, you know, exercise, I like came back and I was like tired by like, let's say, 10pm, and as embedded know the sleep early, which made my next morning,
18:24:10 next morning, a lot easier to like get up and, you know, go to work and get my routine going. But, so I kind of set me more like in a better routine and I was like I had energy and then it was, it was like God.
18:24:26 Like everything kind of like what it was a very, like, scheduling, like, they all kind of came together. I don't know if that makes sense.
18:24:37 Yeah.
18:24:40 Yeah, so I feel like it definitely helps.
18:24:44 Like I saw an instant like if I didn't work out if I didn't do those goals. Then, I probably would have had, like, a really like bad morning kind of thing and I had like the morning, you know, so it was definitely helpful to do that.
18:25:08 Yeah, I think what I'm hearing. I wrote down some stuff but reflecting it back to you. It helped you like prepare you for success the next day.
18:25:20 Yeah.
18:25:21 Cool.
18:25:23 Well, that's really awesome to hear I hope that you know making those connections motivates you or keeps you on track to exercising.
18:25:35 At night, but also expressing self compassion when necessary.
18:25:41 Yeah.
18:25:44 So, um, before we are sorry it was there anything else you want to say about your goals from this last week, positive challenges.
18:25:57 Not because it. I just kind of like actually kind of like I saw like me, like, when I do implement these things like these positive things like I get like a, like, it's just like more like set up for like success than I did it.
18:26:13 So I was calling oh ok let's do this more so I don't you know I'm not tired in the morning and grumpy. So, yeah.
18:26:22 Yeah, I think that's super notable.
18:26:26 Kind of like, not like alerts and like the red flashy way but like fireworks like this is awesome.
18:26:36 Cool.
18:26:38 Okay. So, before we transition to talking about your goals this week, I'd like to circle back to the messages and ask if what what what were your thoughts about the messages did any of them stand out to you.
18:26:56 Did they motivate you in any way.
18:26:58 Other comments.
18:27:02 I think I told you this already but like I'm like really like into like info graphics.
18:27:08 So I think this week I noticed like be self care bingo and I was actually working on like implementing a lot of like myself care during like the weekend.
18:27:20 So like I definitely checked off with you and I was like okay like there's other things that I could, you know like, do as well that would be considered self care sorry like that little Bingo.
18:27:31 Canada thing.
18:27:33 And
18:27:36 I love Canada, and then there is.
18:27:40 I think the other one, it was like a,
18:27:44 like how are you kind of sitting here like like yoga pose.
18:27:49 One, and I love that one to
18:27:53 know. Okay, cool. So, um, it sounds like the bingo one also gave you some ideas on like other ways to take care of yourself, and then with the reflection one I wonder.
18:28:09 Did you take a. Did you take some time to, like, like two minutes to be with yourself be present, or it was just kind of like, Oh, This is me and then moved on.
18:28:20 Yeah, I kind of read it, and I thought about it but I actually didn't implement it, I was like okay well like I do some things that I wouldn't really consider self care but are some care.
18:28:34 Okay.
18:28:35 But, yeah.
18:28:35 Any other comments about the text messages.
18:28:41 No I don't think so. I think they're very helpful.
18:28:45 Okay, cool. Yeah. And then, um, so to quickly know your your text messages will and on Sunday.
18:28:56 So, this is the last week that will be doing health coaching but we're still going to set up a health goal. And then following this. Oh, I would like to set up one last meeting with you but it'll, it'll be to ask for your feedback about the program.
18:29:16 I'm to ask for your feedback about the program. So, yeah, let's go ahead and do your goals for this week, and then I'll tell you more about that.
18:29:22 Okay.
18:29:24 Yeah, good.
18:29:26 For this week's I yeah I think I could, like, use the same, just because I don't feel like I like now that I don't have that like I have these like next two weeks off of like school.
18:29:41 I'm like I'm done, I could definitely work on like getting most of it so I think I could keep the same.
18:29:49 So let me look back on our previous week.
18:29:56 I might just take me a few minutes to.
18:29:59 That's fine, fine.
18:30:28 random question are you undergrad or grad student.
18:30:32 I'm a grad student. Okay. Okay. And this is I'm assuming this is for your program right.
18:30:38 Yes, well not necessarily.
18:30:42 So for my program we have to do an internship, and the internships very.
18:30:49 So some people are like working at a UC SF.
18:30:56 Some people are working like other government programs.
18:30:59 But for me, I'm doing this research project with Dr Lingle who I'm not sure if you know who that is. But, so we're trying to see if this program can be beneficial to students, so like getting that feedback, and then also thinking to offer it to like more
18:31:47 I'm so right now there's three health coaches, but our team has, like, five to six people, there's like one person who kind of shows up kind of no judgment just kind of how it falls.
18:31:53 But yeah, so, those three health coaches though.
18:31:55 Okay.
18:32:03 And then I sorry I saw the
18:32:03 main campus or are you at the cuz I know I don't think we have that program that's the Sacramento campus.
18:32:10 Yeah, so I'm, I'm not exactly sure what programs the Sacramento campus has but I do the main campus.
18:32:21 Oh, I know. What about you.
18:32:23 Yeah, I'm up to Sacramento campus I apply for the main campus, and then coven hit, and I wasn't trying to move out there with because I was going to quit my job.
18:32:35 I'm in Sacramento so I was gonna quit my job and then go out there and live and I was like, how am I going to be able to afford rent and don't just go with those.
18:32:44 Yeah, and I was like yeah no I'll just stay here.
18:32:49 Yeah, I actually could mute to San Francisco.
18:32:55 Yeah, I actually commute to San Francisco and live in Santa Cruz, which I mean, rent wise now, any better, but I work here. And it worked out.
18:33:06 Wow, that's a long commute fish.
18:33:10 Yes. Luckily it was just like once, maybe twice a week with the classes, but then coven hit, and then we just got stuck work I know it's always like a protocol and that's all I got like so lucky I was like well I mean it works out I could stay and do
18:33:28 everything on zoom and I don't have to pay for Right.
18:33:33 Yeah. There's definitely been some frozen. a lot of cons, but some pros.
18:33:42 Um. Do you know anybody from Santa Cruz By any chance, I know she lives in Los Landy. So, I know. So I used to go to UCSB how State Monterey Bay for my undergrad.
18:34:01 And I used to commute from Monterey to Santa Cruz.
18:34:05 For my internship as well. And so it was like the last year that I was like, it wasn't that bad but i think i, the times that I went because I used to work at the mall.
18:34:18 At the, what is it the Museum of Art History.
18:34:21 And so, yeah, it was like the hours Burgess weird and it was different days and just like I would get all the traffic coming back to Monterey, and so I think that's what made the commute longer, but it was definitely nice, because I think that, like Santa
18:34:37 Cruz is just very, like, I don't know, it's my vibe, more than anything, it's very relaxed. So, yeah, definitely miss it, but now I'm back in Sacramento and I applied the USF I bought in last year and I've never actually been to the main campus, so I
18:34:58 do hope, will you be so when you start in the fall or do you have classes in the fall.
18:35:05 And yeah, so we're supposed to start fall in person like a hybrid, so like, and we have to go in.
18:35:12 But luckily, I had to reapply it to the program here at Sacramento since I kind of told them like I'm not.
18:35:20 I mean I could have started with that cohort but I would have had to leave, if it came down to like in person I would have to leave to go to the main campus.
18:35:31 And so I would have to now that I switched over, I get to go to commit to the Sacramento one and set up the San Francisco. So it kind of worked out, but I'm still kind of bummed that I actually haven't actually seen the campus but one day, one day, and
18:35:49 it's, um,
18:35:52 it's not like a traditional campus, it's just kind of blends in with the rest of San Francisco. Yeah, that's what it was, I mean I've been to San Francisco so many times, and actually, like, two weekends ago I went, I think just for like, I don't know
18:36:07 I didn't, I ended up going to like a brunch place, and I was like, I saw the signs and then I realized that I was like really close to the campus, but I didn't see like an actual campus, and then I was like, Hmm, maybe it's just like a business building
18:36:23 or something like.
18:36:28 Yeah.
18:36:29 Um, it's really difficult to navigate because of blend so well with the city. I'm the only.
18:36:37 I guess feature, are the stairs, like you know the. Maybe you've seen photos of the like stairs that.
18:36:44 And then they have like a grassy area and between the stairs. Oh, yeah, yeah.
18:36:51 That's the only thing that I feel like makes it stand out as a university, all the other buildings blend in with San Francisco.
18:37:01 Interesting.
18:37:03 And I haven't I don't know what the Sacramento campus looks like so I wonder if that's Yeah, no, it's literally like, I don't know if you've been to Sacramento, but I don't know if you like the golden, not the golden bridge but the yellow bridge.
18:37:23 I'm not remembering yellow bridge but I happen to ok so the iconic like I think like the touristy place of Sacramento and downtown area it's literally like a business building attached to it so it's nothing like our actual campus, it's just like a building
18:37:40 like you'll miss it if you drive by
18:37:44 that's happened to me at USA, a lot of times.
18:37:50 Oh,
18:37:50 Yeah. Interesting, interesting.
18:37:53 Yeah, I wonder if it's like, just because it's a smaller University compared to like, UC Berkeley or CSU Monterey, all the, all those places.
18:38:07 Yeah, but you would think that there's like two universities in San Francisco so like separate What is it San Fran state and then USA, like, be really like I don't know like ology but
18:38:23 have you. Have you seen the CSU San Francisco.
18:38:30 No, I have it, but I had a friend that went there and like their student lights looked like it was the actual campus. So, yeah, I'm sure.
18:38:44 Yeah. Um, I don't, I visited the campus ones, but I got the same by we're just kind of blended in with the city.
18:38:51 Yeah, maybe.
18:38:53 Yeah, San Francisco really doesn't have a lot of land.
18:39:01 That's true.
18:39:05 Yeah.
18:39:04 Um, but I was able to find my notes from last our last session.
18:39:09 And so, you had a look like two goals.
18:39:15 One was to be physically active. For at least 30 minutes on four different days. And then the second goal was, you would prepare three lunch meals for the week.
18:39:28 Okay.
18:39:30 So were those the two that you want us to do again.
18:39:34 Yeah, we could keep it the same.
18:39:36 Okay, so let me.
18:39:38 Let's start with the first physically active one.
18:39:44 And then.
18:39:48 So, it says in the next week you'll be physically active for at least 30 minutes on four different days.
18:40:11 Yeah, I think it's definitely obtainable, um, because I did say,
18:40:22 I think I did three.
18:40:25 Yeah, I went twice the German ones here so yeah I went. Yeah, so I did three so I could definitely reach that this week now that I won't have as much of a workload.
18:40:40 Okay.
18:40:40 Um, and then, is there anything that you need to support wise for this.
18:40:49 For example, Some people find it helpful to set up calendar blocks.
18:40:56 As a reminder, or so that they can manage their time better.
18:41:04 Something along those lines.
18:41:08 No, I think I could, I couldn't handle it. I mean, I definitely have more downtime. So, yeah. Cool. Yeah.
18:41:17 Um, so last week, I'm sorry, go ahead.
18:41:22 Oh no.
18:41:24 Um, last week when we talked about like the relevance of this goal like why is it important to you. You said. This will help increase your energy and be a healthier person, as well as boost your self esteem and confidence level.
18:41:44 Do those still feel appropriate or would you like to add something.
18:41:51 Those are fine.
18:41:53 Okay.
18:41:54 And then on a scale of one to 10 What's your level of confidence in meeting your SMART goal.
18:42:01 I could do a 10.
18:42:03 Okay, cool.
18:42:05 Awesome.
18:42:06 Alrighty, So then for the second goal.
18:42:11 In the next week you will prepare three lunch meals for the week.
18:42:16 Should we add like prepare and eat.
18:42:21 Um yeah I mean we can be specific, I definitely do probably do that.
18:42:30 It doesn't cost them.
18:42:34 Okay, so I did say you will prepare three lunch meals for the week.
18:42:42 Um, the does that still feel like relevant to you. Yeah, that's definitely relevant, but it's still need to work on that.
18:42:50 And then, talking about like it's important.
18:42:55 Um, last week you mentioned, it was part of its importance came from like reducing your purchasing of fast food, and then also wanting to have a balanced diet.
18:43:08 Watch what you put in your body, and live a healthier and longer life.
18:43:17 Um, yeah, that's definitely still relevant. Okay, do you want to add anything.
18:43:23 Oh, no, we gotta keep that
18:43:35 everything is really easy.
18:43:32 Alrighty.
18:43:33 And then, so for the obtainable piece.
18:43:39 Do you want to keep it to three meals.
18:43:43 And yeah, let's not increase that I don't want to know for sure.
18:43:50 Okay, so, on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
18:43:56 I could definitely do.
18:44:00 I'll do it, 8.5.
18:44:02 Okay, yeah.
18:44:04 Alright, Cool.
18:44:09 So, for this last week, when you have this goal.
18:44:15 Were you able to prepare some meals. Yeah, I actually was all the other days.
18:44:24 Except I don't know like i think i well i don't know why but I don't really like when it comes down to it like I don't know I like a meal prep them and I make them and then once it gets like to, you know, like lunchtime or whenever I'm eating it like
18:44:41 I just don't like I'd rather not and so either I don't eat it and then I just don't have lunch or I just go out and I don't know grab a coffee and then I'll just represent.
18:44:52 Like, it's not really.
18:44:53 Yeah.
18:44:54 Yeah.
18:44:58 That's a, that's a tough position to be in like making food working towards this goal and then once it comes down to it. Yeah.
18:45:08 No.
18:45:10 Yeah, I think also because maybe like i was i was really stressed and so like when I'm stressed I like either like I stressed it like when I'm like actively doing something, or like when I'm doing home or something is stress eat a lot or I when I'm really
18:45:25 stressed out I don't eat like I'd rather supplement it with like caffeine which is really terrible but.
18:45:41 So it's kind of like coping as well with like this.
18:45:38 Yeah.
18:45:39 Okay.
18:45:41 Well, I'm hopefully I'm like stressful situations are now reduced, and you can really focus on implementing this goal, like having like those perfect conditions, so to speak.
18:46:01 Yeah, you can eat your noodles, that you could for yourself.
18:46:07 Already, um, any other goals that you want to work towards or modify.
18:46:16 Now I think that's it. My main ones. Okay, cool. So, um, since this is our last coaching session. Do I just have like a couple questions around.
18:46:31 Kind of your experience not necessarily feedback but do you feel that you've like gain something from these last four weeks in terms of establishing health goals for yourself.
18:46:45 Yeah, definitely. I think it's definitely helped having like a health coach, like, kind of like deep you like on track and have like a guideline and like set goals settings definitely beneficial has been.
18:47:04 Thank you.
18:47:06 I've really enjoyed working with you too.
18:47:09 And so with the, with the program we've tried to work on two skills, one around setting health goals using the SMART goals. And then, problem solving, which is like looking at those challenges and seeing what solutions can come of it.
18:47:29 Do you feel. Those are skills that you have grown in.
18:47:36 Sorry said I want my time.
18:47:39 So, for the coaching, we worked on setting like smart goals and
18:47:47 skill or sorry it was called, problem solving, and so try to approach, approach those by building your skills in those areas.
18:47:59 Uh huh. Um yeah I think I definitely like like improved in that, and those life skills and problem solving skills. Okay.
18:48:07 Yeah, definitely. that was.
18:48:14 Yeah. Um, I think about. For me it's hard to do like health goals SMART goal and then like probably use them all on a Sunday.
18:48:41 Big turns. Yeah.
18:48:41 But okay, cool. Do you have any other like questions for me. Um, it could be about school or about the health coaching or the program.
18:48:41 Oh,
18:48:39 yeah, so like I guess I remember signing like a consent for like for like the data and stuff like bull.
18:48:58 I'm sure someone will analyze it and see like how effective it is and like you know whether it you know, kind of, like, gets implemented in the future and stuff like well that that.
18:49:01 I mean, because I think would be open up to like all USF students are like, do you know, like, you know, in the long run, kind of thing, but I don't know I find that very beneficial, at least you know for like being a student and like kind of stressful
18:49:17 to juggle everything so definitely very likable.
18:49:25 And so right now. We haven't started analyzing the data.
18:49:31 But that's the next phase of this probably over the summer.
18:49:37 And we're hoping to establish a program like this at USF. But we won't know until we present to like funders that we can get money to keep doing this.
18:49:53 So the future is a little bit up in the air, but that's our goal is to show are like collect the data, analyze the data and present it in a way that supports
18:50:09 or gets people to support the program for for the future.
18:50:17 And then, you mentioned like having us signing the consent form and having your data collected. Um, I'm not sure if you had any concerns there but your name and your data is not connected.
18:50:34 So, okay, it's anonymous. Yeah.
18:50:38 Yeah. No, I was just worried more of like are not worried but like more like, I guess, questions around like
18:50:48 like the process of it being like presented and stuff but.
18:50:56 Yeah.
18:50:54 Yeah. So we do have some quantitative features like those scale questions are easy to like, Oh, this person set of five, or they said, eight, or 10.
18:51:10 The other notes, which is the qualitative part.
18:51:14 I'm taking this research class right now so I feel like I'm, those are in my head, but you is we code it until we find themes. So like for example maybe people setting goals around physical activity.
18:51:31 And then, this is what they said about that.
18:51:41 Or people found health coaching beneficial. This is what people said about that. So, okay, That's how we look at that data.
18:51:43 Okay. Okay, that makes sense.
18:51:49 All right.
18:51:51 So then our next one would be how far out are like our last one, since this is our last one other ones just like more of like feedback for you correct.
18:52:01 Yeah, so that we can transition to doing that now.
18:52:07 So, this last meeting is for you to provide feedback about your experience, and you won't meet with me you'll meet with someone else. And so you can provide that honest feedback.
18:52:23 Before you meet with them we ask that you fill out another survey, and it'll be a short survey like fit, like, 15 minutes maybe.
18:52:32 And then the person will ask you, specific questions about your experience. Okay.
18:52:39 Yeah, so, um, do you want, what next week be okay for that. Um yeah that works.
18:52:47 I think works.
18:52:50 Um, you want to do six to seven on Wednesday,
18:53:01 six to seven works.
18:53:03 Okay. I'm sorry I forgot to mention these this meeting would be a little longer than our normal health coaching sessions. Okay.
18:53:20 So I'll add you to the invite. Now, and hopefully you'll get that shortly.
18:53:36 And then I'll try to get the survey to be sent to you either tonight or tomorrow.
18:53:43 Sounds good.
