18:15:28 Hello.
18:15:31 Oh my goodness you have some impressive art I didn't see that before. Oh, yeah, those are kind of just like the only real like actual painting is just that one right there and then that when I got in Italy, the rest of these are like kind of bought, and
18:15:46 then that little peacock, I got it like from a. It's so cute the elderly and like this really small town, they they be they turned to art so that's what she painted little peacock.
18:16:02 And I'm like, Whoa, real artists that's like, Yeah, not gonna lie, if I saw that when I first woke up, I would feel a little scared.
18:16:11 Yeah, like I liked it. He's a cool artists. Funny thing is that, his name is Scott Lewis on the bottle and my deal. His name is the exact same name
18:16:25 was a funny coincidence, cuz my other last name is
18:16:38 cool.
18:16:33 Um, well it is awesome, our taste, they are really awesome the one on this side.
18:16:40 I will reserve for a later time.
18:16:46 But, how are you doing how's everything going.
18:16:50 Awesome.
18:16:56 I actually recently found out on a Monday when I woke up, um, I got accepted into this Italian medical school I had applied to.
18:17:06 And in February I took the entrance exam and I got whitelisted and I was just like, okay, like it's fine I probably won't then end up going so I was, I was preparing to do other stuff here but ended up getting accepted after all.
18:17:20 Boom, Italian medical school. Yeah, it's in Milan.
18:17:26 Oh, how exciting.
18:17:30 15.
18:17:32 Students in so that was also like a awesome I was one of the 5090 days like EU students I could go.
18:17:39 Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. So that was like a giant boost to my mood the whole week it was kind of surreal was just like, is this real and then I just felt like my student email and like my other information I was just like, wow, this is gonna
18:17:55 be fun.
18:17:57 fun. How long, how long is the program for the program, they do it for six years, so there's three years of clinical, and then the other three years of where you're learning more in depth about everything.
18:18:10 Uh huh. And they have a teaching hospital and also a Research Hospital. So you can go back and forth between the two.
18:18:19 Wow. So you're going to be living in Italy for six years.
18:18:24 Uh huh. Yeah, ever been before.
18:18:27 I went for like a week during spring break was like for this.
18:18:32 My school did like go abroad, if you wanted to go so I ended up doing it.
18:18:37 And that was my first time being in Italy, and so they took us like the like the tour guide to this like the major places kind of like in each region.
18:18:55 Florence and Rome. But then she took us to like some smaller towns that we can get the feel for kind of like the more you know laid back version, instead of like the.
18:19:04 Yeah.
18:19:06 Wow, I've never been but it's definitely on the bucket list. Yeah I told one of my co workers today she's like oh so when are we moving, she's like yeah we I'm coming with you.
18:19:22 Yeah, that's so awesome.
18:19:24 Um, how did your parents feel about your move.
18:19:28 Oh, they're like off for it.
18:19:30 Um, cuz like I was like a little nervous because again like everything's like finance wise, because it is cheaper to go to school there, but like it is in euros so you know like that's what makes it a little bit more expensive technically, but it's not
18:19:45 that bad. So like for the whole entire year. it's like around 35,000.
18:19:53 That's like one year which isn't bad considering like in the US that's kind of like one semester
18:20:01 Like qualify for in state right so.
18:20:06 So do you have to pay also like additional fees because you're an international student will that's like including everything so that's including my housing, and my intuition and then like the different fees.
18:20:20 Yeah. And the way that they structure it there's kind of like, if you're a non EU student they're automatically going to put you at the highest category where you pay the most for your tuition, but then they make you go through a process of where you
18:20:33 like give them your taxes so that way they can then convert and see where which tier you actually fall into. And then if you drop down and your tuition will drop down by like 3000 euros.
18:20:47 Okay. Wow.
18:20:54 Yeah.
18:21:00 Do you know what you want to study it's like a physician. Yeah, I want to do pediatrics. Is there like a needle needle specialist or just like a pediatrician the ICU.
18:21:10 Mm hmm. That's so cool. I started out my undergrad wanting to go into pediatrics to, I did not get there. So, I think I might have mentioned that earlier but props to you that's so exciting.
18:21:24 Did you have to do the M cat for that actually know they have their own special and tricks exam that you have to do. And then, in a couple of weeks or in the coming months.
18:21:41 I'm going to then be doing this other these other tests, and it's just to make sure that everyone's kind of on the same page.
18:21:46 And then you have to get above a 50 on all three test, and if you get below 50, they'll give you like remedial courses.
18:21:53 And then you test to make sure that you do get above the 50.
18:21:58 Okay, cool, and other classes and Italian are in English, and said entirely English, and it's a US accredited and then their real day that they got certified by the California Medical Board which apparently is like a really rare for international medical
18:22:15 schools.
18:22:18 Holy smokes. So you're going to be a doctor Flores or dr sandal soon yeah doctor was it'll be pretty cool, I was like a little, little nervous because again I'm going to entirely different country well I'm excited.
18:22:37 Yeah, it's gonna be such a remarkable journey, perhaps to you. Thank you. So it's been a good week. Yes, it started off, good It started off because normally for some reason my, my email normally puts them as like junk mail.
18:22:51 And I never you know check your junk mail.
18:22:55 Like it ended up going like not into junk mail and I was so excited I was like Oh thank god this and go to junk mail.
18:23:00 Yeah, it did I would have been like the worst missed opportunity ever
18:23:08 been but the stars aligned for you and you. I'm sure you've worked really hard to get there. So, all credit goes to you. Thank you.
18:23:32 Um, would it be okay to share this with folks from my side of things, because I think this is just so awesome.
18:23:30 Let me find. Okay, I won't say your name, of course because of like the confidentiality and the privacy, but I'm just I'll just say like one of my participants, got into medical school in Italy.
18:23:45 That's going to be such cool information to share.
18:23:48 Yeah, no problem.
18:23:50 Well, I feel like, you know, I have a couple questions for you but they're not going to really meet that bar. I mean, how can you be better than getting into medical school, like that that's like on every like pre med students like top thing to do.
18:24:10 Like a gap year to, you know, for me to get in everything and I'm like, Oh, I mean I'm still gonna be like I would have graduated the same age that I'm going to graduate anyways so that's I'm like, it's not about age either like I'm still going to be
18:24:22 in my late 20s regardless. Mm hmm.
18:24:27 So when do you head out.
18:24:41 Yeah, you're going to hear a lot of stuff, a lot of frustration, but I think there are a lot more relaxed and we are.
18:24:50 I feel like that's the thing with it is that they because of covert and because of like how bad we were doing we're, like, in a certain category. So I had to, or regulations for like, Colin was.
18:25:20 So, in that if I at least show them i have i've been vaccinated, it'll like make it a little bit easier for them to not be so like heavy on like my quarantine period.
18:25:18 I got on my name, but like, at the same time it's like in vaccinated like I'm, I'm pretty sure I'm okay.
18:25:24 Yeah, and also I'm going to be what have you soon.
18:25:29 Yeah. Cool, well, we'll definitely continue to keep in touch about this because this is awesome, like new information. Every week, do, do they have plans to like introduce you to basically your cohort in the program.
18:25:54 Yeah, there's an introduction week, and really like when you get over there. Yeah, like to have like orientation time, but not beforehand.
18:25:56 I think so, for some reason, the way that they do it is Italy their school year is 20 weeks, and like so.
18:26:07 They start in September, and they go all the way into like January part of February, sometimes, and then they start again in February and they go all the way until July.
18:26:19 So like school years out super long, but then I think they just have shorter hours.
18:26:28 Like Italians are all about the relaxation time.
18:26:34 It was like 330 and some stores were closed, and when you asked like the tour guide why she's like oh they're still on lunch break around with lunch.
18:26:46 Like 1230 until 330 like, oh, yo. Take lunch, like yellow very serious about your relaxation times. Yeah.
18:26:57 Yeah. In America, we're like, oh you have lunch cool I had to work through my lunch. Yeah, like 30 minutes like eating real fast too, huh. Yeah.
18:27:10 Yeah. Okay, so I'm hoping, like the quality of life is also technically better over there like it's much more relaxed. So, cuz like you know brings a lot of stress being in medical school so hopefully that kind of balance will be like okay I can, I can relax
18:27:24 a little bit like, okay.
18:27:28 Oh my goodness, so jealous but so happy for you.
18:27:36 I'm sorry. Is it okay to ask you these like boring questions. Yes.
18:27:43 Okay, so the first one I wanted to ask about was about the daily text messages.
18:27:51 What are your thoughts around those have any of them, stood out to you.
18:27:57 Um, they're actually pretty helpful, um, Let me see which one.
18:28:04 Oh, like there was one where it was a text about
18:28:11 our is like about like your spirituality, and then I was like oh like we forget, I remember like when I was younger, we talked about like the human is more than just like your physical it's also like mental, spiritual and then just like different you
18:28:25 know we're like 3d people like we don't just, we're not just 2d we're not just about one thing.
18:28:47 Um, so spirituality law is really big. And like sometimes when you ignore I think certain parts of yourself, you're kind of just like. And I feel like it doesn't it doesn't help you open yourself up as much as he could be.
18:28:56 Remember, because like as mentioned meditation and yoga and I've been trying to do more yoga, one for flexibility but second cousin, relaxing to just kind of like I don't know stretch.
18:29:06 Yeah, I can see why cats like to do this often.
18:29:11 And then there was one where it was like what saw this gift fruits and vegetables help lower cholesterol and then I was like, yeah, that reminds me I needed to get some fruit, and sure enough there was fruit in the break room and I was like debating I'm
18:29:23 like, I don't know.
18:29:25 Sorry, so I was like okay this is this is my sign I need to eat it.
18:29:32 It was a secret little messy.
18:29:36 We did talk about like my vegetable intake a little bit more.
18:29:41 to talk about like my vegetable intake a little bit more. Oh, I, I attempted to eat more cherry tomatoes because it was like in one of the. They gave us for like, you know, I was like, let's just let's just a couple of them I guess I can attempt to eat
18:29:52 them so that and like you know some mushrooms and.
18:29:57 What is it, broccoli, that's really good stuff. Also, be prepared to eat a lot of tomatoes.
18:30:04 Yes.
18:30:06 Okay, cool. Um, so your again your continued and get a bunch of those messages for or three more weeks now, I think.
18:30:18 And you're welcome to respond to any of them. So like I said I'll be on the other side of are on the receiving side.
18:30:27 And then another question for you is around your stress level.
18:30:40 It's one of the scale questions, so like what was your stress level this week, on a scale of one to 10 or 10 is like stressed is
18:30:52 like a six to seven because, again, like, once I got, I was happy but then I say time it's like, oh, and I have to worry about like all this other stuff.
18:31:04 Like how I'm going to get there. I'm going to talk about my stuff my immigration stuff and I'm like, yeah, maybe one day at a time with me things yeah hopefully they you have like a advisor of some kind that can help you process, they really thought of
18:31:23 everything.
18:31:23 They respond really quickly Sue and I was like Oh that's good like quick response for me.
18:31:32 Yeah.
18:31:32 Um, and then going back to your health goals, how do you think you did and meeting your health goals on the scale of one to 10 where one is like not so great and then 10 is really awesome.
18:31:45 I think it did about like an eight.
18:31:47 Okay. Do not tell me a little bit about like, why not a nine or 10.
18:31:55 I guess so I did do the two the two miles for like those two days. And then on the third day as one a little bit more sluggish. And then so I didn't jog the two miles I ended up jogging just like one mile, but I kind of made up for it in my way by helping
18:32:13 my mom like move around some stuff like doing some yard where we were like moving on.
18:32:19 Picking up stones and then putting them towards like the way back that she wanted to watering and then I was helping her with it just like different yard stuff for us.
18:32:28 Get ready.
18:32:32 Mm hmm.
18:32:32 So it sounds like you ended up going, jogging. For three days but on one of the days it kind of ended up being like, not the full two miles.
18:32:44 Okay, well I think the fact that you like started the goal and like even like you basically the two or have you met most of your goal.
18:32:59 So don't be too hard on yourself.
18:33:02 And then the other goal was around, only eating fast food ones How did that go to pretty good.
18:33:13 Yes, today what helped me out with that was that.
18:33:18 I have not eating out after all, because I am again hormones and our mom was for dinner. She's like, Oh, she's like your father and he ate we don't know what you're going to be eating I said, I would have picked up something that you like look to it now
18:33:35 here and I was like, Okay. And so, today was the day I decided to make like I'm going to be eating out. And again chick fil a so I mean, I got the grilled chicken we say,
18:33:47 you know.
18:33:49 Yeah, so you for, like, over this last week you only ate out today, and it was chick fil a.
18:33:58 How did you how did you manage like your meals and stuff do you feel like that was really doable.
18:34:02 Yeah, what helped me also is the fact that um for both of the days that I worked which is Tuesday in today.
18:34:11 They didn't serve as breakfast today but they served as breakfast on.
18:34:17 What was it, Tuesday.
18:34:20 And they like normally just have like different fruits and then like coffee and donuts or like collage cheese I just got like just a bunch of fruit and I just drink water because I don't like coffee functions on coffee I'm just looking at them like, I
18:34:34 don't know, I don't know, hey, props to you, you can tolerate that.
18:34:40 And then they ended up serving as kebab veggies and then like little mashed potatoes day they had, I had like they had like salad with chicken so I had like a chicken salad.
18:34:55 Well, really good stuff so like the fact that your work provides you meals, is a big help.
18:35:02 And then what about the days that you were network that isn't a word.
18:35:07 I just like my mom like we just make sandwiches sandwiches are just so easy.
18:35:13 Very, very low energy and then of course like we by the.
18:35:31 Being healthier like my parents because they're getting older, they want to like still try to eat healthier. Yeah, it's been an in San Francisco I learned to eat butter.
18:35:34 So I've been also pushing them to like eat so much of that eat more of this me seriously so that's also been helping just learning how to make healthier snacks.
18:35:47 No.
18:35:48 Okay, like your family, with them being on their journey and you being on a similar journey is helpful.
18:36:07 Like in terms of healthy eating nice because it used to be really bad like worse like sometimes they do get really bad like I keep snacks and I can keep my snacks for like, you know, 332 weeks to like you know longer, but they don't they take they eat
18:36:26 their snacks in the week. And so, like, these are my snacks, you can't even, like, Yeah, but you don't have to eat them just because they're they're like this name creation gateway in the future like you have time to eat this.
18:36:31 Yeah, that's a good point.
18:36:34 Okay, cool.
18:36:35 Well, um, I think, you know, based on what you shared you have been really successful and meeting my health goals you've set.
18:36:43 So just give, I hope that reaffirms any confidence that you had over this week.
18:36:56 Um, okay. So, at for today's session. What were you thinking of focusing on.
18:37:07 Um,
18:37:07 I guess now would be more about
18:37:12 me like mental health wise considering how it is going to get more stressful.
18:37:18 So I want to do.
18:37:22 I should I should do.
18:37:25 I should get back like painting, probably, I should start an art project again.
18:37:31 Because when I was really stressed back in San Francisco, I would do painting as a way to like release some stress because you know you can handle your, you can let your mind go blank.
18:37:41 So I'll probably work on doing a painting for the winning two little pieces of it.
18:38:02 Thank you froze.
18:38:04 Wait one second. Yeah.
18:38:09 Okay you and froze okay Mm hmm.
18:38:12 So, um, I missed a little bit of what you said but I'll share what I heard, and then you can help me fill in the gaps, but you'd like to complete a painting this week.
18:38:24 And I'll, and that way I can at least like set maybe like an hour.
18:38:30 Apart from my day That way I can work on the little pieces of it.
18:38:34 Just to like brain just not think for a bit and give like you know it's just something relaxing for my brain.
18:38:43 Okay, so let me just type this all.
18:38:54 Ah, ok.
18:38:59 So, in the next week I will work on a painting for an hour each day.
18:39:05 Or you can say I can complete a thing I guess work is fine. Like if you, if you don't get it, complete within seven hours for example like at least you're setting that time away or time aside for yourself.
18:39:19 Um, would it be helpful to make it the same hour each day.
18:39:38 Okay. And do you have all the supplies that you need
18:39:44 a bunch of pain so like I have leftover.
18:39:49 Um, and then I think you mentioned this like as you were introducing your health goal but why is this important to you.
18:40:01 Um, because it helps me slow down, because sometimes when I get really stressed, I start kind of like bulldozing through things.
18:40:11 And it helps to just slow down my brain and remind myself, Oh, we're not all in the future we need to like live right now. And just so back to the presence.
18:40:29 So, um, and I think, while you mentioned also helps relieve some of your stress by being more present. Cool.
18:40:41 Okay, so let's see, in terms of like making a SMART goal. And I think it's pretty specific unless you want to specify like a painting of a flower or a painting of something, but I don't know if we need to be that specific yet.
18:40:59 Do you have an idea of what you'd like to pay. I like to paint landscapes I might do a night scene, like, you know, like around a night scene to sunset and do like a forest.
18:41:17 Cool. That sounds really nice.
18:41:19 This is so random but I've just really watched Gravity Falls you know the Disney. Yeah, and I feel like it's set in Oregon.
18:41:30 And I like envision that.
18:41:33 Okay. Yeah.
18:41:35 Or did my background inspire you saw your background I was just like, that's a very pretty background like
18:41:45 I don't even know where this is that I just felt the image. Okay cool so your idea sounds really nice.
18:42:01 I think one hour is maybe it's like quantifying it. So that's really good and also your end product is one page day.
18:42:06 So you can think of one or those as like the measurable piece.
18:42:12 Is it obtainable yes if you have the supplies and you have the skills, the, the drive.
18:42:22 And then the relevant piece which is the art and smart is like why is it important to us. So you help you said like it helps you slow down, and it prevents like this bulldozing that may happen when you like go go go.
18:42:38 And then it also reminds you to be more present.
18:42:44 Cool.
18:42:44 And then the time.
18:42:46 It's going to be in a week. So, I guess by the end of the week you'll have one painting produced. Yes. Cool.
18:42:56 So, I think I mentioned this last time but one way we can help make sure that this is a good SMART goal is to assess for your confidence level. So what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
18:43:11 9.5.
18:43:12 Okay.
18:43:13 I'll put 10 around
18:43:18 that. I guess for like that 1.5, do you like anticipate any challenges or barriers.
18:43:25 It's really like I'm like in terror like myself away from what I'm doing.
18:43:38 It's like a matter of like reminding myself. Mm hmm.
18:43:37 Like yeah like it a lot of times I'll think about something, and I'll do it and I'll start it but then I forget about it and then I'll do something else.
18:43:44 And then I forget, I forget to finish the other thing and then it's like, wait, I had to focus on this thing.
18:43:52 Um, so, to that point, like, what is something I think was a sticky notes last time.
18:44:01 Um yeah I put it on like my my my mirror.
18:44:05 Yeah. Were you able to get some sticky notes, I was able to get them, I found whiteboard marker sorry yeah I was able to find like one of the markers I have leftovers so I put that inside.
18:44:17 And I wrote, and it helped me like keep track of what I was doing, but also how we keep track more of like, I remind it was able to remind me like, oh, when I had to go run certain errands and get some things from the store.
18:44:32 Maybe so, but using that technique help you in this case to. Yeah, it helped me like it would probably put it there and so that way when I go to the bathroom.
18:44:46 I'm like, oh yeah I supposed to do that and then go back to it. Yeah. Okay, cool. And then also, since this is something that you're doing daily. I can send you a text message like here and there just checking in to see your progress, help you in that
18:44:59 stage of accountability.
18:45:01 Yeah, that was another ironic one, I'm like right after I had finished my run I checked my phone and I had just gotten a takes about 30 minutes of exercise.
18:45:14 I was like, oh what a coincidence could it takes here.
18:45:17 When I whenever I do like three miles. I always, it's like, there it takes me about like 30 minutes. Okay. Um, so that's why I thought it was funny. So yeah, for spooky to
18:45:33 Hello spooky to does this thing really track really
18:45:38 the text messages we do have them. I'm like program to go out at a specific time but everybody gets the same message.
18:45:48 So, it just happens to align really well when you do your activities, and you eat and all that stuff.
18:45:57 Previously we were sending the text messages at like 845 in the morning. And then we have got some feedback say like that's a little too early. And so we shifted the time a little bit so anyways.
18:46:10 Hopefully, it feels like a better time to get the messages and early anyway so yeah you seem very active like very on top of it like No wonder you got into medical school.
18:46:25 Okay, cool. Um, well, I know we are at time and I want to be respectful of your time but I do have a few more minutes if you're interested in sending sorry not sending setting, another SMART goal.
18:46:40 Yeah sure we can send another one.
18:46:42 We don't have to it's definitely minimum is one health goal but if you're feeling like you want to address another thing, or repeat another health goal from last week, like the healthy eating or the running.
18:46:58 Yeah.
18:47:05 Do the running one again to see if I can like get it this week. Okay, sure. Um, so in the next week.
18:47:10 I will run for two miles for and then did we do three days three out of the seven days.
18:47:18 Seven days.
18:47:24 And then the next week we also meet on Thursday instead of Wednesday I believe.
18:47:32 So, do you want to specify the dates. The days I mean, I'm Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
18:47:45 Okay, Cool. And then I think if I'm remembering correctly.
18:47:53 Doing the whiteboard thing on your mirror visible something that helps remind you.
18:47:59 Is there anything else that you want to
18:48:05 like plan for to help you make sure you achieve this goal.
18:48:12 And then that I can think of.
18:48:14 Okay. One thing that's coming up for me, which is something you mentioned earlier, around like feeling tired or like sluggish, which is why you were had some difficulties, running the two miles on the last day.
18:48:30 Do you know, like any ideas of like why you were feeling so sluggish that day and could have been.
18:48:38 Could you do anything to prevent that feeling. The reason why I'm doing it like continuously for those days, is because I'm. Typically I work out in the morning on like the days that I typically don't have work.
18:48:53 That always helps because when I do work.
18:48:56 I live about an hour and a half away from my job and my work starts at either 730 or eight.
18:49:04 So I normally have to wake up like around five.
18:49:09 And I still have different work to do.
18:49:13 So I don't go to bed so you know sometimes we all love and 12.
18:49:16 So just like I don't get like that many hours of sleep I don't need that much I was asleep but I think I do it's just hard for me because I don't want to say I have insomnia.
18:49:26 Like, that's a medical diagnosis, we're ever gonna be like you know non medical terms like I would say maybe I have insomnia just because it's hard for me to go to sleep, and then it's hard for me to stay consistently asleep like I wake up multiple times
18:49:42 in the nights.
18:49:45 I don't know, like, I don't even wake up like with anxiety or anything I just kind of like wake up and I'm aware. And then I'd like I move myself around like I know I'm awake because, like he has to do with that stuff, you know.
18:50:02 Well, I'm.
18:50:03 So two things. One, it sounds like having them be consecutive days will help keep that routine. And like, since you work on Tuesday, what you do before work.
18:50:14 Oh well I don't work over week I don't work until Friday and Saturday.
18:50:20 Okay, so like, I'm basically because you're not going to be like tired or fatigued from work and like it being routine. There's like a greater chance of success.
18:50:32 OK, cool. So I think that's really a good strategy. And we're going to try it out.
18:50:37 And then the second thing is, um, sleep can be really challenging for a lot of people, for a lot of different reasons. There are certain like tips and health behaviors that you can do to improve your sleep.
18:50:53 And so if that's a health goal that you want to look into next week or in the last week we can definitely talk about it.
18:51:00 Everything's a little bit of trial and error but we got to start somewhere.
18:51:04 And like navigate and find out what it is for you that's going to work.
18:51:13 Okay.
18:51:14 Um, so, I don't remember what your confidence level was for your second goal around running last time but has it changed.
18:51:25 So the same line from nine. Nine.
18:51:28 Cool.
18:51:29 So I think you've said really a good health goals. I'm excited to see this painting, so you're mad skills.
18:51:38 And I'll be checking in with you, and text message.
18:51:43 Let me double check our next meeting time.
