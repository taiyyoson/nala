18:08:22 Hello, can you hear me.
18:08:24 Yes, I can hear you.
18:08:27 Oh hi, how are you, I'm doing getting yourself.
18:08:31 Good, good. thanks for joining me on a Friday.
18:08:35 No problem. Thank you for being available.
18:08:37 Yeah, I'm happy we got a chance to connect I'm sure you've been super busy.
18:08:42 Yes, just a little I'm sorry for forgetting about the last meetings, it's, yeah.
18:08:47 Yeah, no, it's totally fun, I can understand being a student, if you're also an employee at some place it complicates the schedule.
18:08:58 but is your time limited today.
18:09:03 I'm.
18:09:05 No, not really. Okay, I'm not going to take up like your whole Friday afternoon or evening, I just want to make sure in case I need to like talk quickly or if maybe I should rush through a couple of points.
18:09:17 But, um, oh, I'll take it as slow as you want it to go if that makes sense. He only the session. Okay Okay, sounds good. Okay.
18:09:36 Kind of like an Asterix there because you're a week behind but we can talk about that later.
18:09:41 Before we get into, like the health coaching part of it I just have a brief introduction, just so that you're well informed about what to expect in our sessions.
18:09:52 So the research project is a two part intervention. One is the text messages which you should be receiving already. And then the second part is the health coaching.
18:10:05 So as your health coach, we will meet about once a week for about 30 minutes to talk about your health goals, and how you go about achieving them.
18:10:19 I'll also check it with you about the text messages and your stress level.
18:10:24 And then after each health coaching session, I do check in with you through text message here in there and just to see if you're needing any support.
18:10:34 If questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope as a health coach.
18:10:39 I'll let you know about the limitations in my knowledge or experience and refer you to the appropriate resource. So one example of this could be like, If you want to focus on your mental health.
18:10:52 I'm not a therapist but you know you can get connected with caps and that can provide that referral to you.
18:11:00 And then just a few more points, sorry, a little lengthy.
18:11:05 While this is a research study and we will be collecting data or a specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be de identified.
18:11:15 So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with.
18:11:20 And then by the end of the project, sorry my voice is going.
18:11:25 By the end of the project we really hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting to help you feel more empowered to manage your health overall.
18:11:37 And also just a big thank you for choosing to participate in our program. Your participation will help us determine whether more us of students would benefit from this program as well as if we can offer it in a large scale setting.
18:11:51 So that's kind of the why and the and the.
18:11:59 Thank you for the thank you comes from so we can see how far we can take this project.
18:12:04 Um.
18:12:05 Any questions before we get started.
18:12:08 Um, no, not yet.
18:12:22 Okay.
18:12:11 So, um, I think, a question that I like to ask. During the first session, just to see like where you're at, is what motivated you to saying yes to this project, like what are you hoping to get out of our health coaching sessions.
18:12:32 I think I'm hoping to like lead a healthier lifestyle.
18:12:36 And it's not just like the physical but also like a spiritual and like balancing all the aspects of what it is to be human.
18:12:47 And I think the text messages have been helping because I think the other day got like one that was like eat all your veggies and I was like, oh yeah so like I grab some veggies so.
18:12:56 So yeah.
18:13:00 So, um, I'll circle back to the text message comment, but real quick. I'm leading a healthy lifestyle can encompass so many things, and it's so hard to like be the most healthy person, like, like Monday, 7am, like, here we go.
18:13:23 behavior change doesn't happen that quickly. And so for this program, we're going to focus on like small achievable goals that you can manage in a week.
18:13:37 And so you can have the same health goal every week.
18:13:42 Or you can change it up every week. So, for you.
18:13:47 out of, like, the list of things that you're like this is what I need to do to make me a health, or have a healthy lifestyle. What would you say is like at the top of the list are the top three things.
18:14:01 I would say it's getting out every day and just taking a walk getting outdoors every day and not staying indoors in the office or at home.
18:14:11 Yeah, I'm trying to think.
18:14:16 Yeah, I think that's like the number one priority. Yeah, that's a big one.
18:14:23 Especially, are you working from home or studying from home, sorry, not working from home anymore No it's okay now working from home anymore. I'm working from the office.
18:14:36 Yeah, were you working these days. I work at a school at a high school.
18:14:42 Oh, yes.
18:14:43 Oh my goodness. so you are a teacher.
18:14:48 I'm a career advisor, um, but I I work closely with the teachers.
18:14:53 I help them out.
18:14:55 What an important role you get to help people decide how they want to, like, what do they want to do with the rest of their lives.
18:15:03 And it's so difficult and sometimes I just pretend I'm like I don't even know what I'm doing sometimes but, yeah,
18:15:13 definitely, definitely one day at a time. That's my motto.
18:15:16 Cool. So what are you studying at USF. I'm in the counseling psychology, the MSC program for the therapy program.
18:15:25 Oh my goodness. Congratulations. Thank you. How's it going, are your first year, second year. I'm a first year. First Year second semester, I know.
18:15:40 Hello. So, yeah, I'm, I'm in the Masters of Public Health Program.
18:15:47 and this is my second year so graduate in December.
18:15:50 Oh my goodness you're almost there. Almost there. I know you will be here to how long is your program, and it's two years from you. Okay. Yeah, yeah, it goes by fast, and especially during a pandemic.
18:16:09 It's, it's two years from you. Okay. Yeah, yeah, it goes by fast, and especially during a pandemic. Well, I think, of counseling is such a great field to go into and definitely can help you in so many ways not just you but so many people so great, great
18:16:19 job I think you've picked an awesome field, honestly. Yes. Well, thank you, thank you.
18:16:27 Um, so, I guess.
18:16:32 A question that's kind of related and something I'll ask you every week is around your stress level.
18:16:39 On a scale of one to 10 where one is not so stressed and 10 is really stressed. What's been your stress level this last week.
18:16:50 Um, I would say about a six.
18:16:55 Okay, that's that's a lot, like on the higher end of the thing, or the spectrum, the thing.
18:17:04 So, with with stress. One of the reasons that we asked this question is just to check in and if you want to talk about the things that are stressful in your life.
18:17:17 Also health encompasses mental health, and so if you want to talk about setting health goals around stress management, we can definitely do that. So, yeah.
18:17:30 Any, any comments there.
18:17:32 I guess that'd be perfect to set some goals around the stress area.
18:17:39 Okay.
18:17:42 Um, So, before we actually get into like those the goals that you want to set for yourself this week, I'm just going to circle back to the messages and ask like what messages have stood out to you over the last two weeks, and have they motivated you in
18:18:01 any way so I think you shared how one motivated you to eat more vegetables.
18:18:08 Yeah. And I'm looking through them right now there is another.
18:18:12 I think all of them have been really, really great. But one of the first ones that I got was what did you do for for your spirituality. Today, the prayer, meditation and it just kinda or nature walks and it kind of, I received this text message when I
18:18:28 I like, I just woke up on Saturday, and I guess it brought me back to like, what can I do to like decompress over this weekend. So I can return back to the office like a little bit more energized and not even for that only but also I mean, for me nice
18:18:42 Ma.
18:18:45 Yeah.
18:18:47 Were you able to do something for yourself that weekend. Yes, yes I was able to go on a walk that weekend.
18:18:55 And like get out in nature.
18:18:58 Yeah,
18:19:04 glad that you were able to do that for yourself, Dave. Did it help you decompress.
18:19:10 Yes it did it did, it takes me a while like whenever I go on walks it takes me a while to actually be able to like be in the moment because I'm like oh like me to my email and it took my phone.
18:19:21 Yeah, it takes me a while but once I'm, like, in the zone kind of rights. It's really peaceful.
18:19:32 Peace. Just don't so nice, Cool. Okay.
18:19:39 So, um, any other comments about the text messages.
18:19:43 Um, I just think they're great and they helped me send her back to like myself and, Yeah, putting myself first.
18:19:51 Yes.
18:19:54 That's what we're hoping for.
18:19:57 Um, I think, I'm not sure if you can relate to this but at least for me, as a Latina woman like our, our culture so identify are so focused on serving other people, like we forget that we're also important and we have to fill our cup.
18:20:17 In addition to like helping other people fill their cups. So, yeah, yeah I can totally relate to that. yeah on so many levels like familia less.
18:20:35 Okay. So, for your health goals, let's get into those because those are exciting.
18:20:43 Um, we like to use the SMART goal model, have you heard about this before.
18:20:50 Yes, it's, yeah I've heard about it before but yeah.
18:20:56 Yeah, so smart stands for specific, measurable, attainable, and then the arc and he can be. Excuse me, a relevant or relatable.
18:21:10 And then the T is timely. So we manage the tea by just asking that you think about it in the next week. So, for example, in the next week, I will go on a 10 minute bike ride on three days.
18:21:31 Specifically, Monday, Wednesday and Friday. So that's one example of setting a SMART goal.
18:21:37 So for you. You mentioned a couple. One was setting a goal around taking a walk every day and getting outside. And then one another one about stress management which can look so many different ways.
18:21:52 And actually I would argue that the walking, can also be a form of stress management. But, you tell me, what do you what do you want to go this week.
18:22:04 I guess this week. Let me see. I'm going to count the days Monday, Thursday, Friday. This week on Monday thursday friday I'll make it a habit, working out, or getting out for walks.
18:22:17 And I'll start small to 30 minutes.
18:22:21 Okay, so in the next week you will go for a 30 minute walk
18:22:30 on three days.
18:22:34 days, sorry I have to type this out really fast. No problem.
18:22:40 Specifically, Monday. Did you say, Monday Thursday and Friday or Monday Tuesday and Friday.
18:22:46 Monday Thursday and Friday.
18:22:48 Okay. I put tea but I didn't know if that meant, I didn't know that.
18:22:54 Okay.
18:22:55 Um, so let's see, I think. Your goal is specific you have a 30 minute walk. It is measurable, because like once you do it you can kind of just like noted on your calendar that like check, I've done it on Monday Thursday and Friday.
18:23:12 Is it obtainable I think for this goal. Like, do you have those 30 minutes.
18:23:20 Yeah, I have to 30 minutes either during lunch, or after work on those days.
18:23:31 Um, what time is during, or what time is your lunch, and would be like 12 3030 to one.
18:23:41 And then what is after work creative work would be at 430 so maybe like five to 530.
18:23:57 And then, is it relevant, why is this goal important to you.
18:24:03 I think it will help them. I think most of all helped my mental health, just to gain some clarity and also like my body is moving so I get the average physical benefits.
18:24:23 Cool.
18:24:25 So I'm just going to read it back to you and then let me know if I recorded it accurately. So, in the next week you will go for a 30 minute walk on three days, specifically Monday, Thursday, Friday, either during your lunch or after work.
18:24:42 This goal will help you help your mental health, help you get some clarity, and then also just help you move your body.
18:24:53 Yes, correct.
18:24:54 Okay, cool.
18:24:56 So one question that we asked to see how, like, just yeah it's around confidence, the question is around confidence. I'm on a scale of one to 10, what's your level of confidence in meeting your SMART goal.
18:25:15 I think I will have to go what the seven.
18:25:19 Okay.
18:25:21 So, with confidence scale of seven, you're identifying some barriers that you may have. What would you say are those barriers are challenges.
18:25:36 I would say like being hungry after work and just wanting wanting to come home and like have dinner. Not so maybe I can have dinner and then wait a little and then go for a walk.
18:25:50 Yeah, I think that's the only one.
18:25:54 Okay.
18:25:55 Um, so
18:25:58 do.
18:26:01 I'm wondering like are there because you identified Monday Thursday and Friday, or their account again.
18:26:12 For example, it does Monday have a higher probability of you being hungry than a Thursday or Friday, or some other day.
18:26:21 Oh yeah, probably Monday the highest like Fridays here and then Friday, you're like it's Friday but, yeah, yeah.
18:26:29 Okay, so what if we change your health goal to say go for a 30 minute walk on two days, and then plan to do it, Monday Thursday or Friday, like, two of those three days.
18:26:45 Yeah, I think that would work better. Okay. Does that help you feel more confident of your goal.
18:26:52 Yes it does, because I know for sure.
18:26:55 Yeah, you can do for at least two. Okay.
18:27:00 Cool.
18:27:04 Um, what would you say it boosts your confidence level two, if any,
18:27:12 may be staying hydrated all day.
18:27:19 To be able to go workout, sorry, I just meant like.
18:27:23 Yeah. Okay, so, drinking water will help you
18:27:30 meet your goal. Yeah.
18:27:39 So, I'm.
18:27:44 A lot of people have used this opportunity to set a goal around drinking water.
18:27:50 Do you think that's something you're interested in, or maybe not.
18:27:58 Yes. Yeah, that'd be perfect.
18:28:01 Okay.
18:28:02 So, um, again, we have to set like another SMART goal around drinking water.
18:28:09 About how many cups or how do you measure your water intake.
18:28:15 I usually measure it like drinking water bottles that way.
18:28:20 If not I'll use like the refillable cams.
18:28:24 And it's like 25 ounces, I think.
18:28:28 So I usually I usually try to drink at least like think it's like at least 100 ounces of water per day, but I don't always reach it and on the weekends I really slack so.
18:28:40 Okay.
18:28:42 So, with this one. Um, how would you using like the same method like in the next week you will, how would you want me to like fill in the blank.
18:28:56 And the next week I will, I will drink.
18:29:01 100 ounces of water, I can do that, I'm just a matter of tracking it.
18:29:08 Yeah.
18:29:09 Do you feel confident in being able to track it.
18:29:14 That helps me keep track of like the amount of water I drink a day, but I just haven't been using it.
18:29:37 So, for this goal. Do you want it to be. Every day, or do you specifically want to focus on the weekend.
18:29:47 We can put it on the weekends, because I know on the weekdays I kind of, I need it. So yeah, the weekend.
18:29:56 So you will drink. I'll just say at least 100 ounces of water at least 100 ounces of water.
18:30:09 On Saturday and Sunday.
18:30:10 Okay.
18:30:20 And so this would actually mean that your health, this health goal like starts tomorrow and ends on Sunday, so very like short window.
18:30:22 Okay, sounds good. Thank you for telling me. Yeah.
18:30:27 Um, and then the other thing I was going to mention is a folks have used like this app called like plant. Water me or something I don't know, it's like, where you feed your, are you water your plant on an app, but you only water it after you like.
18:30:46 Drink your own water.
18:30:47 I don't know, that's just throwing that out there in case you want to track track it that way, but if you, if you feel Come, come, confident with a notepad and that's fine too.
18:30:58 Okay, I think I found it I, I start crying now because that sounds super interesting. I have to, and I'm trying to keep them alive so that's really.
18:31:16 Yeah. Okay, cool.
18:31:12 So, on a scale of one to 10 What is your confidence level and meeting that SMART goal.
18:31:21 And I think I'll be a 10.
18:31:23 Okay.
18:31:24 Oh my goodness. Sorry, I have a little Google person that.
18:31:30 It competes with times. Okay, cool. So, um, what. so you've set to health goals for the week.
18:31:39 One around walking for 30 minutes and then one around drinking water.
18:31:45 Is there anything that you need to make sure that are to help you meet your health goals.
18:31:55 No, I think I have everything that I need. Okay, you can.
18:32:01 Okay. Is there anything that I can do to help you meet your health goals.
18:32:10 Maybe, maybe like a check in system.
18:32:15 And I know not, maybe not daily. But, or whatever works with your schedule.
18:32:23 Okay.
18:32:24 Yeah, So, I can send one of your health goals is over the weekend.
18:32:39 Would that be okay. Yeah, that'd be perfect. And then for the walking one.
18:32:46 Maybe I can check in with you.
18:32:49 Monday and Thursday.
18:32:51 Oh yes sound works ok ok cool. So, I will do that so Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Thursday.
18:33:02 So that basically is what a health coaching session looks like, how we feel about those, they're caught. Yeah, feeling good about them.
18:33:15 Okay, I did forget a question I'm so sorry.
18:33:19 Why is the drinking water one important to you.
18:33:23 Because I drink less coffee when I drink more water.
18:33:27 Notice, so yeah.
18:33:33 Okay, is drinking drinking coffee like or not drinking coffee important.
18:33:37 Yeah, cuz then I get really jittery and then I'm not able to focus and yeah. So, yes, yes, I come like a mess but yeah okay so less jittery. Miss, more focus.
18:33:58 Awesome.
18:33:58 So let's.
18:33:55 Um, OK, so the two, and today I just like to schedule our next health coaching session. Ok.
18:34:05 And then, since we you missed the first week, I was going to ask, Do you,
18:34:12 Do you want to do like once a week for four weeks, or on the last week, do you want to do to health coaching sessions, because the text messages will end by a certain point, but we can meet the following week if you're okay with that.
18:34:29 Yeah, that works. OK, cool. So let's look at the calendar.
18:34:42 What days are typically, good for you so usually let me see usually Thursdays or Fridays.
18:34:51 Okay.
18:34:59 Like Tuesdays and Wednesdays in between like from like 615 715.
18:35:07 Okay. Yeah, let's, let's go for Thursday to say, Okay, And then you said at 615.
18:35:15 Yeah, that works.
18:35:18 Does that time work for three more Thursdays or do you want to schedule after each coaching session.
18:35:26 That time on Thursday should work. Yeah, I don't have anything else. Okay, so I'll send you an invite for that time. And then I just want to make a quick note that for one of your health goals you would you had said you would do it on Monday, Thursday
18:35:45 or Friday. So just know that I'm not going to be like expecting you to have that goal done unless you go for a walk today.
18:35:54 Okay, without.
18:36:04 Okay, any questions for me.
18:36:01 No, No, no.
18:36:03 Okay, I will send you an email with the goals that you've set, and the number that we, you can text me through that number at anytime.
18:36:14 Okay, that works.
18:36:15 Okay. Well, it was nice to hear from you.
18:36:23 Enjoy your weekend, and I'll see you next Thursday. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Yeah, bye.
