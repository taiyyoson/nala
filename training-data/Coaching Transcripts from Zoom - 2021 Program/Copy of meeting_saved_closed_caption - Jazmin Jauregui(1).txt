17:32:52 You want to say a little more about. You don't have to like, say, but just giving you. If you want me to say more.
17:33:01 Um, yeah, I mean I've just been getting like a lot more breath, and then this morning. I was able to practice yoga so yeah that was nice and then Monday.
17:33:17 I, I went on a walk with my friends for like two hours so that was nice.
17:33:23 Yeah, I was late to end class but it was nice because I like haven't walked for a long time like for that, you know, And then, let's see.
17:33:37 Yeah, I've like been more productive. But it's also because like this week has been really really busy for me.
17:33:44 So I think it's also like my anxiety, like telling you to like do stuff.
17:33:49 So, yeah.
17:33:54 So you're feeling a little bit anxious.
17:33:57 But in a way, it's helping you get through your busy week. Yeah, yeah, but I know like after I'm gonna crash, and then I'm gonna be tired.
17:34:12 So, um, you know.
17:34:17 Do you think that there's anything preventative they can do to manage that crash.
17:34:28 Maybe you're like practice self care doesn't like get too bad.
17:34:33 Like, take time off my laptop or like my screen time.
17:34:41 And then maybe like your face mask or something like take a bath is one of my favorite one for like shopping I know it's really bad but retail therapy.
17:34:53 Yes.
17:34:55 Okay, there's some really good ideas, um, I especially like the take a break from a screen.
17:35:04 I'm sorry, did I freeze.
17:35:11 Hello.
17:35:42 I'm sorry, cut off our know why.
17:35:45 That's okay, internet.
17:35:47 Yeah.
17:35:49 Um, I'm not sure what if you had responded or said something but I was just saying that I really liked the take a break from your screen, and more self care.
17:36:03 Yes.
17:36:03 Yeah.
17:36:04 Okay, well if it's okay with you I'm just going to jump in with a couple of questions and then we can transition to what you want to focus on for the week.
17:36:14 For sure, the first. The first question is around the health messages that you've been receiving and which ones, stood out to you, are you liking any of them.
17:36:27 or are they motivating you in some way.
17:36:35 I like the traffic one overnight.
17:36:38 Especially because like one of the graphics this one. Yeah.
17:36:43 She's like,
17:36:47 cuz what I've been noticing with like social media and like marketing is that they usually put like the skinny blonde woman, you know, and so I I like how
17:37:00 her, her body size and color.
17:37:04 And then I like the one from Tuesday, was nice.
17:37:11 And then your personal tech.
17:37:16 The Monday one. I hope you had a chance to stop and smell the Florida.
17:37:21 Yeah, but they're really, really helpful.
17:37:27 Yeah, we like to sprinkle in a little bit of everything so a little bit around physical activity, a little bit of, Like, spiritual or like mental health emotional health, things like that.
17:37:39 So cool. Yeah.
17:37:43 And also thank you for the compliment because I created the graphics. Yeah.
17:37:50 Did he like camp or something.
17:37:53 Yeah, I did. Yeah, yeah. cool.
17:37:58 Um, so, there's a few more to come. So, let me know which ones you like.
17:38:04 And then another question that I have for you is around like your stress level. So on a scale of one to 10 What was your stress level for the week.
17:38:22 Wait, sorry when did the last me.
17:38:26 Um, that's a good question.
17:38:29 Let's see.
17:38:32 We met last Thursday. So it's been a week.
17:38:37 Yeah, So I would say a 10.
17:38:41 Unfortunately my dog died on Friday morning.
17:38:44 Yeah, so like, it's been a lot for my family and I.
17:38:51 And then I'm also running for Asus representative. So like campaign week has also been a lot so, yeah.
17:39:03 I'm so sorry to hear about your dog.
17:39:07 Okay. She was suffering a lot so like.
17:39:27 It's tough to say but like I'd rather see her go in like bags and suffer like see her suffer. Seeing her suffer was like really traumatizing, to say the least.
17:39:23 Well, May she rest in peace or they rest in peace.
17:39:29 And I know you mentioned also like campaigning. What does. How has that been going and where, when will you know that results.
17:39:41 Um, I will know April 25, I think, Monday, yeah Monday.
17:39:48 And it's been going pretty well I've been getting a lot of support. But definitely, I have to like, I've had to step out of my comfort zone and like talk to a lot of people.
17:39:59 And like that like public speaking just gives me a lot of anxiety, definitely like working on.
17:40:06 But I've noticed that like a lot of people struggle with public speaking like I'm not the only one.
17:40:12 So, yeah, and but it's been going pretty good. Definitely. People have been very supportive and Mike has been reaching out, you know, that's the nice it's been very, very helpful.
17:40:23 Yeah.
17:40:24 Yeah. I think it's.
17:40:35 So, all the nerves are good nerves, for the most part, they don't feel great, but they come from a good place.
17:40:45 Yeah. Oh wait, give me one second. Sorry. Sure.
17:41:13 Okay.
17:41:27 I have like an adrenaline rush but it like helped me in a way.
17:41:32 And I've been, I've been noticing that like
17:41:37 I
17:41:40 I'm like super bubbly and like super smiley when I get super nervous which like is a good thing, you know, Like last year I interviewed for Apple, and I was so nervous because I was integrating with like the seat not the CEO Blake the manager of the store.
17:41:58 store. And I did really good Bobby here that was so nervous.
17:42:02 And like I was super outgoing like super super friendly like laughing a lot, like, you know, in the right situation.
17:42:10 And my guests today I had to present myself in front of all the candidates. And I think it is pretty good like I could have done better but yeah like the good nerves that helped me a lot.
17:42:25 Yeah. Um, and, you know, the nervousness will go away.
17:42:30 After a while, maybe not ever, but like, yeah, it's just about practice, once you get the hang of a little more comfortable
17:42:42 even like actors get stage fright sometimes. Oh, yeah.
17:42:49 Cool.
17:42:52 Um, so going back to like your health goals that you had set. Last week, around practicing yoga, and polities I think it was.
17:43:03 How did you do in meeting your health goals on a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did.
17:43:09 Um, I think I got, I think they can be, because I did yoga twice.
17:43:17 And I did my poor walk which I've never done before.
17:43:21 And I brought a friend with me because, well, I can go alone but my parents would take a. Don't go alone because they felt like the neighborhood, you know.
17:43:32 But yeah, I gave myself, because
17:43:38 I feel like I could have more, you know, but I still like this.
17:43:49 Um, and then. So, remind me did we end up setting the yoga goal for four days and then No.
17:43:56 Oh yeah, sorry.
17:43:58 Oh, it was three days, movie theaters four and then between the 230. Okay, cool. Yeah.
17:44:06 So that's a little more manageable like that was a good adjustment that we made before.
17:44:10 Yeah. Awesome.
17:44:12 So yeah, I didn't get to work out though, so I'm sorry about that. But, um, I think, you know, taking a walk for two hours is not an easy thing. And if you want to consider that the workout we could but if you want to consider it that's also, you know,
17:44:33 we can do that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
17:44:38 Um, so for this week. What are you wanting to focus on we can, you can do the same goals as before, or you can come up with new goals if something feels more relevant.
17:44:52 Now, I want to try like meditation.
17:45:00 Go let's say meditation to time.
17:45:06 And then yoga. What.
17:45:12 So, how long do you want to meditate for
17:45:18 maybe like 10 minutes in the morning and then 10 minutes at night.
17:45:32 Then you said for two days.
17:45:35 Yeah.
17:45:40 Um, do you want to specify which days.

17:46:49 Yes, or 16.
17:46:53 Yeah, 10 419. Okay, cool.
17:46:57 And then, in terms of, like, needing resources, do you have like a meditation app. Do you want me to send you like 10 Minute.
17:47:10 Meditation videos off of YouTube.
17:47:13 What kind of things do you need to do this.
17:47:17 Um, I actually do look them up on YouTube, sometimes. In the past, I've like adjusted to what I mean. So like for example I put like morning meditation for like stress or anxiety relief.
17:47:33 Or like, other times I just put like morning meditation for like positivity.
17:47:42 So yeah, I have a couple in my playlist. But thank you.
17:47:43 Yeah. and then I also use headspace as well.
17:47:48 Cool.
17:47:49 Yeah, I think a lot of people use headspace I have a good, good experience with that.
17:47:58 Um, and so, you mentioned, like wanting to do this specifically in the morning and then at night, what would be a good time to do this in the morning.
17:48:11 Well I tomorrow, I have to go to mom to work at like eight.
17:48:18 So I probably do at like 715 in the morning.
17:48:26 And then what about the evening time.
17:48:31 Maybe like before you go to bed. Like, and.
17:48:38 Yeah.
17:48:39 and then what about Monday.
17:48:42 Is it is it helpful to like the set up a time. Yeah.
17:48:47 My dad like.
17:48:50 I mean I don't really know but like maybe 830 usually wake up.
17:48:56 And then it's your bedtime usually like around 10 to
17:49:04 actually.

17:49:12 Do you want to do that for Friday and Monday or just Monday.
17:49:18 Yeah, but please just.
17:49:22 Okay. And then, um, so, um, I'm not sure if you remember, but we're setting up these goals, using like the SMART goal method which is the specific, measurable, attainable relevant and timely.
17:49:42 So I think right now we have everything, besides the are so you wrote in the next week you will meditate for 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes at night for two days of the week specifically Friday and Monday.
17:49:58 So, what the Are we just want to know like why is this goal important to you.
17:50:06 Then meditation,
17:50:09 because I've been noticing that meditation has been helping a lot of like my depression, and my mental health issues.
17:50:16 And it just makes me feel a lot more connected to myself.
17:50:21 Yeah.
17:50:27 So, there's a lot of good that can come from meditating, to two times a day on those two days.
17:50:38 Oh.
17:50:40 Alrighty.
17:50:40 Um, do you feel like you have everything you need to meet this SMART goal.
17:50:48 Yes, I do.
17:50:49 Okay.

17:51:03 And then.
17:51:06 Yeah. Awesome.
17:51:07 That's a good one.
17:51:08 And then you wanted to set up another one around yoga.
