17:14:42 Hey, how are you.
17:14:44 Good how are you.
17:14:50 Good.
17:14:47 Relaxing now, their words.
17:14:50 Yeah. Did he go into the office, know I was at my house today.
17:14:58 Okay, cool.
17:15:06 Um, how did how did it go, how did you go.
17:15:06 Where did I what. How did your last week go.
17:15:10 Um, I wasn't as successful as I wish I was because like I said I was on site, most of the time.
17:15:20 So, I'm work I work with youth, so like if I want to drink water or want to eat something like I have to walk away from them. And I'm like, yeah, I'm not good enough.
17:15:32 Um.
17:15:34 When did we we met on Monday.
17:15:37 Last Monday. Last Monday yeah so, Um, I guess like I was in prepared to make the change.
17:15:47 I'm today's, I had to thought the only two, I feel like I have to start early in the morning like I had to start on Monday, early in the morning, because then I felt like I was off track, if that makes sense.
17:16:00 Hmm, okay. So today I'm on my fourth bottle of water, and I had two tortillas, and I had rice, broccoli, cucumber, and shrimp.
17:16:14 Okay.
17:16:16 So you had three goals last week.
17:16:21 The first goal was around finding five recipes that you can use to for basically kind of like, as a preparatory thing. Yeah.
17:16:33 Were you able to find five recipes. Yes, I have five.
17:16:37 Okay, so you've met your goal there. Yeah, I did it right after we went over.
17:16:44 Oh, so that was done pretty early on. Yeah.
17:16:49 Okay, but hey, that's pretty good. I'm getting it done, is part of or is all you have to do. Yeah, and then your second goal was around, drinking water.
17:17:02 It was, if I remember correctly, it was five bottles of water for four days.
17:17:09 Yes.
17:17:11 And so, how many, how many days were you able to drink five bottles of water and let me check.
17:17:32 Force six only had 248 I only log 149 I had three.
17:17:43 And then I guess it unlocked the rest and then for 12 to today, so I haven't I'm on my haven't looked the other one,
17:17:53 Three I'm Senior me. Yeah.
17:17:58 So I haven't had five s since the last night.
17:18:04 So, 04 days. Yes, okay. That's okay. Um,
17:18:16 you know, I think, going back to.
17:18:20 Was it realistic, or was it relevant maybe we need to like hit that point, a little more because you did talk about the challenges you're going to face and so, yeah.
17:18:44 Um, yeah, something to be more mindful of moving forward.
17:18:37 And then for the Thea, it was going to be 130 a day for seven days, but then today you ended up having to tortillas. Yes. Okay, so then six out of seven.
17:18:52 Sounds like I don't know percentage wise, but let's name it as like 85% or 90%.
17:18:59 So you've completed, I'll say like most of your goal except for the one. Mm hmm.
17:19:07 So, from your perspective on a scale of one to 10.
17:19:11 How did you do in meeting your goals.
17:19:19 I would say like six or seven.
17:19:26 Okay.
17:19:26 So you know it's capable, you're capable of doing it as just maybe not making it so challenging, in the sense of like, you can't take, you can't drink water out what
17:19:43 Um.
17:19:46 So one question, um, that's kind of related is like the stress question.
17:19:53 Over the last week, how was your level of stress from a scale of one to 10.
17:20:00 Last week, I would say,
17:20:05 like an eight.
17:20:09 Hmm.
17:20:11 Yeah.
17:20:14 Yeah.
17:20:14 That's, that's a pretty high stress level, do you think that also impacted you.
17:20:19 And being successful with some of your health goals.
17:20:24 Yes, we won my partner that when I work with, she found a new job so her last it was Friday.
17:20:32 I started a new class.
17:20:36 I'm, and I'm very shy.
17:20:38 And I'm very shy. And I do do talk in class but it's like mandatory and I hate it was another one.
17:20:45 And I had to decide which internship I was going to take, and then sending that email of like I'm no longer interested, it was like oh my god couldn't even sleep.
17:21:00 Wow, so a lot of things happen like a lot of big things happen all in one week. Yeah.
17:21:07 But I went to. I think you saw, I think it was you who saw the picture, I went hiking yesterday.
17:21:14 And then they send that email to a traineeship yesterday. Last night, so that I was, I was like I just clear my mind and here I come back home. still thinking of what the training should.
17:21:25 Yeah. So you like means almost an activity to help distract you. Also, you know, just to offer some validation like you can't do everything in. That's normal.
17:21:42 That's okay. Um, and they're going to be understanding of that like, yeah, you have to say no. So, I hope you know to alleviate some of your stress.
17:21:53 Yes, okay. Yeah.
17:21:55 I'm also, I noticed that you have been really responsive to the text messages like with the emojis here and there. I have been getting them and I didn't get your photo too so thank you for sending them over.
17:22:12 And so you've gotten like new messages all week since we met last Monday, have any of them stood out to you like what are you liking maybe not liking.
17:22:26 And I do like the messages, it's just like a reminder of like, just to slow down.
17:22:34 Have you ever been to Hawaii.
17:22:37 Hmm. You know how it time in Hawaii, it just goes so slow in here is like we're always in a rush. I don't know it's just like a reminder of, I think, that you sent one about, um, I don't remember what the text was about.
17:22:55 I mentioned something like relaxing and then that's when I sent you the picture.
17:23:01 Yeah. The, the hiking photo you mean, yeah.
17:23:07 So the messages yeah were created with with hopes of one letting you know that we have to slow down, and then also just like some educational facts to like regarding like health and wellness.
17:23:25 Mm hmm.
17:23:27 Well, how was your hike is pretty good it was our first time there. Um, but I forgot, like that it was near Monterey, so my nephews were wearing shorts, and I was like, oh my god.
17:23:44 We've been to Monterey a few times and it's always super cool like it's not sunny out there.
17:23:49 So he ended up being a little sending out there.
17:23:53 And it was kind of hot, but it was, it was really good. It kind of looks like Hawaii.
17:23:58 So the area that we that we were there that we went to.
17:24:08 Hmm. Yeah, it was nice.
17:24:06 mana is really nice. I actually I'm not sure if I mentioned this before but I live in Santa Cruz. So, Monterey is like the neighborhood.
17:24:20 I only, I only went to Santa Cruz once. Oh, like it.
17:24:25 Isn't it gets really touristy yeah I'm during the summer months because of the boardwalk. Yeah, that's right.
17:24:36 go to another area.
17:24:39 Definitely, yeah, not the main beats there's so many like little.
17:24:43 Besides the main one.
17:24:45 And then there's also a lot of hiking areas to I can send you information if you want.
17:24:53 Yeah, my boyfriend loves hiking and he wanted to go to Lake Tahoe, but he's, he loves to hike, like if you could hike everyday he would go hiking, and it's like 16 miles and I said, there's no way I'm doing 1616 miles, I was like, no, yes wakes up late,
17:25:11 so for me I don't hike past 10am like you have to be there. You have to be up at five in the morning ready to hike be done by 10. Um, but yeah so our next hike is your somebody I've never been there.
17:25:25 So, next month.
17:25:27 Yeah, actually just went there last month it's really nice.
17:25:32 You too high.
17:25:34 Yeah we hiked the three, so there's like different level of trails. There's like, easy, medium and hard, and then we did all three easy hikes.
17:25:45 And that one day.
17:25:47 We didn't get to do any of the medium or the hard hikes because it was snowing.
17:25:54 And, um, yeah I think a lot of those level of heights were closed. Hmm.
17:26:01 So, that's okay we ended up buying the past, so hopefully we can go back another day.
17:26:07 Yeah. Was there a lot of people know we're going we're going next month, but I think they're going to start like requesting reservations.
17:26:19 So hopefully there's not, not a lot of people there.
17:26:23 Yeah, well if you're staying the night then I think you do need a reservation but I think if you're just visiting you could just drop in.
17:26:32 Okay. Okay.
17:26:33 Um, but yeah, I'll send you a couple places like nearby since you live in the bay right now I live in Sacramento.
17:26:41 Oh, like, I like it so far, like, I don't, my boyfriend drives, and I don't like to sleep, because I feel like we're going to crush or something.
17:26:54 But I always, I feel so tired. And I'm like why is, why do we, why, how come we don't have a beach nearby, like why Sacramento doesn't have a beach near.
17:27:09 So, if there's somebody near you. And then there's another one.
17:27:15 If I remember off the top of my head but I feel like it's Cornwell or corn Cornish Cornish Cornell, I don't know, but I'll try to find it. I'll Google it and send it okay.
17:27:26 Yeah.
17:27:28 There's nice places like near near the Sacramento area to, it just
17:27:36 have to look for them.
17:27:38 I did a hike in Sacramento, or like an hour. Never again, I'm like, No, I will not hiking Mirsad.
17:27:48 Everything was dry.
17:27:50 I was like if I'm going to go hike I'm hiking near the beach and that's it.
17:27:54 Yeah, I think the one that I'm thinking of like sending you to your like, It's a short little two mile hike.
17:28:04 But let me see if I can think of the.
17:28:09 Yeah.
17:28:15 Well those Stanislaus National Forest, but
17:28:24 never been there.
17:28:27 Yeah, I'll try. I'll look more closely, a little later. Okay.
17:28:36 Um, let's see, uh, so I'm transitioning a little bit towards your health goals for the week.
17:28:42 Were you wanting to do something around the same like the tortillas and the water or did you want to try something else.
17:28:56 I want to try
17:29:00 like working now, I haven't. Remember I told you started running my sister went to Mexico, so I don't have nobody to go with. And I'm kind of scared to go to the park but she comes back tomorrow.
17:29:13 So I don't know something about like jumping jacks or 50 jumping jacks the day or something.
17:29:39 What, what kind of direction do you want to go and I'll say 20 minutes of a workout.
17:29:49 Okay. and the next week.
17:29:50 Yes.
17:29:51 He will work out.
17:29:56 20 minutes, and then
17:30:08 a day, every day, or do you want to do three times as I know three times a day, like,
17:30:11 five days out of the week or what I say, five days out of the week,
17:30:22 or the seven days, and then do you want to specify which days, do you want to work out.
17:30:29 Monday to Friday.
17:30:32 So, no weekends. No. Okay. And then, is there a time that works best for you to work out like before going to work or after coming home, when's. When's a good time.
17:30:49 Usually, I would say like 8pm.
17:30:54 Okay, I'm done with class at that time whenever I do a class.
17:30:58 Okay.
17:30:59 And then you kind of use the word like workout very loosely, I'm sorry that sounded really judgmental.
17:31:09 I just might like workout can mean a lot of things. Yeah.
17:31:14 So, do you want to do like a 20 minute YouTube video or do you have your own routine.
17:31:20 I have an app.
17:31:22 It's called female fitness.
17:31:26 And it tells it gives me different workouts so I'm pulling it up.
17:31:35 So it tells me and what I want to work on. So I usually do like a full body, and it's about 20 minutes.
17:31:43 Okay.
17:31:44 So you'll use the app female.
17:31:54 Okay.
17:31:57 So, I'm going to throw kind of a scenario out there.
17:32:01 Um, and it's coming from personal experience. So, you know, you set this goal. I'm going to work out for 20 minutes at 8pm, because it's after school it's after work or just like this is a time that I'm available to work out.
17:32:18 8pm comes around, and you're like, boy, I've just had a really long day. I just want to watch TV or, I just want to not move.
17:32:30 Yeah, dude. Do you feel like that's something that you may experience.
17:32:37 Um, I think only Thursday's because my classes over I ate.
17:32:45 I don't watch TV or anything. So really have no excuse not to do it.
17:32:52 I just have to push myself maybe drink like I've noticed if I drink my protein before, then I have more energy, instead of instead of not if I don't drink protein or anything like that I there's no way I'm going to work out for 20 minutes.
17:33:13 So drinking protein.
17:33:17 before workout will help you.
17:33:20 Okay, so, um, is I guess I'm curious like would making your protein powder or making your protein, your drink at like 730 or like at 745 like what What time should you start preparing the drink and then how can it help you meet your 8pm ish time.
17:33:47 Um, so I've also noticed I found wearing like if I'm wearing jeans. There's no way I'm working out. So, I am going to switch to my workout clothes is that six.
17:34:00 During my protein around that time, or seven. In this I can be ready by eight.
17:34:11 If I'm wearing a different outfit I slept for work go I just don't feel like wasting another outfit.
17:34:24 Okay.
17:34:32 And then, um, so you mentioned like Thursday being kind of a difficult day. Um, it's what you this goal is your goal for the week.
17:34:44 Do you think that Thursday's, you're going to make it through Thursday. Um, I will, I will try my hardest to make it through Thursday, just because I need something to just forget about class, instead of just turning off my computer and then going to
17:34:56 sweep or showering.
17:34:59 Yeah, It's just need something to give me going.
17:35:02 Okay, cool.
17:35:05 So, here's what I have for you and then you let me know how it sounds and how confident you feel.
17:35:16 So in the next week you will work out for 20 minutes for four of the seven days specifically Monday through Friday at 8pm, you're going to use the female fitness app to help you decide the workout.
17:35:30 You're going to drink a protein or get the protein drink before. And you're going to switch to your clothes around 6pm, and all of this will help you decompress from your day.
17:35:43 Yes.
17:35:50 So on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
17:35:53 I would say
17:35:58 eight.
17:36:01 Okay.
17:36:01 I think you said four out of the seven days, isn't it.
17:36:05 I'm not supposed to start today.
17:36:08 So, I've added the seven days, you said before.
17:36:16 Oh, I'm hope I didn't, but totally unless it was started today.
17:36:22 Yeah, Thank you.
17:36:25 Unless you want to do something on the weekend. No, I did say for sorry yeah it was like I think you said for.
17:36:44 Okay, so today at 8pm.
17:36:38 And I'm already. I'm already on my workout clothes. So then the next step would be to prepare for your protein drink. Okay, cool.
17:36:47 Um, so how does. Do you feel like you need any like support from me to help you meet this goal like whether that be resources or something else.
17:37:05 Think I'm okay,
17:37:08 I think I'm okay, cool. And then, um, did you want to set another goal for yourself or do you feel, um, this, This is good.
17:37:19 I think this is good just because I've been trying to work out and I haven't found the energy so I I really need to push myself to do it.
17:37:29 Yeah.
17:37:34 Um,
17:37:33 I think, you know, with people who have set workout goals before they've been they've noticed like an improvement in their overall like a feeling of happiness like working out has increased their happiness so I don't know if that helps motivate you.
17:38:00 Okay, um, let me see if there's no other help people that you have, was there anything else you'd like to talk about or check in about,
17:38:20 Listen, and can't think of anything at the moment, okay.
17:38:25 That's okay.
17:38:27 This is good.
17:38:29 I'm so just remind you, then that we're meeting, I think next week at the same time. Yeah. Does that still work for you. Yeah, that's gonna work for me.
17:38:41 And then I'll check in with you over text message.
17:38:46 Hopefully that helps.
17:38:50 And I'll email you later tonight with a summary of today.
17:38:54 Awesome.
