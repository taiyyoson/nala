09:00:17 Good morning.
09:00:20 Good morning. How are you today.
09:00:28 I'm doing good. Okay, I'm just getting my, my air pods is still kind of connecting okay there, I think this tends to be a delay right sometimes.
09:00:37 Yeah. Yeah, I think so it looks more than where you are. It is, it's one AFN up and what is this.
09:00:48 And just last week it was pretty cold and even at the beginning of the week goes kind of chilly.
09:00:54 Since yesterday I felt that it was warmer. Okay, I guess, yeah, getting here.
09:01:02 I'm hoping that one was a little bit more here because there's a lot of fog today. Yeah.
09:01:08 I mentioned I'll say so it's right, very steady ever been outside yet so I don't know if there's like a breeze of any kind, feels warm.
09:01:23 Well, Today's our last session.
09:01:27 Towards the end of the day, or toward the end of the session. I'll tell you a little bit more about next steps and sort of the the closing of the program itself.
09:01:50 my week was pretty good. It was very busy, like unexpectedly busy I don't let a lot of little things this week, things I'd like signed up to do that I like have realized would take so much time other other little things.
09:02:09 So pretty busy, but I did, I did my two days of walking, because I'm always happy to do those ones I always feel like accomplished when I find time to do them.
09:02:23 And I do enjoy them I love walking.
09:02:27 And then, I, I only did one night of the meditation.
09:02:33 It was nice, but I don't like, like I got very sleepy and I don't like falling asleep with like headphones in and.
09:02:43 So like, like, get myself up again.
09:02:47 And I see cookie
09:02:50 on that scale of one to attempt to measure progress, how did how would you say that you did in meeting your goals for last week.
09:02:59 And each one individually or overall overall
09:03:04 probably seven.
09:03:07 Because he did really well with one the other one you got a good start on.
09:03:14 It's, It's moving. It's like it's moving in the right direction.
09:03:19 And you mentioned that there were a lot of things that you didn't realize we're going to take a lot of time. Did you find that it affected your stress level or how was your stress level this last week
09:03:34 was a little higher maybe like five or six. See, it happens when we tend to have a lot of, lot of things that come up or. Yeah, don't turn out the way that we expected them to.
09:03:52 Were you able to find some time so to process everything else that you needed to do.
09:04:01 Yeah. Yeah, I did. I'm a, you know, as you know I'm a planner so I was like kind of like weaving in and crossing things off as I, as I went along, but I did have to like make that extra effort to get things done on time.
09:04:20 And I think I wouldn't want goal.
09:04:26 Oh, I think it was to reach out to a friend, which I did do. Yeah, I didn't end up having time to call them.
09:04:34 But I did text them so
09:04:40 that's a way to reach out.
09:04:44 Those are my waking up in the mornings like a little congested.
09:04:49 I don't know maybe it's it is a change of temperature and all that.
09:04:54 I started taking Claritin, my allergy was like the warm days were just too much.
09:05:02 So in thinking of today's session, I want us to think a little bit about what are going to be some of the skills that you're going to take, moving forward to help you in continuing to keep the changes that you've made or make additional changes in the
09:05:21 future. But I also want us to think about, like water like what are some things that of course you want to check in about today.
09:05:30 And sort of waters, the focus that you want to have like moving forward. What are some things that you want to focus on today, we can still make a local or several goals, up to you.
09:05:52 So, I think, forward. And what I've most got mad. Be experience is like a painting, kind of coping mechanism to like help with stress, which has been like walking and like being mindful when I am going on those walks and also just setting like small attainable
09:06:14 goals, which gave me like a sense of accomplishment when I do do them.
09:06:21 Some of them forward.
09:06:23 I do want to continue to set like small goals if I think of like lacking in something one week like, oh, like I've been so busy with work or with like studying or school or something like.
09:06:34 Let me make some time to just like. Enjoy.
09:06:39 Enjoy. Coffee with a friend like, and to set that as like a goal of like, I want to do that in this week at some point has like some, like kind of like a stress reliever.
09:06:52 And those are good ways to to like break down like bigger goals that you will have, because, as you mentioned it.
09:07:03 It's not just to you know take a break and catch up with someone because at the end of the day it's going to help you manage stress for example, as you mentioned, so it has an effect on a bigger goal that you have which is stressing
09:07:21 you setting small goals.
09:07:25 What else that you want to check in about today.
09:07:29 What do you want to focus on for this week.
09:07:41 Probably
09:07:44 because like this whole beginning of the semester I felt like I was so Mia, because of like school and nursing and my exam like I barely talked to like my family and I feel like I barely saw my friends I was just like, shut up, shut in and like studying
09:08:00 the whole time.
09:08:01 So I think my like moving forward goal I'm like my focus is just to like, enjoy my time with people, because like at the end of the day, that's like, that's like looking back like that for all remember I won't remember like all the countless hours I was
09:08:18 like sitting studying, you know, I'm gonna remember like the times that I've had the interactions I've had with people.
09:08:26 So I want to focus more on like spending quality time with, like, the people I care about.
09:08:36 And hopefully you'll have a little bit more time now that this semester will be or do you also have summer session to know I'll be completely done, you'll be may 21.
09:08:47 No, I'll be completely done, you'll be done may 21. Yeah,
09:08:51 that's a good summer.
09:08:54 Right, yeah.
09:08:56 It's a good feeling to know that. Okay, now you can breathe. Yeah. Mommy, brings now but you know what it means. There's no thing over your head, big accomplishment.
09:09:08 For sure.
09:09:13 So if we make that I'm trying to think of how to make it specific, measurable, attainable. In that way so that we know okay I'm doing enough I'm completing this goal.
09:09:27 As I intended it to.
09:09:30 So is there a way that you can measure this. For example, you will like you did for this last week you will not text a friend, or you will set up like a time to talk, or, and how much time do you want to spend doing them.
09:09:52 I think.
09:09:56 I think I'm going to change it from being someone that's like far away to like someone that's close by that I can meet like physically.
09:10:05 So I'm going to go with, like, scheduling a time to go have like coffee flash breakfast.
09:10:11 so we can put that for like one hour.
09:10:15 Like one morning, or like mid mid morning like between like 10 and one because those are like good breakfast brunch times.
09:10:27 Too late like meet with a friend
09:10:33 will be one day.
09:10:40 Hopefully as things are sort of dangling down with this semester for everyone else this will also be more feasible for them.
09:10:53 And how confident, do you feel about being able to do that,
09:11:01 and eight.
09:11:05 Any other goals that you set for yourself.
09:11:10 I think I'll maintain my walking.
09:11:16 Note music meditation time. kind of like time with myself more than meditation and thinking about other things I just kind of like think about myself and I can like focus better than when I'm like sitting at a desk writing for some reason I'm able to
09:11:40 like kind of categorize things in my head and then come back and like be able to like write them, get them down.
09:11:40 That's awesome.
09:11:41 Would you say that you want to continue doing because you're doing two days, we're going
09:11:48 to have the same amount of time as before.
09:11:52 Yeah, just about 30 minutes Yeah, when the 30 minutes or an hour.
09:11:57 I don't know why but that it was an hour, I'll double check but I can make sure that it's similar to what you had before.
09:12:05 I think we might have put an hour but I probably air closer to like 45 minutes.
09:12:12 Double check.
09:12:18 Sometimes Sometimes I go for an hour.
09:12:20 It kind of depends.
09:12:24 I would say, whatever you think would be your achievable.
09:12:32 For sure, That way, it doesn't cost you more stress.
09:12:38 Later on, I think they did started an hour, and I was doing an hour, but over the week because that was my first goal I think, but over the weeks I think it turned into like a little bit shorter walk.
09:12:52 30 minutes walk, think you've been doing one hour in the early afternoon so I wanted 5pm today so yes go that time frame. So today's week, it just turned to 30 minutes.
09:13:10 Okay.
09:13:24 And how confident, do you feel about being you
09:13:28 know nine.
09:13:39 Yeah.
09:13:41 Anything else that you wanted to add. I know you've also been working on a few other things
09:13:49 for previous week.
09:13:53 I have really been wanting to try to cook more.
09:13:59 But, like, in my apartment, there we like don't have like the space or all the tools to like do a recipe as I would really want to so that's like one that I'll put on hold for now but once I moved back home which I'm moving back home at the end of May,
09:14:15 and I'm in like my own kitchen. That's like a big kitchen. And like all my mom stuff, like, I think that all try to bring back that cool.
09:14:28 Like weekly meals that I can make like for my family.
09:14:35 So that's, yeah that's like a potential goal that I want to put on hold for now but I definitely want to bring back.
09:14:40 Okay.
09:14:44 Well I think for. I mean with the other two i think it's it's something very good to continue and those are very good goals.
09:14:54 But it's good to think ahead so I know cooking or something that you have brought up before, so definitely keep that in mind I think you definitely have a plan for it.
09:15:05 If once you have the space.
09:15:08 I would absolutely encourage you to think of how can you make a specific goal around it that way can help you to achieve it just like you've done for the walkie, and for everything else.
09:15:26 Yeah.
09:15:29 What I just thought would be helpful, Because I know you use kind of a like system for making the goal like if you could like lay that out so I can look back and be like, Oh right, I need to like spend my time frame and like, yeah, so on.
09:15:47 On the email and I'll send you this week I can ask that because we're using.
09:15:53 We're using the SMART goal method so we always just make it like specific attainable.
09:15:59 But I can send you. Let me see if I can find a little handout of it too. I don't have a handout that I would share but let me see if I can come up with one person.
09:16:16 Yeah, that way can remind you of the different steps that need to be followed. Yeah, I
09:16:23 mean, written No,
09:16:28 my mental notes are not as good anyway.
09:16:32 All right.
09:16:45 Any other successes that you want to share or any other challenges that you are still having that you want to do some problems all the way around.
09:16:47 I think we make successes this week. It wasn't initially like I was initially thinking of like the goal but it ended ended up kind of working out that way.
09:16:59 Because we had talked about, like spirituality previously. And so I had signed up to be a reader for like the commencement math.
09:17:11 And I also like because my mom, like my whole family's like very Catholic I'm like I have family coming up and someone's like, we're gonna watch the mass and it's like, right before the graduation and we're going to look up early and all that so, like,
09:17:23 oh, like, I'll call sign up to be a reader because they had ended up sending sending an email like oh we need readers.
09:17:32 And I'm doing that, and that kind of made me feel good and like a little bit more connected and also like I didn't tell my family, I'm going to read so I think it's going to be a surprise and they like see me on the recording because it's all recorded
09:17:41 and they're going to like, cut it up and put it together.
09:17:46 And so that that ended up working out this week.
09:17:51 That's good. That's awesome.
09:17:52 Yeah, I'm glad that you still started kept thinking about that in the back of your mind and how can you connect that back to like who you are and sort of where you want to be with with that.
09:18:04 Awesome. Yeah, that's great.
09:18:08 So when is your graduation happening.
09:18:11 It is may 21 to the Friday morning.
09:18:17 I'm wondering how they're how they're doing all of those because of.
09:18:24 Like so, a bunch of the, I'm assuming everything is going to be stream at this point. Right, yeah. Everything was virtual. Yeah.
09:18:49 We had sent him a while back, like, like a headshot. The nice one. And then I think a quote, and like how to phonetically say our name, so they'll just do like a slide and like, read our name, even just super anticlimactic but, but that's it like that's
09:18:53 the whole thing like Julie graduated.
09:18:54 And they like they're just going to go through everybody that way and that's about it.
09:19:01 I'm supposed to be participating in the next recognition ceremony. I don't know if that's also for undergrads or for everyone else at USF that might be graduating this to me.
09:19:14 And if I haven't heard of it.
09:19:18 And I feel it in my team.
09:19:22 I heard it was the 17, and I send in information about it.
09:19:28 Yeah, It's like on a Monday May 17.
09:19:32 I sent in focus, they asked for a submission of like a photo or and like a little blurb.
09:19:42 But I'm not sure how it is and I'm supposed to see it you know i mean they didn't say hey, go here to see the live
09:19:51 live show.
09:20:03 I think I saw an email about it but I haven't heard anything recently for the grand Pooh I don't know.
09:20:08 Well I'm excited for that although
09:20:22 I know you're also graduating. Yeah, he's done this August, yeah.
09:20:19 Masters in Public Health, Mike exciting.
09:20:23 So so exciting congratulations to you I didn't know you're also graduating, I don't think I mentioned it huh, yeah, yeah, I'll be done this is my, my second year for the MPH program.
09:20:34 It's very exciting to to be done. and lucky number jobs is just like.
09:20:42 It's okay. We'll get there.
09:20:45 I am my best friend's sister got her master's and
09:20:53 what do what do you what do you call public health, public, I think she's public health.
09:21:05 it. I think it's general enough that I could still work in what I'm currently doing but hopefully have like the opportunity to grow within will will I guess that a different agency at this point because my programs will be ending in June where I currently
09:21:21 work.
09:21:23 So definitely expanding the horizon
09:21:29 for me.
09:21:31 So, any challenges that you're having sorry I get sidetracked.
09:21:36 Okay I did too.
09:21:41 I mean I think I just continue to like battle with like stress like anxiety like with external factors.
09:21:55 But I do think I managed some well.
09:22:02 I'm having like mini crisis like mini crisis with my siblings because they are they're dumb, so so so dumb. So my backstory.
09:22:19 My grandma passed away in November and my mom's an only child and like her mom was like everything. And so she like really fell apart after that and Mother's Day is coming up and she's like, so I'm excited for it like, I don't think think she didn't even
09:22:35 want to be like have a mother's day and she has four children I have two older brothers like 2926, me 22. And then my younger brother who's 11.
09:22:49 I think 11. So, my older brothers, always fail, they always like don't send anything Don't do anything but in the past like my mom was like whatever cuz my older brother lives in Seattle.
09:22:59 And then my second oldest brother's just an idiot.
09:23:03 And so this year. I'm like, trying to be on top of them like I'm texting them constantly, and I'm like, you need to make an effort for mom like she's not excited like she's super sad like not happy like she has four children she should be for gifts on
09:23:17 Mother's Day, like, please. I sent them.
09:23:21 Links to guess, I told them sizes, I sent them, like so many ideas and I'm like, please get her something that arrives on before Mother's Day, like, please.
09:23:33 And they like don't respond to me. They don't answer. They like ghost me, and I'm like respond to me, and they still goes to me.
09:23:43 Like, so all his burden falls on me to be like.
09:23:48 I mean, what is my 11 year old gonna do like he can only do so much. So then it's all on me to like be like, three of my mom's children and I'm only one person, so it's so stressful and I have my brother just fail hair like every Mother's Day and every
09:24:06 birthday. They like maybe send a card.
09:24:08 But half years I don't think they even do.
09:24:14 And I'm still texting them and they're still not answering me.
09:24:21 I feel that's just the way it sounds like it's a burden of like being the responsible child and among all of your siblings right carry this extra responsibility of like keeping them together, keeping them engaged, but also making sure that like your mom
09:24:40 is seeing the benefits of having all these.
09:24:47 Okay.
09:24:49 Sometimes I'm like it's just me and my younger brother and his only two of us. the other two relevant.
09:24:56 There you go. Right. And maybe that's that's what needs to happen.
09:25:02 Do they have like their own families is that why they're just very out of the radar, or they just don't care.
09:25:09 They're so selfish, my older brother has always been incredibly selfish, and just weird, weird like I can't even get into that he's a weirdo that I have like no heart.
09:25:25 And then my second one is like he's just an idiot like he can never show up on time for anything or like, Matthew like can you be here for dinner, that we're gonna like make and have as a family at five shows up at eight o'clock.
09:25:40 Oh wow, I was I took a nap.
09:25:45 Your grown ass man, and you can come to family dinner once a week. You have no girlfriend, no children, nothing. He just parties all the time. He's pretty boy.
09:26:01 I'm like, why are you look like this, his priorities are definitely in a different place, right, so different, different both of them, they're just selfish selfish.
09:26:11 I think that's what it comes down to.
09:26:15 I'm sorry that you have to bear the responsibility of their responsibility.
09:26:22 Okay, it's been this way, I think for a really long time. Yeah.
09:26:28 I mean, and I feel that in the case of your mom.
09:26:32 I think I mean I'm, I'm have a feeling that she has a pretty good understanding of her kids so you've tried the best that you can. But you, what is that saying you can bring the horse to water but you can't make them drink right so you can tell your brothers
09:26:49 to do all these nice things for her but if at the end of the day they, they really don't want to like they don't feel, you know it doesn't grow on their heart, I would say, then they're not gonna want to do is, I know, like, the only option left is like,
09:27:08 if I already got her death. I clearly got her to get the only other option is if I just bought gifts from both of them and like put their names on it, just like last resort.
09:27:25 And my mom would do that for Christmas like whenever when I was in college and of course I didn't have money to buy people things she would buy like random little thing, and then just put from, you know, from Attica.
09:27:37 Mom, I didn't find people anything, it's okay that way they'll think even something. I
09:27:45 brought a cow.
09:27:46 Yeah.
09:27:49 Yeah, That's another option. And
09:27:55 it's in the back of my mind like there's still a little while, so what like two weeks.
09:28:01 Less than two weeks.
09:28:05 Like it means like a week and a half at this point yeah yeah No, you're right, because this week, first already. And then the following days so yeah a little bit over a week, like a week and three.
09:28:19 Yeah, yeah.
09:28:21 I really hope, I'll just be happily surprised.
09:28:26 Yes, by my brothers.
09:28:33 Yes.
09:28:33 I wonder, it also makes me wonder, Is there someone that they actually listened to, because I know you're saying how you messaged them they go see you and ignore you.
09:28:42 Is there someone in the family that they actually listened to.
09:28:49 I mean I complained to my dad that, oh I texted the boys and like they didn't ignore me. And he's like, I'll text them.
09:28:58 Yeah, you need to go listen to him maybe like, I don't know, It's really up in the air with those two.
09:29:10 I think you've thought about all your resources that you can use to, to give them that extra push. So hopefully, they'll get it together this year.
09:29:21 My guest this year like please, please just this year have anything
09:29:39 We think someone is especially Mom, I'm still not ready for that.
09:29:40 I love my mom. Yeah.
09:29:45 Yeah.
09:29:48 See.
09:29:52 Any other thoughts or any other topics that you wanted to discuss today.
09:30:04 I don't know.
09:30:05 I'll miss the sessions. And now it's, it's come to an end, all good things come to men. Sorry.
09:30:13 true, yeah. I mean, I'll still send you a summary of the goals that we discussed today. And I'll include a format that we use for the SMART goal setting.
09:30:26 In terms of next steps, you are still receiving some more text messages I believe until this weekend.
09:30:35 Know, feel free to continue responding to those as you give us your thoughts or comments on any of that.
09:30:43 I don't think I asked him today about about messages, go back up here.
09:30:49 Are there any messages that stood out to you this link, like,
09:30:59 Oh I like, I like the self care Bingo.
09:31:03 Okay, I think that's me.
09:31:05 Though honestly did you like I think I'll go back to that one didn't motivate you to do any of the items on the bingo card.
09:31:18 I think, on that day.
09:31:22 It's like in the top. Take a hot shower bath and I
09:31:29 like purpose because I saw this I was like, I want to take a shower.
09:31:37 Yeah, we try to make it as creative as possible but just as open as possible to so that there's different categories of things that you could do.
09:31:49 Really fun, and
09:31:52 I always love the picture ones, always like bright and pretty.
09:32:01 So the other one that was like, keep clicking together.
09:32:06 A good healthy and family happiness.
09:32:12 And that solid looks really good.
09:32:13 I think I might have eaten a salad after that.
09:32:22 Think towards the end we added a few more like photo base, because we started to realize that many of those who are more attractive visually appealing.
09:32:41 Because when I think a lot of emojis like kind of draw, draw the eye.
09:32:51 Yeah.
09:32:51 Yeah, that's good.
09:32:51 I'm glad that you enjoyed.
09:32:54 And we're definitely getting quite a few feedback on how to improve maybe add more images to some of the messages I think that that's been really good for us to, to hear.
09:33:07 See, so you're going to get a few more text messages.
09:33:11 And feel free to respond to them.
09:33:13 You're also because today's session for you're also going to get a link to a survey, sort of like a follow up survey now that the program has ended.
09:33:23 It should be in your inbox by the end of today.
09:33:26 The survey is very similar to the to what you did at the very beginning. However, I'm hoping that this one will be a little bit faster and it shouldn't take as long as the one before.
09:33:36 At the end, it does have a few like open ended questions to give us some feedback.
09:33:42 Once you complete the survey, you are going to be invited to do sort of like a feedback, meeting with one of my other colleagues from the program. So homie me this time and mainly because just for research protocol they want someone different to do the
09:34:00 the interviews or the.
09:34:03 Yeah, the feedback.
09:34:06 Part of it.
09:34:06 They don't want me to be bias about anything. Right.
09:34:11 You know completely open to say anything and everything that you want.
09:34:17 So they're going to ask you a few questions about your experience ask for your feedback.
09:34:22 How can we improve the program. This meeting might be a little bit longer than 30 minutes so it might be like 40 to 60 minutes.
09:34:31 And we are working on scheduling those around the same time that we generally meet so for example, on Thursdays at 9am will next Thursday at 9am work for you or did you want to look at a different time
09:34:47 should work.
09:34:49 I think Thursday's may six Yes, me, me six.
09:35:03 So, on, on the summary email that I'll send I'll remind you of the date and the time to just kind of put a hold on it.
09:35:12 You are going to receive the invite for the actual interview until you complete the survey, because the interviewer wants to have this survey complete before they before we do any interviews, just so that we don't have to be like going back and forth
09:35:31 with any of that.
09:35:39 So please do complete the survey beforehand. and we'll do, and then you'll get a calendar invite with the soon details for, for the meeting itself.
09:35:46 Any questions about that.
09:35:53 No, no questions about that. I was actually curious like how many people ended up joining we enroll 3333 33 students.
09:36:07 We had sort of a rolling enrollment period so people started at different times so right now. I think we're finishing up a group of six. And then next week we finished another group of six and so they were sort of trickling in and groups.
09:36:23 So everyone is at different weeks of the intervention, but I think will be fully done with everyone by mid. By mid May, so it's exciting.
09:36:35 Now, we got a chance to to meet quite a few students and I was telling someone else have for me it's just been so inspiring because I get to see all of you and all the areas that you do because that email was sent to like over 1000 students at USF and
09:36:53 that includes undergrad and graduate.
09:36:56 So I had an opportunity to talk to students are in law school they're in different master programs that are in the psychology department doing their, you know, dissertation for their PhD,
09:37:20 Wow, and we're all self identify as women and it's just tells you all the wonderful thing that we're doing in the world. And in that. Yeah.
09:37:22 That is so cool. I love that you mentioned that. Yeah.
09:37:26 Yeah, so it's, it was very rewarding. In that sense, for sure.
09:37:32 Mm hmm.
09:37:32 Yeah, and we had it we had a few students from the nursing programs, too. So, it was, it was good to see that and there's also the marriage and family therapy program at USF and think we also had a few from from the program so it's a very wide or of students.
09:37:52 Yeah I tried to get some of my friends who are, who identify and let the man. We're also nursing to do it.
09:38:02 I don't know why they did do some really cool.
09:38:08 Everyone's at different stages in their lives right and it does have that time commitment.
09:38:13 So it's.
09:38:15 Hopefully we can offer this again in the future, and it will be a better time for for others to participate.
09:38:24 Today, all of their graduating this year.
09:38:29 We really do want to thank thank you for participating and excitement. It's been a pleasure to work with you this last four weeks.
09:38:39 And I'm hoping that the positive changes that you made or something that you can keep moving forward.
09:38:45 And remember that you know there's things in our life that we have control over. And it's important to always keep that connection, and mindfulness about our health and our well being.
09:38:57 Because that's going to keep us going and healthy for for a long time.
09:39:03 So I hope that you gain some skills that can help you moving forward.
09:39:08 So that you can continue to achieve any future goals that you set for yourself.
09:39:13 Yeah, no, I definitely think this was really helpful in creating goals and like finding different coping mechanisms and I think I will keep this kind of system going into the future because it, I found it very therapeutic.
09:39:34 And, yeah, and I also want to thank you like. I'm so happy that I was paired with you I don't know how many other coaches there were but I'm really glad that I was paired with you.

09:39:51 so far, so I just want to thank you.
09:40:10 And. But do remember that, you know, taking care of yourself is important because when we take care of ourselves, then we're more able to help others or take care of others too, so that's that's very important.

09:40:41 Taking a break.
09:40:44 Like having nothing to do, sort of, because I'll be studying for my ankle, which is like the nursing boards exam, but I can't, I have to wait for the board of registered nurses to like approve my application to take that test and it takes like two months,
09:40:59 so I couldn't even take the test until like sometime in August. So that gives me like the whole summer, like, study, but also just have a lot of free time and just like enjoy.
09:41:10 San Diego and summer and like my last summer probably I'll probably never have another summer right like don't have to work and don't have other things going on in my life like this is like my last hurrah.
09:41:25 Let me ask you something.
09:41:28 As you thinking about your future career. Is there like a specific study that you want to do your nursing, are you thinking like hospital setting Are you thinking school setting.
09:41:42 I think definitely hospital, I think I want to work on like a medical surgical floor and then after I just kind of solidify a lot of my like skills and like nursing knowledge, like move on to something more high acuity like emergency department or.
09:42:00 I see you, something like that.
09:42:06 As volunteered emergency department in the county one, and yeah, The nurses are just bomb. I love
