17:57:47 Hello.
17:57:50 How are you today.
17:57:52 busy
17:57:55 getting to that time, I remember you mentioned you're in law school do you guys have midterms to or finals or Oh finals yeah finals for, we have literally two weeks of classes left.
17:58:10 Oh, you guys are down before us and our finals are two weeks I don't know if you guys, your guys's are so I have finals. The first and second week of May.
17:58:29 So how was your week how was your. How was your goal. How did it go at a good.
17:58:43 Highly recommend adding blueberries to peanut butter oatmeal is top notch. So good. I bought a big bag of frozen blueberries because that's cheaper.
17:58:47 And it worked out fine I tried it with a couple different things I used dragon fruit one morning and it was fun because it made my oatmeal pink. Um, it wasn't very good like I didn't know dragon fruit really doesn't have that strong flavor you know so
17:59:00 it wasn't really that good an oatmeal. And then I went and bought a bag of frozen blueberries from Target and I'm just really good with blueberries, and I still put my peanut butter in there so it's super tasty.
17:59:13 I've always wonder what the combination of those two would be kiss I know what strawberries, like I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but the strawberry stuff and that seems to go well with blueberries, it is like so good like I'm like I'm hyping
17:59:28 it up but it's really like so delicious with blueberries in it.
17:59:32 I used to really love getting these are say you both like smoothie bowls, and it's like that, because the one that I would get was like the peanut has peanut butter in it as well so it kind of tastes like that but it's it's highly recommend try it.
17:59:49 I will try it actually have a bag of frozen blueberries that I've been trying to figure out what to do with. So I think that's my next thing for this week, you have to put peanut butter in it because it's not as good if you don't put the peanut butter.
18:00:02 Yeah. Every morning when I make oatmeal, I put peanut butter in there, but I usually add like a spoon of like strawberry producers to give it I get different teams, or a little something but I like the idea of putting real fruit in it.
18:00:18 Good I do the, I get this skipping naturals peanut butter with honey, because you know, I don't know why it's so much better but it is so you get there with the natural sweetened with honey.
18:00:33 And then I put a scoop of like the zero calorie natural sweeteners like the trivia.
18:00:41 And then I do the blueberries in it, and it's okay, super good, good, good. Well I'm glad that worked out that would say that I a scale of one to 10 on meeting your goal this week.
18:00:54 Where would you rate yourself.
18:00:56 Oh, right.
18:00:57 Yeah.
18:00:59 Good, good, good. I'm glad that it worked out, that's that's always good to hear. And let's see what else are you hoping to check in about today.
18:01:10 Um, well I did add in a serving of vegetables as well at lunch time. Um, I have been doing just vegetables and then dipping them and just some dressing baby carrots and broccoli.
18:01:28 Some days. So, I've been doing that.
18:01:33 Dinner hasn't been super good. I've been eating a lot of takeout, no I know I need to work on not eating so much takeout all the time, just so convenient.
18:01:48 You know, and it's not like it's the quote unquote good takeout where you can afford like the expensive stuff so it's like, you know, as having a lot of people assassin Sasson i mean but with us her amazing.
18:02:06 They're not good for you every single night.
18:02:08 Good for you every single night. I mean everything in moderation right right moderation moderation.
18:02:16 Yeah, I think the way that you're describing is that yes, it was every night so maybe some days but not every day. Yeah.
18:02:25 They're delicious stuff.
18:02:28 So are you thinking maybe for this week, thinking about a plan that revolves around dinner planning or making different choices for dinner or what are you thank you for your goal for this upcoming week.
18:02:41 So I was thinking about two different things.
18:02:45 Because I know that I just want to like address stress management.
18:02:50 Um, so I didn't know if I wanted to try and do already did something nutritional, maybe do something with stress related, this week.
18:03:01 And I think what whichever you choose will be great. It's totally up to you. And we just want to make sure that it's something that's specific and measurable like we did for the fruit in the mornings.
18:03:12 It was something that you were able to measure and no yes this happened.
18:03:16 So what are you thinking for stress management, what would be a specific activity that you can do that can help.
18:03:26 that was.
18:03:26 I was really nervous about this story I was very confident with the adding fruit to breakfast, that was easy for me, but this one I know is going to be harder for me.
18:03:37 I mean incorporating five minutes of meditation, a day.
18:03:43 I was going to ask What have you done before that has worked, or, or something that you've been interested in trying. Meditation is something I'm interested in trying which is why I kind of was leaning towards that other stuff that I've done for stress
18:03:57 management like just going for walks, I go for a lot of works all the time I also have a dog so that makes it easy, um, When you go on walks Do you usually listen to music or you don't listen to anything cuz you're walking the dog.
18:04:16 I called people, I call my mom.
18:04:22 Usually, if I like it because I'm alone, a lot with this remote stuff and my partner works a lot so I'm alone home alone a lot and so it's like my. It's nice to have company when I'm walking around to not feel so alone so I'll call I'll call my mom and
18:04:39 my grandma my sister call everybody, I'm or I'll listen to podcasts.
18:04:45 Well, the reason why I'm asking is, because there's such thing as walking meditation. I've heard of that. Yeah. And I'm wondering if you could incorporate it to something that you already do, even if it's just for five minutes of your walk.
18:05:00 Hmm. And that way, it's already associated with something that you do and you don't feel that it's an extra thing you have to add to your day. Does that mean, What are your thoughts about idea at all.
18:05:14 And I can find a few maybe like five minute walk and meditations and send us to, you know, but feel free to also look up to see if you find some that you mentioned podcast I wonder there's like a podcast about walking meditation.
18:05:33 I don't know I'd have to look there's one for meditate daily meditation so that was one that I was looking at. I have done, walking meditations a couple times I was subscribing to the Fitbit premium for like a second, and they had a bunch of meditation
18:05:49 stuff I switched over to Apple. They don't have an equivalent for meditation. So, came. Yeah. Some of the things I'm thinking of is, I've been able to find like on YouTube I've been able to find walking meditations that are maybe like 510 minutes I think
18:06:07 actually found an hour one, too. And I think you should be able to play those on your on your device as you're walking on your, your phone or just listen to the audio says you're able to walk, so I'll send you some of the ones that I can find.
18:06:27 But I think it would be helpful to pair it with something that you do and that you enjoy which is your walks, and if you just cut up like five minutes of the time to do that then you can still call you know anyone else that you want to call for that day.
18:06:42 But I think that would work.
18:06:44 It's funny, it's gotten to the point now where for don't call my mom and it is so popular UK.
18:06:53 We get them used to that.
18:06:56 I think that sometimes is, as I call it conditioning, I would go home every weekend. So then mom expected every week.
18:07:09 You know, so sometimes we just get it let them know now you know things come up.
18:07:15 You're okay.
18:07:21 And how many days this week. are you thinking.
18:07:25 We'll just do five I walked in almost every day so we'll do five. Okay.
18:07:31 And do walk at a specific time on a day or. Now it's between usually between classes but it is usually for about half an hour. Okay, so you'll, you have a regular, you have a regular walking my team and I just want to make sure that it's.
18:07:47 And I just want to make sure that it's. If you don't have a time set that you think about when is it that you're going to do it so you already mentioned you do it between classes so that's that's a regular scheduled in between classes or if I have to
18:07:59 live in apartment. When my dog poop so you have to, you have something that reminds you need to do it and have confident, do you feel about being able to do this goal.
18:08:11 Yeah, I feel much more confident now yeah I feel like I could do it very easily on a scale of one to them, like an eight. Yeah. Okay, very good.
18:08:20 Awesome. You mentioned you also thinking about another goal was that around food or was that around something food. I'd like to cut down the takeout intake, so I mean that would be less of a.
18:08:37 What is the word is more of a, it's a negative goals and set the right vocabulary were ones I'm trying to do something extra but this time I'm trying to cut back on something.
18:08:47 It's about cutting back and it's I mean it's just as good as everything else that that we said we just need to make sure that it's specific so for example if right now you're having takedown.
18:08:59 And I'm just using this as an example.
18:09:02 Let's say you're having take out seven days of the week.
18:09:06 How much do you want to decrease that do you want to go down to five days, you want to go down to four, three, probably definitely sitting at a hot like at least four days a week.
18:09:19 So, if we could cut it down to two days a week, and cut it in half.
18:09:24 Yeah, that'd be good.
18:09:31 And this is specifically for dinner. Yes, yeah dinner I'm breakfast and lunch are easy because I'm by myself. I mean, my partner likes takeout. So I end up eating because that's what's around.
18:09:46 So, yeah, sometimes the habits that are a little bit difficult to break our when they're associated with someone else to. So you're gonna have to get them on board.
18:09:57 I know,
18:10:00 like just FYI, they might not easily.
18:10:06 But if they are then that would be a major win. And they will be good for both.
18:10:12 Right.
18:10:14 Okay, so you're thinking, decreasing, do you have a specific specific days in mind.
18:10:25 Like what days I'm a lot like designate for takeout night.
18:10:31 Friday and Saturday.
18:10:32 Okay.
18:10:35 So then, those are the two days that you will do take at only Friday and Saturday and then the rest of the week you'll plan to either make something at home or what would be the backup plan for the other day, via, That's all there is to the takeout or
18:10:50 maybe you will make something. Yeah, you want to start. No.
18:11:03 No, don't do that, no worse comes to worse their cereal right and have something at home, that you can have us as a meal. So yeah.
18:11:09 So decrease take now, and we have taken two days for dinner.
18:11:15 And how confident, do you feel about being able to achieve this goal. That one's harder. Now what am less confident like maybe like a six.
18:11:23 What do you think are some of the barriers that are going to come up and how can we foresee those and start thinking about problem solving, is just busy, because my partner doesn't really like to Kirk, and so I'm the one who ends up cooking which is fine
18:11:42 because he'll clean afterwards, which I'm okay with I don't want to clean. So, but if I'm really busy. And I'm, you know, bogged down with the classwork or whatever, especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I have classes until 530.
18:11:59 And then I can't start my homework until after that and so it's just.
18:12:05 If I don't get around to it then we just take out.
18:12:10 By then it's like, eight, nine o'clock and it's so late but it's just like, Well, God, he.
18:12:19 And what would be something that can help
18:12:26 that's that's that's the that's the million dollar question because it's.
18:12:35 Are they do you have days of the week that are I don't want to say not as busy as I feel every day has something and things come up, but more flexible with the time that you could maybe prepare a few meals ahead of time.
18:12:51 Yeah meal prepping I guess I can meal prep.
18:12:54 You don't and you don't have to do it for the whole week maybe just for those days where you know okay I'm not gonna have time today because I have class until late.
18:13:05 So I want to prepare something ahead, just in case. Yeah, I could do that do like a meal prep or like a slow cooker kind of a meal and then you just put it in the morning and then it's done by the time it's dinnertime.
18:13:18 That's a great idea to think of meals that you can make last, or that if you just add a little bit of something else to the side and become something to new.
18:13:29 My mom is like the queen of doing that, you know like, will make, she'll make pork shoulder and then we'll have daughter thoughts one night and then, you know, and then there's just nothing left to make bizarrely or something or London or whatever and
18:13:45 I'm just like, think of these things, it's I think it's just that. I don't want to say the laundry but it's just knowing how to utilize things right and making the midst of it.
18:13:58 Well, gosh she's so good at that she's like I don't really like eating leftover stuff to make the leftovers and to not leftovers. Yeah.
18:14:08 You make them into something new. I love that. Another idea would be on the next block, when you give her a call, ask her for ideas, you know, I have this, what can I do with it.
18:14:20 And see, I guess my Willa to because she's, she actually was a nutritionist. Ah, there you go.
18:14:26 Perfect.
18:14:39 Yeah.
18:14:33 Cuz you like it.
18:14:35 So how confident, do you feel about being maybe like a seven now. Hey.
18:14:42 Seven above is good for me.
18:15:00 So we have two goals, one around, decreasing takeout and one around meditation, has specific measurements or at least a way to count it two days of the week.
18:15:08 What did you think about the messages this week anything that stood out to you. They were cute I like the little bit graphics, the pictures when they when it came through I thought they were cute.
18:15:24 the only thing that I wish and maybe this would be something for thinking about for the program in the future is it's nice to get the, the, the generalized ones are cool but it'd be, it'd be really cool if they were a little bit more personalized you
18:15:39 know like so like, because my goal was nutrition and fruits and veggies base maybe like only getting fruits and veggie based tips that week.
18:15:48 You know because I like the ones that were about food and then I get the ones with fitness and fitness releasing something that I need to work on and so I wanted more tips that were more cater to what my, what my goal was that week you know or like so
18:16:01 like this week I would really love getting tips regarding lead nutrition stuff and then meditation stuff because that's like what I'm interested in what I'm working towards this week so I don't know something to think about for catering it for next year
18:16:15 when you in when you guys open it up for the student body student body.
18:16:24 I think you bring up a great point.
18:16:27 And I feel there is a way that we can do that, I'm thinking in the survey we have to ask ahead of time. What do they want to focus on like choose a topic, and that way we can just direct messaging related to, you know, for example, nutrition, physical
18:16:46 activity physical activity. Yeah, like you subscribe to certain category, like for the text messages I think that would be really helpful and stuff and then you get to still have one every day for the, for the category that you're in, you know, instead
18:17:01 of getting some that maybe don't necessarily apply to your weekly goal that week.
18:17:07 Hey, I like that idea. Thank you.
18:17:12 Anything else that you want to check in about this week.
18:17:16 No, I really just any successes that you want to share.
18:17:22 No, I think the success was that it ended up, I liked that the habit, started, I just putting like some extra fruit my oatmeal and then it kind of grew into what is on my forehead.
18:17:38 I thought it was a little nod, I saw that it was a Luna
18:17:42 piece of dirt.
18:17:48 I noticed something for my gosh she has no hat on her forehead, you know.
18:17:56 Um, anyway, so I like that it kind of bled into other things like I had the extra fruit in my oatmeal, and then I was just kind of like thinking about okay well how can I make my meals more balanced now and so, you know, for lunch I added in like vegetables
18:18:10 because I only usually have vegetables with dinner so it kind of added in and then now I have like a fruit yogurt, you know, dairy free fruit yogurt first day, you know, that kind of thing so I liked how it's kind of bleeding into more than just a breakfast
18:18:25 habits, kind of bleeding into. Overall, eating habit, more than one meal. Now that's good and I know that's something that you really wanted to start to focus on the the nutrition aspect because although you eat regularly you want it to be able to add
18:18:41 more variety to your meals and include more vegetables and fruits, so I'm glad that it's more present, and that you're getting more ideas on how to do that.
18:18:52 And I'll do my best to support and give ideas wherever I wherever possible.
18:19:00 Okay, you think there's any other questions for you.
18:19:09 All right, don't
18:19:09 go good.
18:19:10 We have very good goals for this week, I'll send you a reminder, just like we did last time.
18:19:17 Do you find the email helpful. Just a little summary of what we discuss, and then I'll, I'll include some of the meditation information that I find. Cool.
18:19:30 Thank you.
18:19:30 Well, thank you, Jasmine Have a great rest of the week you save a life with finals. I'll see you actually we need to schedule the next one because it, we just scheduled today, and I wanted to ask and thinking about finals and everything that you have
18:19:43 coming up. Why would be a good time for us to me.
18:20:03 Fridays are always my best day. You know what your Fridays look like at all.
18:19:54 I'm flexible. And after five Are you thinking Are you thinking in the morning, either.
18:20:05 I prefer morning but I understand that not everyone has the mornings.
18:20:10 I work eight to five so that's typically what we do evenings, I have been taking some mornings off so I could.
18:20:19 How early. Are you thinking, because I could always just really do what can we do nine on a Friday.
18:20:28 Yeah, 100% and then I can just shift, my, my schedule. Let's see.
18:20:36 So, today's is 16 so next Friday will be the 23rd.
18:20:43 Yes, training, nine. Okay, we could do Wednesday again. Wednesday is open.
