11:12:36 Morning.
11:12:40 Are you think you think for answer I just thought, I just saw yours. When I was 11.
11:12:48 I think something's up I should check my email I've been on the computer, most of the morning, but I was working on other things no it's not something.
11:12:58 Okay. Yeah. No worries. Yeah, I blocked off the whole hour from. And I have something until 1215.
11:13:12 Thank you. So how's your day going.
11:13:16 Good, good, good, good. It's a very busy week
11:13:19 and
11:13:22 and, and good boozing good, it's getting busier and busier.
11:13:29 But it just makes sense you know it's the end of the semester.
11:13:32 Has the stress level this week on that scale of one to 10.
11:13:39 Um,
11:13:43 I've been having.
11:13:45 I've been on the caffeinated side, so definitely I do feel, you know, um, but I also do feel that I'm doing my best at managing my day for to be balanced and still address all the things that need to be addressed even though there's usually too many things
11:14:07 on my to do list and I don't get to all of it. So I think less than last week because this week I feel like I'm more.
11:14:18 I'm
11:14:18 more on the go go go go say like, you know, like, not waiting for things to happen and I'm tackling things that need to be, you know, so I'm on top of everything that's what I mean so I think less stressed and last week, but still, I would say six were
11:14:35 10.
11:14:39 Six.
11:14:39 And how did you do with meeting your goals, this last week on a scale of one to 10. Yeah, it was 10 honestly I did not think it would be.
11:14:48 I thought would be more challenging than it was.
11:14:53 So that was really good. That was really good to realize that I wasn't spending that much time.
11:15:02 And also, I've been very mindful of the fact that I need to get my eight hours of sleep to get, you know.
11:15:10 Yeah, no, I don't know I no longer have the those, you know, empty mornings.
11:15:19 Yeah, I don't want to be wasting time so I'm aware of it. Now that we put this goal in that it wasn't as bad as I thought it was.
11:15:28 Good.
11:15:28 I'm glad it didn't keep you too late. Yeah, yeah no i didn't i didn't so it's really good.
11:15:33 So what are some things that you want to check in about today.
11:15:40 Um, I'm meditating every day and that has been very helpful.
11:15:44 I've been trying something different.
11:15:48 I'm getting my 20 minutes, minimum.
11:15:51 But I've been trying, and with a new.
11:15:58 I've been trying with dividing it into two.
11:16:02 And having like this you know mindful moment in the morning and mindful moment in the afternoon.
11:16:09 And I'm experimenting, seeing how it feels.
11:16:15 I have my go tues You know, when I listened to the guided meditation.
11:16:21 One is 20 minutes long and the other ones 30.
11:16:25 So I'm trying, I'm doing those, but on top. I'm adding this five minute one. And there's a 10 minute one as well.
11:16:35 And I think it helps ground me, you know, like if I feel like only going to have so much so many things going on. And then I realized that I'm a little bit over the place.
11:16:45 You know, looking at the time and thinking like, Oh, actually, I do have, you know, 10 minutes to take a break in and do this, I find harder. The smaller meditations, because it takes me a couple minutes to get into that, you know, being.
11:17:08 Um, so the five minutes one it's just me noticing all these thoughts.
11:17:12 But it's, I find it. I find to be productive.
11:17:16 So, so that's that's really that's been fun I don't know why I started doing that but I thought I might as well, you know, Try heartfelt to do a second time.
11:17:28 Oh, that's good.
11:17:29 And I think breaking it down into, like, the chunks that work for you it's it's the best way to do it because then you'll be able to achieve it.
11:17:48 For 20 minutes inside too long of a stretch to 10 minutes. So I need a better time. No, definitely, definitely, and no yeah, honestly, I've been surprised because I I didn't try that before and I've been on a roll with it so I'm actually surprised.
11:18:02 Good. I'm happy about it because it makes a difference. difference.
11:18:08 So for this upcoming week.
11:18:10 Do you want to continue with the meditation and doing the 20 minutes in the morning, afternoon I think you mentioned.
11:18:19 Yeah. Okay. Yeah, definitely.
11:18:22 I think I'm getting
11:18:26 there a good response, you know.
11:18:30 So definitely want to continue with that.
11:18:33 You saved me.
11:18:39 And how many times during this week.
11:18:43 I've been doing it every every day.
11:18:46 So, we want to continue on that.
11:18:50 And you did say that it was morning and afternoon.
11:18:54 Yeah.
11:18:58 When you say every day that's seven days a week.
11:19:03 Five, interesting. Yeah, seven,
11:19:07 and how confident, do you feel about being able to continue with the meditation. On a scale of one to 10.
11:19:15 And this new format, um, I would say nine, because I'm you know trying it out. I've done it in the past week I've done in the past three days, I think, three or four days I'm a little bit.
11:19:29 We're Thursday.
11:19:32 So yeah, this week I started trying that out, and I want to see you know how continues so I'm sure I'm curious to see I think I'm very confident that I can meditate for 20 minutes.
11:19:43 But I'm wondering you know if I can consciously put, you know, create that 10 minutes space.
11:19:53 twice a day I think that'll be really really nice to try that out.
11:19:59 Okay. And is there another goal that you want to focus on for this week or maybe want to just dedicate time to the meditation since there's a lot going on with Anderson.
11:20:09 Yeah, I was just thinking about that like I'm tempted, but the same time I think that I'm getting so many benefits from from doing this.
11:20:22 And I don't feel like it's the right time for me to add something totally new. Yeah.
11:20:28 Yeah, I think you got to get to space it out feel it out and see how it goes.
11:20:35 I would say definitely having at least one goal is a good.
11:20:39 It's a good continuation and a good thing to continue to improve upon.
11:20:44 Yeah, especially because before you were doing meditation, but in a different form and now it's still meditation, but it's breaking it down into two, two slots.
11:20:53 So, I think it's, it's a good, good, good. Thank you. Thank you.
11:20:58 Any other challenges that you had this last week or successes that you want to share.
11:21:07 What's really working out well.
11:21:25 The thing was working out, is that I've been I'm
11:21:20 more present.
11:21:24 And that has allowed me to witness a little bit more. My flows of emotions and in during my day and not
11:21:33 be
11:21:37 overwhelmed is not the term, but you know some some mornings when you wake up and you feel like oh my goodness is days going to be so long and suddenly you let that emotion take over how your day is going.
11:21:49 When it was just you know what it was just an emotion, you know like just a feeling of overwhelm being overwhelmed or fearing are being able to accomplish everything.
11:22:01 So it's really nice to be able to take that necessary distance.
11:22:07 And sometimes it still takes over, you know, but now the entire day.
11:22:12 It takes over but I don't let it, you know.
11:22:19 You know when you're stressed and you're like not really in the moment and you're constantly.
11:22:25 You don't dwell on it for as long Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, so that has been really nice to notice the difference.
11:22:35 I'm so has been a success and its own you know I don't know how to better describe it but i think that's that's that's something I noticed and I, I, you know, I was, I was happy to, to witness.
11:22:48 And then, just being able to as I said at the beginning, but the other sort of the second success, for me, is you know I had this narrative of me, you know, wasting so much time and energy, and actually didn't when I, you know, actually looked at the
11:23:05 time.
11:23:08 It wasn't as dramatic as it as I had it, you know, in my head, like, oh my goodness all this time wasted whatever.
11:23:16 Um, and I think it helps to put a time and it also helped to
11:23:26 pay attention.
11:23:31 Just that awareness. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. sounds good.
11:23:36 I heard like Tell me where you were to figure out how to turn off that. Next, on Netflix.
11:23:43 Oh, you know what, I didn't check it but mainly the reason why is because I was watching this week I told her what I did not know what to watch, and they ended up putting, there's this British
11:23:59 channel I have.
11:24:01 And they have.
11:24:04 And I can record
11:24:08 this TV show, and the TV show is half an hour, and I've been wanting to. So it was, you know, and you have to press all these buttons. Jack's recordings from your TV.
11:24:21 So, there wasn't that you know trigger of like all the next one. Oh, the next one.
11:24:27 But honestly I'm what I'm going to look at right now because I'm just curious to know what the answer is in terms of.
11:24:40 Does this Netflix. What would it be called,
11:24:43 Maybe high return our next feature on Amazon or some.
11:24:52 What am I saying Amazon Netflix. Too many streaming things.
11:24:55 Oh, there you go. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, that was good keywords that you gave me
11:25:10 at one issue and I have a question. I just typed my question as I'm thinking.
11:25:10 Right. Because as you know you're absolutely right and actually you're right yeah there's an on.
11:25:15 It's already checked us out of play next episode in a series on all devices and into. It's part of my profile, and I did not know that. So that's really, that's really important that I go on, you know, next time that I started watching a TV show because
11:25:41 So, so that's really good. In fact, I'm, I'm surprised that I didn't think about it before because on my YouTube channel whatever account.
11:25:51 It was out of play. It was set on a plane I hated that. And I made sure that, you know, that was like it was no longer a thing.
11:26:01 But I'm surprised I never thought about doing it for Netflix I was just like, oh, that's how it goes, you know.
11:26:13 No seriously, no no no it's not and yeah that's what these conversations or four right brainstorm how to maybe it is there we just haven't thought about it.
11:26:26 Exactly. No no totally because honestly it came with the world of Netflix autoplay was not always there on YouTube.
11:26:29 But Netflix always came without a play.
11:26:33 So it wasn't even on my radar that I could be you know changed. And, yeah, you know, it's silly but when you're done, going and saying okay play next week.
11:26:45 It's different than just like, Oh, yeah.
11:26:50 The next one.
11:27:00 And there's so many studies on that, by the way, that's why they do it. They want to keep you there as, as long as possible. Yeah, they want you to be a couch potato.
11:27:07 Yeah.
11:27:05 Bad potato be Oh, Yeah, yeah.
11:27:09 Absolutely, absolutely.
11:27:10 So, so yeah, those are the really positive, you know, changes. That's awesome. I'm glad to hear. Yeah,
11:27:33 Go to the messages for this week. What were some of the messages that stood out to you this week, were there any that sort of push you to the next. Oh yes, the one next, the one to connect with friends.
11:27:43 They're very much resonated, and even if I'm not like I'm talking to you right now so I'm noticing the link. But this week, compared to the past.
11:27:57 At least 18 months I want to tell you this week I actually made content you know like efforts to reach out to friends, and I'm always in touch with my friends.
11:28:10 But, reach out to those that I hadn't been in touch with that I lost touch with, you know, because of the pandemic such a weird.
11:28:17 Everyone's, you know, moving in different places. So I got my phone and I went, you know, back in history. And I was like, Hey, how are you what's going on I want to know you know how you are and all that.
11:28:30 And so, that message of like reaching out and you know, to people and I think the text itself said, Go out and dance you know connect with a friend.
11:28:41 So I had a really positive impact.
11:28:46 Oh, yeah.
11:28:47 Yes, and I realizing now that if it says go like down to the friend.
11:28:55 My be mad a doable thing right now.
11:29:11 Over FaceTime, it's not it's not but the the idea of like, Okay, well, this is our current situation but it was for me was like okay reach out you know you cannot go dance like I highlighted that in my head, like, but I reached out to, to my neighbor,
11:29:15 I reached out to, to a friend of my brother who's also one of my friends that I hadn't talked in a very long time. And, you know, one thing is leading to the other and I'm connecting dots and it's good it's it's healthy, you know I I feel like I have
11:29:35 been the case.
11:29:38 the case. Yeah, yeah.
11:29:40 Isolation is a great. It's a huge public health issue right now.
11:29:45 And we often think of it as, Oh, it affects a certain population. the population we often talk about his older adults.
11:29:52 But right now it's affecting all of us because we're all in isolation do to cope it.
11:29:58 So, staying finding ways to stay in touch, whether it's virtual whether it's tax you know calls it does change how we feel and. Absolutely. The way that we see.
11:30:12 Absolutely. I hundred percent agree. And the thing like the easy thing is to say like, oh, nobody cares right no one has reached out to me. And, oh my goodness it's so easy to get into that train of like, leave me alone, whatever.
11:30:24 And I'm like I'm super Uber positive but it's this year has been challenging. You know, I'm, everyone else.
11:30:33 Yeah.
11:30:34 But so, you know, making the effort and reaching out and checking in, has, You know, it may lead to my next you know project so it's been a really good.
11:30:47 I'm glad that they you connect reconnected. Yeah.
11:30:52 Yeah.
11:30:53 I have this tendency to delete all my text messages just because I like to have a clean inbox. but that actually then I forget.
11:31:03 Oh, I, but my rule is deleted ones that I feel that conversation has come to like a still like there's really nothing else I need to get back to them about, they don't need to get back to me about anything else.
11:31:18 But I like to clean text message and I honestly as I so many times, I'm and.
11:31:32 Because I also like to have like that create like clean. And I think that's why I really like, What's up, because instead of having the choice between.
11:31:38 Keep it or delete it on WhatsApp you can archive it.
11:31:43 And so, you no longer see it, but it's there in your history.
11:31:48 And so, I really liked
11:31:54 it appeases both of my needs you know the need of like having a green screen.
11:32:00 And the other one we like okay, I'm not going to forget the conversation that we had, you know, last year. And that's true so many people that I connected with I checked.
11:32:08 And our last conversation was March of last year,
11:32:14 know that, because now you reconnected.
11:32:18 Exactly, yeah so it's good. It's really good. I'm happy.
11:32:23 Any other topics that you want to check in about today today we made me want to go over the progress you've made so you've made progress with meditation.
11:32:33 And we of course want to address any barriers that you've encountered.
11:32:38 And I think you've done really well at when things over ice you find ways to to problem solve around it.
11:32:46 But if you need if there's something that sort of been lingering that you like I'm not sure how to solve this, let me know. and we can do some brainstorming around it.
11:32:58 But I think you have a very solid action or goal for health goal for this upcoming week. Yeah.
11:33:08 Yeah, absolutely. And you mentioned you have a 20 minute meditation that you already do Did you need additional ideas on any of those, no because I grew up with.
11:33:21 I recently graduated to this one arm.
11:33:24 In these new theater visual at these rallies ation that I really enjoy.
11:33:29 And each time it's a different experience and so you know, I'm good. Okay.
11:33:36 Yeah, I will let you use what you're using because it's working.
11:33:40 So as every week well, I'll send you a summary of the goal that we discussed for today.
11:33:48 Today is our session three.
11:33:56 There will be one more session next Thursday. And then at the next session, I'll let you know sort of what are the next steps for, and what happens after session for, you're still getting messages and you should continue to get text messages for the four
11:34:10 weeks of the program. I'm trying to remember if your messages. And I think you might still have some more messages. Until we meet next week so we should still be able to check in about a few more
