20:31:29 Sorry I didn't realize you came on. Hey, no worries, took a little bit of time to get connected to audio so I totally thought it was that, that's okay.
20:31:40 Hang on, sorry let me turn off that light and turn on the other like give me just a second.
20:31:44 Sure.
20:32:26 Oh better Yeah.
20:32:30 Well thank you so much for meeting with me today and also for your flexibility about the change in our meeting time. Did your previous meeting go okay.
20:32:54 Yeah, thank you. It did.
20:32:46 Okay, cool.
20:32:47 Um, so just a little bit about myself. My name is Jasmine and I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks.
20:32:55 I'll be giving you a quick little introduction and then we can transition into like setting your health goals, so that's I'm okay. Yeah, sounds great.
20:33:05 Okay, cool. So, the first thing, examine the intervention that we're that you're a part of has two aspects to it. One is the daily text messages, which you should have started receiving last Friday.
20:33:17 I did, yeah. Okay, cool. And then the second aspect is the health coaching. So, I'm in my role as your health coach I'll meet with you about once a week for about 20 minutes to 30 minutes or so, I do have some flexibility to me after that if are beyond
20:33:34 those times if needed.
20:33:49 But during that time I'll check in with you about the messages about your health goal, and then about your stress level. Okay.
20:33:49 With an email about our session, and then in between our sessions I'll send you a couple of text messages just to check in to see how you're doing. And if you're needing any additional support at that point.
20:34:01 Cool.
20:34:04 If any questions or topics come up that are outside of my area of expertise.
20:34:19 I'll definitely let you know about the limitations and my knowledge and get you connected to the appropriate resource. Okay. Um, so the other thing is, this is a research study and we will be collecting data, but our specific conversation will be kept
20:34:29 confidential and the data will be de identified.
20:34:33 So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with.
20:34:38 And so, by. Sorry, just a little more.
20:34:42 But by the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual mental and physical health.
20:34:54 So with that, I just want to thank you again for choosing to participate in the program, until like know a little more about where we're going to go with this.
20:35:04 Since this is just a brief intervention. We're trying to see if one students are interested in a program like this, and to if we can offer it to more students at like a larger scale, not just like Latino students.
20:35:19 So, that's what your participation is helping us do.
20:35:23 Yeah. Any questions before we get started, I don't think so.
20:35:28 Okay.
20:35:34 So, With typically with these sessions, I'll just come and check in with you about like where you're at and what you'd like your health goals to or what you how you did with your health goals but since this is our first session.
20:35:47 I just like to start by asking, What motivated you to participate in our program like.
20:35:56 Yeah. How does that link up to you to some game my Masters in Public Health.
20:36:00 So, I'm in the School of Nursing and public health or health professions.
20:36:07 And one of my professors is the one who actually sent the opportunity over like to my email so I recognized her name, and I'm kind of at this point in my life where I'm just kind of deciding to start making some helpful behavior changes.
20:36:26 So, I know that life is kind of starting to go back to normal after Cove it I'm like, I want to be healthier I want to feel better.
20:36:36 I know that there's a lot of things in my life where I know, logically what will make me feel better and healthier, but I'm not doing it and so just kind of trying to bridge that gap from, you know, eating more fruits and vegetables to like going for
20:37:04 a walk in the morning to drink less coffee to, you know, not working in my bed and working at my desk instead like all of those things you know I like, I know it, like I'm studying health, you know, but if I'm not doing it.
20:37:08 So I think that that's kind of the biggest thing is just like some level of accountability, so that I can actually like start taking the steps towards making the changes, rather than just kind of thinking about them.
20:37:23 Yeah, it's interesting that you like, say, like you said so much that falls in line with what we do.
20:37:31 We did this program at the beginning of the semester and so some participants, like they refer to me as their accountability buddy so I think you're like, right, like on target.
20:37:42 Also, I'm an MPH student to Oh awesome.
20:37:46 Yeah. Are you first year, second year, and the first year.
20:37:50 Oh cool. So are you doing the community, or the Okay, cool. Um, Yeah, so did you have Dr Lingle yeah I have her.
20:38:01 I have a right now for health communications.
20:38:06 Yes, and this is the class that you're going to talk about, well, I'm sure you've already talked about like the stages of change and whatnot. So, one thing I like kind of heard you say, and so many words is like bridging like a gap between like the knowledge
20:38:22 and the doing, which is definitely part of that. So, it's very cool. I'm happy that we got connected and like, you know, I want kind of similar things to, like, perhaps you can be in my position next year.
20:38:37 If the program gets replicated. Yeah, that'd be awesome what classes this word.
20:38:43 Um, so you know we have to do an internship. Yeah.
20:38:47 So, I'm health coaching as part of my internship. Oh, awesome. Okay, cool. Yeah, so if it falls.
20:38:55 I'm not exactly sure, because I'm doing the behavioral health concentration so I'm not sure how, like similar our curriculum is, but there's a.
20:39:06 Do you have to do like the health education course.
20:39:10 You know, possibly, I don't know I haven't looked that far ahead. Yeah, you don't have to worry about it it's all pretty seamless. But, um, that's what we did and so falls really in line with a lot of the stuff that we've learned.
20:39:23 Okay.
20:39:23 Yeah, so a lot of motivational interviewing. So, all that good stuff.
20:39:29 Feel free to ask me any questions also about like mph stuff.
20:39:43 I'm only like a year ahead of you which is not that much but the programs are. It can count for much. Yeah.
20:39:47 Um, okay, cool. So, in your, in all those things you did mention, like a lot of health goals and any of those things. We can check in about and make your health goal for the week.
20:39:59 And so typically with clients or participants sorry.
20:40:05 We like to set goals for the week, and have maybe one to two max three, just to make sure that you are successful in meeting your health goals. So, I know you mentioned,
20:40:21 like eating more fruits and vegetables, if that's where you want to go then we can set a goal around that. If you want to increase physical activity, we can go that way.
20:40:30 If you want to focus on your mental health like do some meditation, like that could be your health goal for the week so, um, anything like sparking interest.
20:40:40 Yeah, I think fruits and vegetables is a big one, I think I I just started living by myself and so I work pretty long days and pretty long weeks and then by the end of the day, I'm like, I could make dinner like I could you know like cook some vegetables
20:40:58 and some me and some, like I make something, or I could just like order Uber Eats, you know, or make box mac and cheese you know and so I think that that's another one of those like between the intention and the action there's like a disconnect that I've
20:41:12 got like all this produce in my kitchen that just goes bad by the time I think about getting around to using it.
20:41:20 And so I think like, maybe not even fruits and vegetables maybe just like preparing one meal a day or something like that, like, just trying to limit like I'll look at my day and I'll be like, Why do I feel like shit and I'll be like oh wait McDonald's
20:41:49 breakfast and leftover pizza for lunch, you know, like, and neither of those things are good for me. And so, saying like, oh I made you know, a scramble with like vegetables and eggs and stuff like, I know that would make me feel better. It's just like between buying the groceries and then cooking the food and then eating the food, you know.
20:41:56 then cooking the food and then eating the food, you know. Yeah, I'm as I'm hearing on a lot of things and when yeah I'm sorry highlight, no no this is good, this is good, this is like it's like
20:42:08 kind of a refined, what drives us. Yeah. And so what I'm hearing about what drives you is that you want to feel better. Like that's, that's one of your primary motivations for cooking one meal a day.
20:42:24 So it's not necessarily like your access to fruits and vegetables but it's bringing in like that home cooked mess so that you eat less processed foods.
20:42:40 Yeah, which we can categorize like things that you buy on Uber Eats mac and cheese. Yeah. Yeah. And, yeah, honestly, it's like, as a college student, and a full time worker like I totally understand.
20:42:51 I'm needing those. Oh, I'm so sorry one second.
20:43:00 Sorry, my, my office is my bedroom and I share the bedroom so I had to like personnel.
20:43:09 So I definitely understand the importance of
20:43:14 getting getting that one meal a day. Yeah. Home good.
20:43:20 I feel like a reasonable goal to like I don't need it to be every meal like work gives us free Uber Eats money. And so it's hard to like financially to be like, Oh, I could order, Starbucks for mornings a week or I could like make coffee at home, you
20:43:37 know, or drink water.
20:43:40 So yeah, I think, I think one meal a day is like, I can handle that like that's realistic you know it's not like something that is so hard I'm just gonna fail.
20:43:51 Yeah. And with with this program to we make it really flexible so if you're like, I'm gonna make one meal a day for four days out of this week. like, we want to make sure it's achievable.
20:44:05 Um, so I guess another kind of important thing to know is smart goals, I usually I use the SMART goal format to craft your goals so making them specific, measurable, attainable relevant and timely and the time piece we usually keep two one week.
20:44:26 Okay, so.
20:44:30 Also, I wanted to introduce another thing that I think might help cut.
20:44:36 Put, I guess like connect the dots like it did for me hopefully yeah hopefully it does the same for you, but like, typically, I would go to the grocery store and just buy like healthy foods.
20:44:47 I'm like, Okay, I'm going to buy this this this and this and I'm going to put it in my fridge and I want to make healthy food with it ultimately that ended up, resulting in a lot of food getting through now, because I didn't like.
20:45:00 I didn't plan for what I was going to cook.
20:45:04 And so some again this is like the aha moment for me was like someone told me will instead of shopping, and then planning what to eat plan what to eat and shop for those items so then I don't end up over buying and overspending and having a lot of food
20:45:30 waste, so I don't know if that helps.
20:45:31 For you, but yeah, now I think it does. I think it's just like, I can have good intentions like I do Hello Fresh once in a while like maybe once a month, like, just to get things that are otherwise wouldn't buy or wouldn't make.
20:45:46 And I'll be picking my meals and I'll be like, Oh, this and this sounds good and then they'll get here and I'm like I don't want to eat that. And so I think that that's the harder pieces like.
20:45:57 Today I'm craving like a turkey hotdog and mac and cheese like and so if I had plans to make like whatever.
20:46:06 I don't know salad bread. Exactly. And then my well that's out the window because like, now I'm going to eat what I want to eat, you know, and then I did buy some healthy things the other day like I bought some, like pre made deli salads and stuff I was
20:46:21 like am I motivate myself to like set of order an Uber Eats like eat this and whatever like some cheese and crackers or something for lunch. And they're all like still sitting there, you know.
20:46:32 So, anyway, I think it's,
20:46:35 I think it could work I think I'm still missing a step between the planning and execution phase.
20:46:44 Yeah. So, what do you think would help.
20:47:00 What would be like the intermediate step, like for you. What does that look like for you.
20:46:58 I think it's hard because I think it's like mutually reinforcing like if I feel better if I have more energy, if I can say like, Oh, I'm gonna wake up, you know half an hour before work, and like make eggs.
20:47:16 Then I'll feel better throughout the day.
20:47:18 And they'll feel better after work you know and so it all kind of builds on itself but I don't do that, I like stay up too late. And then I sleep into late and I wake up, it's time for work and then I need to over caffeinated to like get through the day
20:47:32 and then I feel like shit because I'm over caffeinated, and then work and.
20:47:37 And I'm exhausted and I don't have the energy to cook. And so I lie in bed. And then I do it again and like, it's just, I know if I like kind of interfered at one of those steps if I said like, I'm gonna go to bed earlier I'm gonna, you know, drink tea
20:47:55 instead of coffee or whatever it is like that if I can break that cycle somehow, then.
20:48:02 Even if I just like shifted half an hour earlier an hour earlier like and make better use of my time like that I will feel better throughout the day. And then I'll feel better throughout the week and then I'll have the time and the energy to like do the
20:48:14 things that I want to do that right now I'm just like, I can't cook because I can't clean up because I'm like, I would literally die if I had to spend like two hours in my kitchen after work.
20:48:29 Mm hmm.
20:48:29 No. I rely on so many levels. This is not about me though it's about you.
20:48:37 And I kind of have an idea that I'd like to throw out there. Um, you mentioned kind of having this like cascading effect and then we're like if you could just intervene what.
20:48:41 Yeah. What if, like you cook breakfast, like that could be the one meal a day that you cook. And that could be the intervening steps to set you up. Like I'm just throwing it out there yeah no I like it.
20:49:01 Okay.
20:49:02 And so, you mentioned, eggs, or your usual like go to breakfast meal.
20:49:11 It depends.
20:49:14 So okay, most mornings.
20:49:17 I start setting alarms at like 815, I really don't wake up until 9am, and then I'm like oh shit i have to work. So I don't eat normally until like 11 or 1130 when I'm like starting to actually feel hungry.
20:49:32 And at that point like so this morning I ate like leftover pizza for breakfast basically because it's 1130, most mornings I'm like oh I'll order coffee from Starbucks and so I'll get like a breakfast sandwich as well.
20:49:46 If I'm making breakfast myself.
20:49:49 Eggs are definitely a go to.
20:49:53 I've got like oatmeal and stuff too I've got cereal.
20:49:58 got toaster waffles so like I have other options for breakfast.
20:50:04 Eggs tend to be the go to but again it's like really kind of whatever I'm feeling and so if I'm like oh I've got leftover whatever right now I've got like Pad Thai like that might be breakfast tomorrow at this point.
20:50:20 So, yeah.
20:50:22 Okay.
20:50:36 Um, so it sounds like also like managing those cravings, is a part of, like a step in there somewhere like how do you go about managing those.
20:50:38 And, and
20:50:41 and trying to think like
20:50:46 a one meal a day can we make this work. Yeah.
20:50:51 I think we could. I think the other thing too that I thought of when I was explaining the cascade I think that my bedtime like is kind of the piece in the cascade that I could intervene and that would really have like those good effects because I'll look
20:51:10 up and I realize it's like 132 o'clock in the morning and I'm like oh shit like, how did we get here. Um, and so even if it was like, no screens after midnight or like, I mean I'm, I'm in bed already so like being in bed at a certain time doesn't do it
20:51:30 for me but just like, okay, you have to actually like try to sleep starting a certain time, because then I wouldn't be as tired in the morning I could get up I could make breakfast I could you know, be more set for the day, whereas right now I'm like,
20:51:44 I'll do my first half of my work day like from bed, basically, and I know I'm not productive I know it's not good for my back like I know all of these things it's just like between the knowing and the doing.
20:51:58 Yeah. Um, can I ask what you do for work.
20:52:02 I, I do like recruiting or onboarding for tele health company.
20:52:08 So I mostly work from home.
20:52:11 But I can go into the office like if in when I want to go.
20:52:19 Yeah. Um, okay so sorry I want to go to like two different directions but really quickly. Okay, um, one question that I meant to ask you early on, is about like your stress level.
20:52:30 So on a scale of one to 10, like what's your stress level for this week, where one is not stressed, and like, 10 is like significantly stress.
20:52:42 It's probably like a six or seven.
20:52:44 Okay.
20:52:48 Um, so this is something that I'm just going to check in with you about. Often, or once a week.
20:52:55 And then, if you want to create a health goal around it, we could. But going back to like what you were saying about like how sleep can be your inner meaning stuff.
20:53:07 One thing is establishing a sleep routine. And so having like a set schedule, not a schedule but kind of like a somewhat of a schedule to get your body prepared to sleep.
20:53:23 And so, like people set alarms. If you want to start winding down at 11pm, like that's your wind downtime like no screen. You drink a cup of tea, you wash your face you brush your teeth like.
20:53:36 We can also kind of go in that direction. Yeah.
20:53:41 Now that sounds like it would be good because I feel like right now like I finished work today I cleaned up I did some stuff around the house like I took my last phone call in bed I'm taking this call in bed.
20:53:52 I get up and like, do some stuff in the kitchen finish some things. Next thing I know it's going to be like midnight but like I kind of live in and out of my bed until there's no set like, Okay, this time I'm in bed to actually sleep.
20:54:10 So I think yeah I think even saying like, Okay, I'm gonna turn off the TV I'm going to you know, wash my face brush my teeth like, or even take a shower like.
20:54:22 And then I'm going to get into bed and I'm going to like, actually close my eyes and go to sleep.
20:54:28 I think that that would benefit me but I think bigger too is like not using my bed for non sleep things like work and calls and, you know, everything else like because I feel like, especially on the weekends I spend like the whole day in bed, you know.
20:54:48 Yeah. Um, so do you have, like other spaces to do your work from a deal. I have a desk.
20:54:56 And it's kind of cluttered and so it's not.
20:55:01 it's kind of it stresses me out.
20:55:03 And then I have a couch,
20:55:07 which works sometimes but is not comfortable and it's not good for my back and stuff as well so I do have other spaces that I normally do work there especially if I'm like on a zoom call or something where I need to be like more presentable.
20:55:22 Um, but a lot of my work is just like administrative like I'm just clicking buttons and sending emails and so I can do that in bed, you know no one knows that I'm like not awake yet.
20:55:35 No.
20:55:35 Okay. So, for, for, you know, do we want like.
20:55:42 I think you have three really big goals in mind, and I would want to pair, like, two of them together, instead of doing all three at once because I feel like these are again like big goals.
20:55:55 So we have like making one meal a day as a big goal, establishing asleep routine as a second big goal, and then not using your bed as an office space, a third goal.
20:56:09 So, I guess like of these three, like, what are the what are the two that you want to like, like create a SMART goal for the second one was establishing a sleep routine right.
20:56:25 Yeah. So I'm feel like two and three like match like they're almost one goal, you know, and so I feel like,
20:56:35 yeah, if I was more deliberate about like the time I'm spending in bed to sleep and the time I'm spending out of my bed to do my life like
20:56:45 I feel like I could just like two birds one stone, those two.
20:56:50 Okay.
20:56:52 Um, I think so too. And also,
20:56:57 I am I am separating them because like we're gonna measure them differently.
20:57:05 Okay, cool.
20:57:06 Um, so, I think the, the
20:57:12 going with the third one first, and then we'll go back to the sleep routine.
20:57:17 So like in this next week, or I may be like by Sunday, Monday, you can say like by Wednesday.
20:57:27 I'll clean my desk or.
20:57:31 Actually no, sorry, that was a bad example let's go with.
20:57:35 For this next week, I will not use my bed as an office space or I will use my desk, and then you can tell me for like three of the seven days or five of the seven days like whatever feels most attainable to you.
20:57:53 Yeah, that makes sense. Um, I think we should do it out of five days because it's really only for work days.
20:58:02 But we could do.
20:58:09 I think the hard part for me is like I do like half days so like I spend my morning in bed and then it by the afternoon I'm at my desk, so I could almost say like, oh yeah I do make it to my desk five days a week but like that's obviously not the point.
20:58:23 So I'm trying to measure like.
20:58:29 Yeah, I think.
20:58:33 I think we could say for four out of the five next business days like.
20:58:41 I will work at my desk and not in my bed.
20:58:49 So, depending on like when we see each other next. So if we schedule, our next session for next Monday, then your day your four days, start tomorrow, right, and go until Friday.
20:59:06 If we meet like if we meet on like a Wednesday or Thursday, then you have like a little more time to go, but I just, I just want you to have that in mind, to hit the ground running.
20:59:18 Yeah. So, and I know you mentioned like your office, I mean your office, your desk space feeling like not so inviting to do work. Is there anything that you can do to like make it more.
20:59:35 Your Spirit your workspace.
20:59:38 I actually need to clean everything like tonight and tomorrow I've got.
20:59:45 I've got a zoom call tomorrow, where I have to like show my apartment and so that's kind of motivated stressful. I know it is I'm, I'm adopting a cat and they have to like see like what my environment looks like.
21:00:00 So that's kind of my motivation right now to like get all this shit done tonight and tomorrow. I'm at my desk like isn't that important but like if I could even tidy it up a little bit or like, I've got like snacks and stuff like on my desk that like
21:00:16 reach for during the workday and if I like put them in the kitchen, you know, and
21:00:24 just kind of tidy up a little bit like I could do that and I have to do that before tomorrow anyway so, Um, yes, it's possible.
21:00:34 I won't, I won't like make that like a part of your health goal, but it sounds really like important to help you achieve your health goal.
21:00:45 Um, so, I have here in the next week, I will not use my bed as office space for four of the five days.
21:01:02 Oh business.
21:01:00 Okay.
21:01:02 Okay. And then, I'm kind of like a similar scale question. On a scale of one to 10, what's your level of confidence in meeting your SMART goal where one is not confident and 10 is confident.
21:01:20 Probably like a five.
21:01:24 Okay.
21:01:26 I feel like a few minutes when I wake up like any motivation is just it's gone, like,
21:01:35 um, so let's, let's go back to it then. So, do you think four out of the five business days is too much, or what can we do, we can do like half days, or no cuz I, I was thinking about that too and I was thinking about saying three out of five but I feel
21:02:00 like sorry like this.
21:02:02 No no no I said four out of five. But I was debating between three or four like I feel like this is a habit, I actually want to kick. And so, if I give myself like leeway to not kick it.
21:02:17 I'm just gonna find like the loophole. You know I'm gonna be like, Oh, it's okay if I like working bad until like 10am like as long as I get, you know, and I don't like, because it is such a like whatever the cycle like the morning sets me up for not
21:02:38 being successful for the rest of the day. And so I would rather just like, and I forgot tomorrow morning I have to run an errand at 8am anyway and so like I have to get up I have to hit the ground running and so I'll come back and I'll be awake and out
21:02:52 of bed by the time I start work like.
21:02:56 And I know that I'm more successful on those days than on the ones where I let myself stay in bed until 10 or 11. So, I think it's going to be hard, I think.
21:03:09 I think three days like yes definitely I could do that I think four days would be a challenge I don't think it would be impossible. So I'm okay leaving it where it is, but I'm also recognizing my own like I have great intentions now but when I wake up
21:03:22 tomorrow morning.
21:03:25 They're not going to be there anymore.
21:03:28 Yeah.
21:03:30 So,
21:03:34 with the confidence scale.
21:03:39 Anything below seven is something that we need to reevaluate. Okay.
21:03:49 And you tell me five at the time, right.
21:03:52 You can change it to three out of five days.
21:03:53 And so,
21:03:55 okay, what would be your competition. Well, we could say seven.
21:04:00 Okay.
21:04:03 Um, so, and also we can create like ways to help boost your confidence or in achieving it. So I think in.
21:04:14 In the communications class we talk about like self efficacy and how like how important so so this is the self efficacy question.
21:04:24 And it could be a real determinant of like you being successful in your goals.
21:04:30 And so, what are things that you can do to help you be successful in these goals for example like as a health coach I can text you like every day at like nine o'clock, or something, and say like, Hey, I don't know how you feel.
21:05:01 Yeah, like if you're comfortable with me kind of calling you out and
21:04:56 I think that'd be fine, I think.
21:04:59 And this is kind of tying back into Goal number two, like if I feel well rested in the morning, it's easier for me to like get up and say like, I'm going to walk to Starbucks so that by the time I get back I'm feeling like super super motivated, you know,
21:05:16 or I'm going to get up and I'm going to make breakfast or I'm going to you know, start work early or whatever, like I know tomorrow I've got that appointment and then Wednesday I have to start work early.
21:05:26 So those are already going to be two days that are going to be like different from the normal routine.
21:05:31 But that I'll actually have to like kick myself to do.
21:05:39 Um, so I, I almost feel like falling asleep earlier will help me wake up earlier will help me get to my desk like.
21:05:48 But I don't know if that is too far into a different goal to say like,
21:05:55 I'm going to go to bed earlier so that I make it to my desk in the morning, you know.
21:06:01 Yeah, I think there is a connection, like in terms of like the behavior change overall, but like for example if you make it to your desk three out of five days, like you been successful in meeting your goal, but if you don't keep your sleep routine.
21:06:19 Like, we can say like, either way you were still really successful in this yeah like that let's lean into that, what made it to where, like, what, Why were you successful in this goal but not this goal.
21:06:31 And so it'll help us evaluate it, and not lumped together because I think that's oftentimes we do lump so many things together and we're like, oh, we failed like I didn't do this and I didn't do that and we get overwhelmed.
21:06:44 And so if we just really isolate the small achievable goals. It'll like build.
21:06:51 It sounds good.
21:06:52 Okay, cool.
21:06:55 Um, so, I think transitioning to that that sleep routine goal.
21:07:00 What's a good bet I'm.
21:07:07 Are you are like maybe wine downtime will go with white and downtime.
21:07:14 Um,
21:07:14 I would say like midnight, no more screens would be a good goal, like and I have like the bedtime feature set up on my phone. So it like will turn on Do Not Disturb at midnight or whatever and I just like override it.
21:07:28 And then the next thing I know it's 130 in the morning and I'm like, oh my god I was supposed to be asleep, you know, so I think it's my like at midnight plugged in my phone like away from my bed, that's the other thing right now too is like I haven't
21:07:41 been charging my phone at night I've just been like leaving it in my bed, and then charging it in the morning.
21:07:51 So then it's like dead all day but it also like keeps me up.
21:07:57 But it also wakes me up because it's my alarm so I'm like trying to find that like kind of happy medium where I'm like maybe I plug it in like out of reach, but still somewhere I can get to it in the morning so I'm not like waking up all my all my neighbors
21:08:11 or anything that would also make me get out of bed. If I had to get up and go to, instead of just rolling over and turning it off.
21:08:23 Anyway.
21:08:25 Can I, can I ask real quick. Do you set your alarm. Every night, or do you just have it automatically going off at like,
21:08:35 okay, so wonder if like you set an alarm, like a daily alarm to go off at midnight. And that could be like, set your alarm for tomorrow morning. And then that could be like, plugging your phone like you could, like, it's like your cue to start this league
21:08:54 routine. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, it does make sense out of it. What are your thoughts about that.
21:09:01 Yeah, I like that I, that just reminded me like I take my birth control at 1030 and so that's almost like a start of like.
21:09:11 That's like my like I'm done with doing things I need to do like I'm gonna get into bed and I'm like wasting time and bad whatever on my phone or watching a movie or reading a book or whatever.
21:09:22 And then it cascades to 2am so like, that's almost like catalyst one, and then catalyst to needs to be put away your phone and actually like try to sleep.
21:09:36 yeah.
21:09:39 So,
21:09:48 you have an a daily alarm for 1030. So, if you set a daily alarm for 12am.
21:09:57 That, that alarm will cue you to set morning alarm
21:10:05 and plug and plug in your phone.
21:10:08 Yeah.
21:10:11 Um, and then specifically like away from your bed. But, like, close enough to turn strange Yeah, yeah.
21:10:20 And then, is there anything else that you want to do a part of it like your sleep routine for example.
21:10:31 Okay.
21:10:33 I don't know why I came up to came to mind to like drink a glass of water like before going to bed, that can make people go to the bathroom at night so I don't know, I don't know where you're at on that scale, but,
21:10:48 like, when I get up to plug in my phone like I'm already up but that's like that could be like brush teeth use the bathroom, like, Okay.
21:10:59 Do bedtime things, you know.
21:11:02 Yeah. Do men like listing those for me.
21:11:21 I
21:11:23 don't have a cat right now but I might have one and I've had one in the past and it's normally like put out the cats food.
21:11:34 Turn on the porch light, make sure the front doors locked.
21:11:44 Yeah.
21:11:46 This is great. Um, one thing that is not part of your health goals specifically but has been helpful in the past, in terms of sleep routine is reading with a soft light.
21:12:00 Okay.
21:12:02 And so that kind of takes you away from the screen.
21:12:07 I don't know if that's something you want to include or not we don't have to, of course.
21:12:11 I'm yeah it's something I do sometimes, um, and almost even most of the time, but
21:12:21 not all the time. So, I'll put optional reading yeah yeah that works I'm like I don't want to like lock myself into it but like I do, do it.
21:12:31 Yeah.
21:12:34 Well that was another issue was like I stayed up until 4am reading the other night and said it has to be like, Like, yeah.
21:12:46 Okay, cool.
21:12:48 I think the other thing I just wanted to say, as an option is journaling, so kind of like journaling and reading are like winding down activity.
21:12:58 Okay, so here's, here's what I have for you. Okay. And we haven't really made it specific they're measurable I mean measurable yet, but we'll, we'll get there.
21:13:24 So, I'm studying a daily alarm for midnight.
21:13:15 So at midnight. You will then set your morning alarm plug in your phone, brush your teeth, use the bathroom, put out cat food turned on porch light. Check front door.
21:13:27 Optional reading.
21:13:28 Yes.
21:13:30 That, that's going to be your.
21:13:34 Yeah, yeah. Your sleeper like your your sleep routine, like establishing your sleep routine.
21:13:40 So then the next question is like, like how often do you want to do it.
21:13:56 Um, maybe like four nights a week, because I'm like weeknights
21:14:02 weeknights but it doesn't even need to be every weeknight because once in a while I have other things going on or I can stay up late or whatever but yeah maybe four nights a week.
21:14:14 And then the here we're not doing like business nights were doing like for the week. Okay.
21:14:20 Um, so we can make this more specific if you want for example you can do like.
21:14:28 Tuesday Night Wednesday night, Saturday night and Sunday night, and that'll, those will be here for, but we can also keep it really open, and you just have to be that you're, like, Yeah, when you're going to do it, we have to remember to do it.
21:14:46 Yeah, I would say, Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday
21:14:55 Mondays, Thursdays are optional.
21:14:59 Okay.
21:15:01 So, since we're meeting again next Monday.
21:15:09 It would have to be Sunday.
21:15:12 Or sorry yeah you can do it on Sunday, and you can do it on Tuesday.
21:15:16 And then you can do it on Wednesday.
21:15:20 But there's tuesday wednesday thursday Sunday.
21:15:28 Okay.
21:15:31 Could we also not do Mondays by any chance by 730 meeting is like every week.
21:15:48 Um, okay. Later it doesn't need to be No, no, yeah, we're kind of like transitioning out to so I'll put it on up Monday back on here and then you can like decide.
21:15:57 Is there anything that you want to add in terms of like things that are going to help you meet this goal.
21:16:12 Um,
21:16:12 no.
21:16:12 Okay.
21:16:24 Um, and then I had another question. Oh confidence level where we at this one.
21:16:29 We could say seven.
21:16:31 Okay.
21:16:34 I told you the secrets of the traders yeah that's okay.
21:16:42 I'm in the trade.
21:16:51 And then we'll, we'll take it, we'll take it from there.
21:16:55 You're welcome to have the same goals next week by the way if you feel like they, they're still relevant.
21:17:01 Um, and then I remember the question I was going to ask, is the relevant question like, just as a quick little summary like why are these two health goals important to you,
21:17:15 to have more energy to get through the day tomorrow.
21:17:19 Yeah.
21:17:20 Okay.
21:17:21 And also, like, take care of yourself.
21:17:25 Yeah.
21:17:27 Okay.
21:17:31 Um, so, uh, next I will email these to you if you're if you're needing any resources, you're like a jasmine I need like a planner template or like, whatever the case may be, just let me know.
21:17:41 I'll send that over.
21:17:43 And then the text messages you'll continue to receive those daily.
21:17:49 Feel free to respond to them I'm on the other end so I'll get your responses. Um, and then when you said no Mondays, no to Mondays.
21:18:02 No Mondays and Wednesdays I have class on Wednesdays. Okay.
21:18:04 So, I have. I don't have at this point we're meeting next week anyway. Okay, so, Thursday.
21:18:13 I can do a check like multiple schedule so I apologize, I'm pretty sure I can do 515, or 615 next Thursday.
21:18:23 Let's do 615 ever work meeting, technically scheduled until 530 even though normally ends earlier so she's just not but go for it.
21:18:31 Okay. And then, the 615 work for the next Thursday.
21:18:38 That's fine.
21:18:39 Okay, Alyssa new updated calendar invites.
21:18:44 Okay, cool. Um,
21:18:50 I was just gonna let you know one of the texts like didn't come through right, just so you know for future reference like, yeah, you might have seen it.
21:18:59 Did it come through again the second time I sent it like in the afternoon.
21:19:04 Oh yeah, it did. I didn't realize they were supposed to be the same, but yeah I did.
21:19:09 Yeah, I'm not sure what happened, I'm responsible for those type of messages I'm a little embarrassed.
21:19:17 But hopefully, hopefully the next one will come through and no hiccups like that.
