17:07:28 What do you normally do, like outside of your work time.

17:07:44 work or like prep for school.

17:08:35 So, I don't think they're kind of like lifting up so I am kind of, I mean I'm, I'm fully vaccinated and like I know that that's not totally like still, you know, I just don't get captured, but I'm kind of, I feel a little bit more comfortable now that
17:08:52 everyone's kind of vaccinating and things are opening back up and I just really need to like get out of the Sacramento for a bit so I planned a couple of trips.
17:09:05 Yeah, I think that's a really great thing to do.
17:09:09 And you're trying to do it in the best or the safest way possible. So there's some comfortable or comfortability there. Yeah, well that sounds really fun.
17:09:20 I haven't been to either of those places, but photos and they just look amazing.
17:09:28 Yeah.
17:09:30 Um, well, it sounds like you're, you're driving right now or are you just in your.
17:09:40 I guess what's in it ok so my car but I'm driving home I just gotta work.
17:09:44 Okay. Well, I have you on the audio book.
17:09:48 Yeah, thanks so much for accommodating the change in schedule. Um, do feel comfortable just continuing our session by you, Dr.
17:09:59 Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, I have to have you on the car audio so.
17:10:07 Okay, sounds good. Yeah.
17:10:10 Um, so I'll go ahead and get started. I'm asking just a few of like the general questions. Um, so you've been receiving the text messages every morning around 9am.
17:10:35 Um, yeah there was one of them that I really liked
17:10:43 the one where it was like, kind of like springs coming in and like kind of go outside take a break.
17:10:50 I really liked that one and then the one yesterday was the fruit, that one's really made me crazy throat, and so I realized I mean is also like a healthy way to kind of go about it so I like that one.
17:11:05 Yeah.
17:11:06 Cool. I'm curious. So with the spring one kind of promoting taking a break. Were you able to take a break and anyway.
17:11:17 Yeah, so for that one. I thought actually when I was on my walk I usually do like walks on my brakes at work and so I was on my daily like morning walk and I saw that and I was like oh like what a coincidence but yeah ok cool, so it didn't it.
17:11:34 Yeah.
17:11:45 Um, okay, Cool. Any other comments around the text messages.
17:11:54 Everybody.
17:11:54 So then, the other question is around your stress.
17:12:00 On a scale of one to 10 but was your week.
17:12:15 Okay, so did you say five.
17:12:19 Yeah.
17:12:20 Cool.
17:12:22 So now that we got those questions out of the way.
17:12:26 I'm, tell me a little bit about how it went with your health goal and.
17:12:32 On a scale of one to 10 How do you think you did in meeting your health goal.
17:12:42 Um,
17:12:44 to South Carolina. And then I have like the extra science one for the self care I really like meds, I kind of went above and beyond. I think I really kind of emphasize on, I ended up finishing my assignments for my class early and so after that I kind
17:13:02 of just really tried to do something every single night.
17:13:07 And so I went out by some face mask and kind of
17:13:17 did that every single night. Really, I definitely met that goal.
17:13:20 And I really liked it because it kind of made me really focused on kind of just like having me time.
17:13:27 However, that looks like. And then for the exercising goal I did meet that one. However, for the exercising one, I think I kind of want to maybe like increase, but I don't.
17:13:44 can you read me what the goal is again.
17:13:47 Yeah, let me have to go back to the email to to let's see what we wrote for that one. so give me one second.
17:14:04 So, we had said you would practice. Oh no, sorry, I'm, you'll be physically active for at least 30 minutes on two different days.
17:14:19 Yeah, definitely met that one.
17:14:24 I think it was that one as well I kind of felt God to like meet the goal and kind of like, you know, kind of, keep going. I was a little tired oh four, but
17:14:38 definitely like, once I got like my endorphins like rushing through me like it. I felt really good.
17:14:45 So there was a lot of positive effects from meeting both your goals.
17:14:53 Yeah.
17:14:54 Cool.
17:14:57 Um, so you want to speak more to those positive effects,
17:15:06 taking care of yourself, or the exercise one.
17:15:14 Yeah, I mean, I think those like like what that looks like or, like, how does that.
17:15:22 Oh, yeah. Um, so I think it's more like, I'm thinking of it as a reflective question like, what did self care do for you, like, in a positive way. What did exercise do for you.
17:15:44 And can it motivate you to continue to do that.
17:15:45 Like self care, kind of just made me be more in like the present and kind of, like, I'm much of a like scheduler and try to like plan out things and kind of always try to like keep ahead and so I feel like with self care like it makes me really like being
17:16:07 in the present and also realize like, I can only do so much. And so it makes me want to relax and also kind of just like, you know, kind of just to be like, happy and grateful and that like moment.
17:16:24 And they also like just brings me joy.
17:16:27 And then for exercising feel like it definitely
17:16:35 makes me feel a lot better about myself, like, if this is my self esteem.
17:16:46 That's really powerful, like you said, so many like like awesome things like be more relaxed, be more grateful joyfulness and happiness and like feeling better about yourself and increase your self esteem, like, just those two things.
17:17:05 I make, making you put in a lot of hard work and they think it paid off.
17:17:14 Yeah, definitely.
17:17:16 Cool.
17:17:17 So, um, what, where would you like to go with your health goals this week.
17:17:30 I want to challenge myself to, kind of, because I. This next, the next two weeks I'm not in class.
17:17:40 I definitely want to challenge myself to increase like the amount of one exercise will try to go, you know, at least,
17:17:51 like daily if I can kind of just to get back in the routine of things but also it is going to become a challenging because I will be like I'm a challenge really the weekend and stuff, but I do also find, you know, like ways to do that.
17:18:12 And then for self care I think that kind of comes in where kind of just like take care of myself.
17:18:25 During this during like, you know, two weeks I and kind of off.
17:18:30 So it sounds like you want to keep the same goals, but like, make them a little more challenging, so that you can build a routine.
17:18:42 Yeah. So like I said, I think it's two days that I have like, I think I can do like more.
17:19:00 Okay.
17:19:00 So, let me write down the first one and then we can circle back to the self care one.
17:19:09 So in the next week you will be physically active for at least 30 minutes on four different days. Does that sound accurate.
17:19:22 Yes.
17:19:22 Okay. And then, um, so you mentioned last week that this goal was important to you, because it will help increase your energy and be a healthier person.
17:19:29 Do you want to add anything to those to like the relevance or the importance of this goal for you
17:19:58 decided they're like it
17:20:01 like this My like self esteem and confidence level.
17:20:08 Also, yeah.
17:20:14 Yeah, definitely.
17:20:15 Okay, so I'm on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting this SMART goal.
17:20:31 Yeah.
17:20:38 I think that's really gonna leave that one.
17:20:43 Yeah.
17:20:50 Alrighty.
17:20:43 So then, I'm going to your second goal around self care period previously we had specified in the next week you will practice at least 30 minutes of self care specifically painting on the three different days, did you end up painting, sorry I didn't ask
17:21:06 that before.
17:21:23 I did but I also incorporated other things that kind of like self care, but you know now that I'm thinking about it. I actually add, I just like to leave that one out for next week and just added people.
17:21:28 Yes, you can. you can definitely do that.
17:21:32 Okay. I think something that I kind of like really kind of identified lately on like a, like either like kind of like trying to do exercise, kind of exercise and kind of just, you know, that kind of eating out.
17:21:49 I kind of forget to meal prep or quote unquote forget my lunch at home in the morning of the day so like I tend to go out for lunch and not choose like the healthiest option.
17:22:03 So baby probably like, just like a meal, happy and then like eating, and, like, I don't want to be like, at least three times, another five days of the week
17:22:23 was kind of balancing out like the lifestyle.
17:22:28 So, um, do we do you want to specify lunch, as like the meal that you're going to commit this to, or do you want to be flexible.
17:22:42 And, and we can write this goal a couple of ways as in like, you can reduce your consumption of fast food or increase your consumption of like me, homemade food or food that you've made yourself.
17:23:01 So what what feels more appropriate for you like specifying it to like lunch or dinner or reducing or increasing.
17:23:14 I think, increasing my intake of homemade food.
17:23:25 So, in the next week you will make three homemade meals. Is that where you want to go.
17:23:38 Yeah, we could do that.
17:23:40 Okay, sorry, those more clarification question, if I understood it all correctly.
17:23:48 Yeah.
17:23:54 And it wouldn't be,
17:23:53 like, three, three homemade meals a week, but can we just like tie down to lunch, getting me, I usually like skip breakfast.
17:24:03 It's just lunch, kind of the meal that I kind of go out to eat or purchase.
17:24:10 Okay, I think I'm understanding now. Okay, so.
17:24:22 Yeah.
17:24:23 And then this would like in turn reduce your purchasing a fast food.
17:24:34 Yeah.
17:24:38 Um, what are those meals that you like to eat during lunch, that you make
17:24:48 Um, it
17:25:02 really depends i mean i i am a Presbyterian.
17:25:02 Just had like vegetarian or like plant based meal.
17:25:07 So
17:25:12 it just depends but it's usually somebody was like veggies in like a car Borland veggies with like some sort of protein in it. But,
17:25:22 yeah, Yeah.
17:25:23 I'm just thinking about like the obtainable aspect of this goal.
17:25:31 Um, and so, like, in order for this to be obtainable you want to have lunch meals in mind.
17:25:40 And so we're just doing like that prep work like what do you want to prepare for yourself for lunch that you can do at home.
17:25:48 I think just like veggies, like
17:25:55 Jesus like brown rice or something and like.
17:26:07 I think that's kind of something simple and basic, I kind of my go to.
17:26:09 Okay. If you feel comfortable eating for lunch for at least three times next week, then I think you're on the right track.
17:26:18 Okay. Yeah. And then so going back to like the relevant.
17:26:23 Why is this goal important to you.
17:26:29 Um, I think it's important to have that solid solid diet.
17:26:34 I think it's also for it. If I am choosing it, you know, exercise to also kind of watch what I like. In my body.
17:26:47 You know, just to be healthier and live a longer life, that, you know.
17:26:59 Okay, so I'm just gonna repeat it back to you to make sure that I captured everything correctly. And if there's anything you'd like to add, go ahead and do that.
17:27:10 So, in the next week you will prepare three lunch meals for the week.
17:27:18 This includes like veggies brown rice with the side of protein.
17:27:24 This will help you reduce your purchasing of fast food. And also, like watch what you put in your body to lead a healthier and longer life. And the other thing that's important to you is having like a balanced diet diet.
17:27:43 Yeah, perfect, and get those a little wordy but I'll clean it up by email it back to you.
17:27:52 I was good.
17:27:53 Okay, cool. So, I'm on a scale of one to 10 What was your confidence level in meeting your, what is your confidence level and meeting this SMART goal.
17:28:05 I could do nine as well.
17:28:10 So, I'm for either of your health goals. Do you need any support from me, like either text message support or recipes.
17:28:22 Reminder messages or anything like that.
17:28:26 Um, if you could send me some, like vegetarian like recipes like some philosophies that would be nice.
17:28:34 Okay.
17:28:37 Yeah.
17:28:39 I can look at this.
17:28:42 Okay.
17:28:44 I'm on that new, do you have like favorite vegetables like I'm a big fan of like carrots and broccoli, but there's like such a variety.
17:28:55 I love bell peppers like bell peppers, onions, like peas.
17:29:01 Those are usually my go to.
17:29:04 But I, you know, broccoli and carrots are also good. I'm not really picky with veggies because that's the only thing that kind of filled me up, so I'm here for anything.
17:29:14 Alrighty, well I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.
17:29:18 Okay.
17:29:20 Um, anything else in terms of support needed.
17:29:32 I think you're doing a really good job me it's on you.
17:29:40 You're keeping me accountable. So, thank you. Thank you.
