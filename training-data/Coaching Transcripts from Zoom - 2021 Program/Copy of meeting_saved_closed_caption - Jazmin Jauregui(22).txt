18:16:13 I'm doing good how are you.
18:16:14 I'm just tired.
18:16:15 Okay, that's totally valid, this Thursday, middle of this fester. Yeah, that's true, a year into a pandemic, you know, the above.
18:16:29 I like your sweater though. Oh, thank you. Um, I don't remember I got it, but it kind of reminds me like Patagonia style stuff right yeah and like it snaps up like.
18:16:45 It was pretty comfy gotta admit, some,
18:16:50 you're located in like SF area right.
18:16:55 I'm down in.
18:16:58 Oh, it's not super cold here but my apartment gets pretty cold.
18:17:04 And then like I was just in bed I just got a new cat. So we were just in bed and then every time I get up I'm like freezing.
18:17:12 Let's see.
18:17:20 She'll probably walk across the screen at some point, she's pretty friendly. Yeah.
18:17:21 So you became a cat mom I care.
18:17:25 Exactly I keep calling myself mommy I'm like, oh mommy's gotta get up know like.
18:17:38 Mommy's eating that's not yours. I'm like, Oh, I'm in. But that's okay like the transformation has begun.
18:17:48 Really, three days into cat ownership and like what am I going to be like with an actual child, but yeah she's fun. What did you name her or did she come name. She came named her name's Taiga. It's TAIKA.
18:18:14 And she's 15, so I was like we're just going to keep the name like she's, she's not really responsive to it but I was like whatever she's, she's had it and I like it and so what sounds pretty badass.
18:18:14 Yeah, pretty cool.
18:18:14 I'm also super like not in line with like the thing, but you're getting a tattoo right oh yeah I did, I got it on Saturday.
18:18:26 Go, I don't know. Um, it was good, it's, it's starting to itch.
18:18:33 Just like in process was just annoying I have to like avoid scratching it.
18:18:38 So I'm like scratching it like through my pants so that I don't mess it up.
18:18:46 But what it went well, it was like three hours over this past weekend and then we'll do like two or three more hours to color it in, in a couple of weeks.
18:18:58 So, yeah, it went up, it's like, almost bigger than I thought it would be. And so it's gonna be like wearing shorts all summer my family's gonna be like what.
18:19:13 What's that, whatever, that's fine.
18:19:13 I'm excited. That's also will promise you I when I got my tattoo it's tiny I don't know if you can like see it.
18:19:22 So, Sorry. No, I see.
18:19:25 Um, I used to put chapstick on it to like help with the edging smart.
18:19:29 That's very smart. I'm like, allergic to a lot of lotions and stuff so I have to be super careful about what I put on it but I bought it with Neil sporran yesterday and I've been using.
18:19:41 And then just trying to where like soft clothes are like this is a dress I put on pants with it but last night I like didn't wear pants with it just so he could like breathe a little bit.
18:19:53 But yeah, it's like, it's a process.
18:19:57 But it's good.
18:20:00 I'm excited. And I know it's not my body, but I'm excited for the result.
18:20:06 Yeah, I like it, I like I'm happy with it, so far so it's good.
18:20:14 Um, well, can you believe it's already here. Third, coaching session. No, it's hard to believe.
18:20:22 It's kind of wild.
18:20:25 This one was a little bit harder to track it wasn't as hard to do, but it was a little bit harder to like measure it, which one I know you had two goals.
18:20:39 Specifically, I'm like I feel like drink more water than I track, but
18:20:47 that one was harder, and I know we talked about like the one hydro floss but then like I drink water outside of that as well and so like for example last Friday night.
18:20:57 I went out drinking.
18:21:00 And I know how much fun it was, that was gonna say a mistake but it wasn't a mistake, it was in like an undergrad college like haven't been that messy in a long time.
18:21:12 I'm looking, fun, and like I know I drink, tons of water, but it was like out of glasses and out of, you know, a plastic water bottle and so I'm like I can't even quantify how much I drink.
18:21:28 And that kind of came up a couple of times and then also I know we talked about this to like when I start my day when it's half full. I just like finish it and I refill it and then it's like whoa was that 32 ounces or was that you know 20 year, whatever.
18:21:43 That one was just a little bit harder to measure but I thought it was a good practice she so might keep that goal.
18:21:53 And then the steps one was easy to measure because my phone does it for me. But it was a little bit harder to do so like yesterday.
18:22:03 I didn't have enough steps basically and had to run an errand in the evening and was like oh I'll just walk, instead of driving and like got the steps in that way but that one had to be more mindful.
18:22:26 So I honestly might keep that one too. Um,
18:22:23 let's see, I think.
18:22:27 What was the day that we met last week, I believe it was Thursday.
18:22:31 So I hit it, I got 4000 steps Thursday, Saturday. Monday and Wednesday. It was four days right it was applied, I forget what we said it was for yeah yeah I hit it it was just like I had to be a little more intentional about hitting that one, as opposed
18:22:51 Um, but yeah i mean i liked them both and I feel like they were kind of the right level of challenging that like I had to actually do it, not just something I was kind of already doing some, huh.
18:23:11 Yeah.
18:23:13 So, I'm like, on a scale of one to 10 How do you think you did in meeting your goals.
18:23:24 I'm the steps one I'd say like,
18:23:28 probably a nine if only 10.
18:23:33 There were some days where I like barely scraped by or I got like 4010 steps.
18:23:40 Oh, if I need to like do this before I go to bed.
18:23:45 By dead technically, hit that goal, and then the water one probably like a six or seven, I think I was looking at it right before the call I think I've got
18:23:59 maybe four days worth of water but not all four of those days.
18:24:05 Hit 64 ounces, but it was also like did I track everything or did I actually not drink that much water.
18:24:13 So that one's a little bit lower, but still, still overall accomplished.
18:24:18 Yeah, I think I'm like looking at the barriers right I you identified the measuring or the tracking one.
18:24:29 The water goal was a challenge so it makes sense why it was hard to.
18:24:35 It's hard to gauge like how successful you were had you achieved it.
18:24:41 I wonder, like, I'm not a big fan of like using plastic water bottles but like if we had said like plastic water bottles that are like already filled for you, you can start a fresh one, it would have been easier, maybe easier to see the progress.
18:24:57 Or maybe saying that, like, a number of glasses are like all sip of water, 20 times a day, I don't know, like, neither of those would have been easy to quantify either but I think it would have been a little bit less restrictive than like it has to be
18:25:16 this 32 ounce hydro flask, you know, huh. Yeah.
18:25:22 So, and I also heard you like want to keep working on these schools and maybe even continue them for this week.
18:25:32 Yeah, possibly, probably, I was trying to think of other ones and I'm like, I can't.
18:25:40 I don't know if there's something else. well, maybe I like made a meal plan last night for the upcoming week, I'm, I'm going out of town next weekend's.
18:25:50 So like a week from tomorrow. So I want to finish up like the food that I have in my fridge and stuff.
18:26:02 I'm also ran out of my Uber Eats money from work for the month. I'm on my own food wise.
18:26:13 So I I made the plan like sticking to the plan would be a good goal, because I feel like it's hard and like today, I, I know what I want to make for dinner like I had a Hello Fresh kit delivered today.
18:26:29 But like an hour or two ago I was like, Ooh, I'm craving like a sandwich from the sandwich spot I like.
18:26:38 I'm just like oh I could technically like there's nothing stopping me from going and doing that, you know, I bought the ingredients like I could make it.
18:26:47 Yeah, that's just more labor intensive. Um, but yeah, maybe your house, how long does it take you to like make a sandwich vs order and have it delivered, or.
18:27:02 That's a good question. This one's not on Uber Eats and so I would actually have to go drive and get it probably be like, at least 45 minutes if not like an hour to like leave here go order wait for it, pick it up and drive home like it would take less
18:27:19 time to make it It wouldn't be as satisfying,
18:27:25 but it would also be healthier.
18:27:32 So yeah, I mean it's a it's a pros and cons to be exactly yeah and it's not the meal that I put on the tracker for today you know and so then I would have to punt that to tomorrow or whatever because I don't want this food to go bad either.
18:27:43 But yeah, I don't know maybe sticking to the tracker would be a good one for this week just because I already feel like I'm going to struggle with it.
18:27:50 And having some level of accountability might make that a little bit more attainable. So, yeah. And, um, the other thing I'll add, because you didn't mention like wanting to be less wasteful.
18:28:05 So if you eat, or if you make your sandwich tonight. It'll help you meet that like gold to, like, you're not going to waste your food.
18:28:15 You'll save a little bit of money save a lot of time because 45 minutes is a good chunk of time.
18:28:23 And also you can pick another day. Once you get that Uber Eats money to go Oh wait, it's not an overage.
18:28:33 It's a restaurant that's at home to the when I'm home next weekend like I could go there and you know like it could be like, not a reward but like a special occasion kind of a thing instead of like I'm just crazy now and Thursday night because I'm tired
18:28:47 and hungry, you know, hey stop scratching my couch, know how much their discussion posts for you.
18:28:58 telco, get your stuff together.
18:29:01 Hey, then.
18:29:06 Come here.
18:29:05 Sorry, I thought you were scratching again I didn't mean to yell at you. I'm sorry.
18:29:14 I love her but she's kind of a brat. And she's funny she gets into things like I wouldn't think she could get into come in.
18:29:21 But the kid for you. Yeah, exactly. Like she got into the bathroom cabinet the other day and I was like, how did you even manage to do that. She
18:29:32 says big cat. Yeah, she is a size. Yeah, she is she's a cutie.
18:29:42 And she's stubborn she's a low grandma she's an old lady. So, you know, they the older they get right there they're set in their ways, pretty much yet.
18:29:54 And like going to have to clip her nails at some point and I'm just like, Oh, I don't know how we're going to do that.
18:30:01 But I guess what
18:30:05 are you gonna get her like a little lesion Walker. I don't know if she would let me.
18:30:11 I've got a color for her but I haven't tried to put it on her yet. She's very sensitive about her back, like she doesn't want you to look at your pet or anything, so I don't know how she would do with like a harness.
18:30:23 Yeah, but she sits at the door she watches the birds which is fun.
18:30:29 And then mostly she naps.
18:30:32 That's a good goal in life naps.
18:30:35 I'll be working and I'm like dang I wish I could nap all day instead.
18:30:39 Like, like I'm working so you can have a better life, you know.
18:30:48 Oh, you're coming back Don't touch that plant.
18:30:51 A.
18:30:55 Okay. So, let me, I'm going to kind of go a little random orders I have like those like standard questions I have to ask, and then we'll go back to your goals.
18:31:07 So on a scale of one to 10, what was your stress level this week.
18:31:19 Last weekend was really awesome and was really low stress but this work week has been pretty busy.
18:31:29 Probably like a five abridged throughout the week.
18:31:35 Okay.
18:31:37 And then, trying to think about the text messages. Which ones did you like. Which ones did stood out to you, and at any of them motivate you towards doing anything.
18:31:52 Good question. I liked the one about like grabbing some fruit, as something sweet.
18:32:04 Saturday Friday.
18:32:09 And I saw the one today.
18:32:11 Well like mindfulness and yoga.
18:32:15 I like the ones that have like a little drawings on them I think they're cute. Um,
18:32:23 I don't, I'm looking at them now I don't think any of them like inspired me to do anything.
18:32:32 Or like motivated me to change. Um, I like when you text and check in, like, How's it going, steps, you know, um, and then yeah I did, I like to the sweet treat one, I was like oh grapes.
18:32:46 Um,
18:32:47 but yeah, I think I tend to like, I get texts from like different companies and stuff and so like numbers that like want you to do something I'm just like, and so I like let them sit all day while I'm working and then like three or 4pm like I kind of
18:33:03 click through all of them. And so I feel like it's kind of gets lumped in with that as well that sometimes I'm just not like you know place to read it and process it and do something about it it's just more like up another another another notification.
18:33:27 So, yeah, no, but quick follow up question to that. Um, so we have these messages like scheduled to go out at 930 in the morning, every day.
18:33:33 Do you feel like it would have been better if we send like asked you like, when's a good time to send this message and then sent it to you at that time or do you think like because you're busy person like it's just gonna you're just going to check it,
18:33:48 or any, any variation of that.
18:33:51 Yeah, that's a good question. I think that would help because I would say like 830 would be better like before I start work or like the evening would be better ones I'm kind of winding down and like, actually, on my phone.
18:34:05 Um, I think throughout the workday like my personal stuff just kind of piles up and then I check it all at once at the end of the day, until like anything during work hours is just kind of going to get pushed aside.
18:34:19 Sorry, one second.
18:34:21 Yeah, no worries.
18:34:38 Okay, I'm so sorry, give me like one additional second, I have a roommate as, and they've entered the room so for your for your privacy just one second.
18:35:15 I'm so sorry.
18:35:20 ago, but I'm just so sorry. Okay, fine. I'm like this is why I don't have roommates.
18:35:27 Yeah.
18:35:27 I think we have, like, I'll just tell you because your friend, but like my office is upstairs. He has an office downstairs mind just happens to be in the bedroom.
18:35:41 Like, he knows the doors closed like his business time and just.
18:35:49 Anyways, so I apologize. No, you're fine. That would be a hard that up to like, like because that should be your private space but it should also be their private space and looks like and not, like, there's no common like neutral space.
18:36:03 That would be.
18:36:05 Yeah, it is. I appreciate your
18:36:09 understanding. But okay, cool. Well, I think that was helpful, and it's good feedback, because, you know, miss the pilot study and so we're trying to learn as we go.
18:36:24 And if we do end up doing that settled.
18:36:28 Again, or at a larger scale, maybe we could program it to be more specific to what the participant likes now.
18:36:36 So, going back for your health goals this week.
18:36:50 You've mentioned three already which they're all kind of like a lot.
18:36:46 Do you want to take it away, where you want me to go with this.
18:36:51 I'm wondering if three might be too many. I know normally we do to.
18:36:57 It might be doable though because two are kind of carrying over and so they're kind of already implemented like the ground works kind of been laid.
18:37:08 And I can't think of one of them that I would say like let's drop that one, you know.
18:37:15 So
18:37:19 let's start with the water one, let's, because I think that one is going to be the trickiest to track or make measurable. Um, let's start there and then see like how it all goes.
18:37:34 So, in the next week, you will drink.
18:37:41 How do you wanna, you wanna.
18:37:44 Yeah.
18:37:47 We can leave it the same, because I can guesstimate, like, how many ounces a plastic bottle is or glass, you know,
18:37:59 and the app that I'm using to track it like lets you put in different sizes like do this and so that would be fine.
18:38:11 Yeah, we can leave it the same week and leave it at like 64 ounces a day.
18:38:17 I feel like four days is still good.
18:38:21 Maybe we said five for that one I don't know.
18:38:28 Yeah, I think it's drinking it and tracking it because some days I'm like, I drink it and other days I get to the end of the day, and I'm like, Oh, I didn't track anything, trying to go back and remember and like I said drinking water is kind of mindless
18:38:41 and so then I have to be like, Oh, did I refill it today or did I not and I think Yeah.
18:38:50 Kind of makes me wish there were like a water bottle that would just like that would track it for you. Good for you, God exists, I think it's just like crazy expensive.
18:39:14 Start let's let's do a start up, let's go.
18:39:04 You know how people do like the gallon challenge, no like just chug the like and you can see it, you know,
18:39:14 trying to think I thought maybe I had another water bottle that had like markings on the sidebar I don't think I do.
18:39:21 Yeah.
18:39:23 Okay. So you'll drink 64 ounces of water in a day.
18:39:30 Do you want to do it for five days, the whole week what sounds good.
18:39:38 Um Let's do five.
18:39:45 And then, a quick kind of reflective question.
18:39:50 Did you notice like any positive effects of, you know, drinking or water or being more mindful of your water drinking.
18:40:00 Good question. Um, I'm not sure if this is appropriate for your study but I got super drunk last Friday and I didn't wake up hung over because I also drink a lot of water like that evening and the next day, and I donated blood over the weekend and I got
18:40:17 a tattoo over the weekend and like all of those things require that you're pretty hydrated and so I knew like, because I'd been drinking more water that my body was in a better shape to handle all three of those things which were like, traumatic not the
18:40:32 right word but they like affect your body pretty strongly and so knowing that like my water intake directly impacted like all three of those activities.
18:40:44 And I could like go out and have a fun time and like still feel okay like directly because of my water consumption like.
18:40:55 I felt like that was good.
18:41:00 Throughout this week, I think.
18:41:15 I think I, I feel less inclined to reach for like a sugary drink. Um, so if I'm like eating lunch at my desk instead of like pouring a glass of orange juice or grabbing like a San Pellegrino are going to gain bow by or whatever, like my waters already
18:41:26 right there and so I tend to gravitate less towards, maybe unhealthier options.
18:41:38 Yeah.
18:41:40 Cool.
18:41:41 Yeah, I think that last one is really like, Oh, that's a juicy data piece.
18:41:48 And, so, uh, I think the other thing, And I don't want to like put words in your mouth but it was really impressive to me is that this is a goal that you want to do again.
18:42:01 Like, I think that says a lot too.
18:42:05 And so, whether it be like the tattoo.
18:42:09 Or like the hangover, or because like you donated blood like all of these had really good, positive outcomes, essentially.
18:42:19 So, sorry. Okay, it's kind of funny if we picked this goal a different week like I wouldn't have had all three of those things, you know, I don't know if I would have been like, oh I I just had to pay more, you know like, because I don't feel anything
18:42:33 else I don't feel like my skin cleared up or I'm, you know, more energized or any of those things like, I think it's funny that like the way it lined up like.
18:42:43 It just happened to be really perfect timing for what I needed to do to kind of set my body up to not freak out last weekend.
18:42:52 Yeah, I think that's a good observation to, uh, what is it serendipitous.
18:43:06 Okay, so, um, would you say that this, these are the reasons as well as to like, why it's relevant for you to keep.
18:43:22 Or like, Is there another like important factor to you having this goal.
18:43:22 Um, I feel like it's mostly just like knowing that it's good for me and knowing that I haven't like mastered it yet, um, whereas like last week with the sleep goals I was kind of like, Oh, I'm good.
18:43:36 You know, I figured it out like the structure didn't really work for me but like the problem itself was solved and so like we're moving on and this one.
18:43:45 Both of them kind of feel like they're still Rocky and I like to feel like I've got something kind of firmly under control.
18:44:02 And so I think that that's kind of the biggest motivation for doing it again is just like.
18:44:02 And I kind of accomplished it but like it's not quite there yet and I know like that this is something that is good for me and that like has positive health outcomes and that even affects me like peripherally like drinking sugary beverages or, you know,
18:44:17 whatever.
18:44:20 So, Those are kind of the biggest driving factors.
18:44:24 Yeah, I like your growth mindset.
18:44:38 Okay, so I'm on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
18:44:42 I'm like an eight.
18:44:44 Like I already had a good go round of it. I was technically successful and like I just want to be more successful.
18:44:55 I'm, I'm realizing now that we didn't specify like which of the five days. Was that something that you were interested in doing.
18:45:04 I don't think so. Cuz I don't know, like it kind of just ends up working itself out like oh that I, you know went out for coffee and I got boba and I went out for drinks and so I like didn't drink as much water by drink a bunch of other stuff.
18:45:19 So I don't think I could even specify certainly Yes, um, is there anything that I can do to be supportive of this goal.
18:45:30 That's a good question. Um,
18:45:34 I think just checking in, like, even at like different times throughout the day like. How's the water thing going in here like do you refill your water bottle yet today, you know, I think a lot of it is just like forgetfulness and I'll leave the house
18:45:51 this happened like twice this week I left the house and I forgot to bring it with me. And as soon as I got in the car I was like I want water and I don't have any water.
18:46:00 So one of the times was right before my tattoo appointment and I knew I would need water and so I called my sister who I was picking up and I was like, yo, Bring me some water.
18:46:10 At the other time it was just out running errands and I just like didn't have any for a couple of hours.
18:46:16 Huh, at the other time it was just out running errands and I just like didn't have any for a couple of hours. Um, so I think like, just a reminder helps, I'm not when it's there when I'm thinking about or
18:46:27 I might even add like a reminder to my phone maybe like a 9pm like track water or drink water, because it's just, it's not that I'm not.
18:46:40 It's not I don't want to do is I just like forget.
18:46:47 Yeah.
18:46:47 So, there's a there's a couple of ways that I can.
18:46:54 Or, I guess, is it better to do like a, a text message to check in, or like, send you like a Google invite, and say like, Hey track your water, and then I can send it out the specific date.
18:47:08 Every or every day at a specific time.
18:47:13 I think the text helped more.
18:47:18 My calendars are all weird because like I use my work primarily until like even for these like zoom calls like. Sometimes they show up and sometimes they don't.
18:47:26 And so it'll just like disappear into the wasteland of my email inbox.
18:47:31 So I set myself a reminder on my phone for like 9pm every day to just like drinking track water, because that's kind of about the time when I'm like, maybe I'm tracking my meals or maybe I'm like lying in bed watching TV and it's just like the little
18:47:47 reminder that I feel like would be helpful.
18:47:50 And then yeah, you just wanted to text like.
18:47:54 However, often like and just at random times like that would be like drink your water.
18:48:02 Exactly like, I know you haven't had no water yet today.
18:48:09 If you haven't been five times you're not hydrated.
18:48:12 Drink more water. Yeah, okay.
18:48:16 So, let's.
18:48:20 I think that's a good.
18:48:22 I can definitely do that. And then for your second goal.
18:48:28 After the water thing, do you know if you want to move into the, the, the walking or the steps I mean, or the food.
18:48:43 Whichever.
18:48:46 Okay, let's go up the steps, because I feel like that one was a little solid goal. Sure, you will
18:48:54 figure out how we phrased it last time, walk.
18:49:05 Yeah, 4000 steps a day four days a week I think I'm tracking it like using my phone.
18:49:20 Okay, So, I'm, I'm curious. Is there anything that you want to do differently about this goal for example like bump it up to like 4200 or bump it up to five days or anything like that.
18:49:41 Yeah, I'm.
18:49:48 Yeah.
18:49:54 No pressure here. No, you're good.
18:50:20 Certain loud birds are the cat's leg.
18:50:10 Yeah, let's increase the step count but let's leave the days this name.
18:50:17 And I think most days I already hit 4200 so like the four days this last week were 7900 4074 4260 and 5665 so it's already like most of them are over that threshold so maybe we say like 4500.
18:50:46 Yeah and leave it at four days a week because like. Some days are just not happening.
18:50:55 And then, I'm in the same question as before, like, what, what did you notice any positive outcomes from having this goal or what's motivating you towards keeping this goal this week.
18:51:11 Yeah, I know that like days that I actually get out, um, I feel more energized than like the days when I don't leave my apartment all day, um,
18:51:25 and
18:51:27 I'm trying to think I'm like why, why do you bring my stuff so high last Friday they do when you're thirsty.
18:51:44 But anyway, I'm like I know the days when I like get, you know, triple digit steps like that I feel awful. I'm inside I think it's just like feeling better feeling more energized, feeling more productive throughout the work day like.
18:51:52 Those are the days when I end up like working at my desk right and I'm kind of doing the other things that I want to do.
18:52:00 So like yesterday for example I worked all day and then I had class and then I needed to hit these steps. So I walk she go pick something up from the neighbors.
18:52:08 And then I went to the grocery store after and like normally on a Wednesday like I wouldn't get that many things done because I would just like veg out all day and I get like 700 steps.
18:52:19 But knowing like not only that I had to hit this goal but that I like would be more productive and would feel more energized by did kind of motive me motivated me after class I laid in bed for like 15 minutes and then I was like, Okay, time to go like,
18:52:49 I get less less exactly I told my neighbor that I was coming to. And so that was the other thing and I was like there's no way I'm driving, half a mile to my neighbor's house you know when I can just
18:52:49 feel like there are a lot of factors.
18:52:51 Cool. But yeah, that was kind of the the idea.
18:52:58 The motivation surrounding it.
18:53:00 So it's really like relevant to you or relatable to you because you were able to feel more energized feel better, more productive and like do more things that you wanted to do.
18:53:14 Yeah.
18:53:15 Cool.
18:53:17 So on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level and meeting this goal.
18:53:27 I'm probably like an eight, I know I'm going up to the city this weekend so I'm like that day I'll probably get it
18:53:38 going to dinner for my sister's birthday on Tuesday and I'll be like, downtown Menlo Park so probably get it done.
18:53:46 And then like the weekend is flexible so I could definitely fit in like the farmers market or running errands or whatever, I'm good. I love the farmers.
18:53:59 So I think I'm confident I think, I think that the, the slightly increased threshold, I remember why I got so many last Thursday. My sister was here to my sisters were here, and one had to take a zoom call so the other one and I had to be out of the apartment
18:54:14 for like an hour and a half.
18:54:16 Pick up dinner in downtown Mountain View, it's like a mile away.
18:54:25 So it ended up being like an hour and a half long walk. And we got dinner at the end of it and I had blisters from my Birkenstocks from walking that far but it was good.
18:54:33 It was nice and then like to get dinner at the end of it, too, was cool so I think like having those sorts of opportunities and knowing like even tonight I need to run like just down the block it's not even 4000 steps but like to pick something up from
18:54:48 a different neighbor.
18:54:53 So I think it's attainable. I think like an eight, and I think that like saying 4500 instead of 4000 is like just challenging enough that I'll actually have to plan it and execute it rather than just kind of having it happen without too much intention
18:55:10 behind it.
18:55:13 Cool.
18:55:14 I like, I like the way you think.
18:55:18 Okay, so, um, is there anything that I can do to support this goal.
18:55:27 Um,
18:55:30 I think this one's the same just like checking in, um, it could be less frequent it could be you know a couple of times throughout the week and just being like, hey, how many days are you up to or like, I liked how you said like send me a screenshot that
18:55:58 that it was pretty high. I was like, Yes, like, I like just scraping by feels like, you know, I'm not gonna like bragging about that but like doubling him like oh yeah I can brag about that. Like just the accountability helps.
18:56:02 Just checking in.
18:56:06 So, I feel like we've made these goals like each of these goals, slightly like more challenging so with the water up to five days, and what the steps, bringing it up by 500.
18:56:24 Um, what are your thoughts about adding that third goal and I think we should do it because I'm going to do it anyway and so like, adding that level of accountability again and having like.
18:56:40 Yeah, having it like actually planned out versus just saying that I'm going to do it. I feel like will make it more attainable.
18:56:50 So, in the next week, you will, or I will, how will you like me to fill it out.
18:56:58 Yeah, um, maybe like I will stick to my meal plan, at least five of the next seven days.
18:57:12 I don't understand the Google. You heard. Oh yeah, I was like, Who is that it sounded automated like Yeah.
18:57:22 So, tell me a little bit more about your meal plan is it like breakfast, lunch and dinner, or dinner.
18:57:48 Breakfast is kind of sporadic every day for me like I'm working so I'll either order something and they're all reheat leftovers or honestly lunch is kind of sporadic for me to like today I had real breakfast but I had like hummus and pretzels for lunch.
18:57:51 Um, so yeah, it. I planned it out as lunch and dinner and I left like some space for breakfast to be kind of whatever wants to be.
18:58:01 I went to the grocery store last night and I did buy a couple of breakfast things that I'm like looking forward to having this breakfast place near my grandparents house had these really awesome breakfast sandwiches that had likes Roger mayo and grilled
18:58:20 onions on him. And I was like I can make that so I bought like throughout your mail and him hamburger buns.
18:58:27 So like that's one of the things that like all ative and truly been like knock it out, you know what I'm craving it basically.
18:58:35 So I planned out lunch and dinner and I left some spots for like leftovers and then I left like Saturday I know I'll be out with a friend so like planned on going out.
18:58:45 That evening, and then Tuesday for my sister's birthday planned on going out that evening.
18:59:01 So I plotted in some like flexibility with eating out or eating leftovers or kind of eating whatever I already kind of botched what I was going to have for lunch today, um, but like, that's okay they dinner plan today matters more for me.
18:59:05 I also like need to cook some chicken that's about to go bad in my fridge. And so I planned to cook it tonight to eat it like for lunch tomorrow, and then to make like like chicken parmesan thing with it.
18:59:20 Over the weekend, I think.
18:59:23 So like planning ahead to them not like throwing out, you know, two pounds of chicken.
18:59:33 Um, okay.
18:59:35 So, um, the way that we're going to measure this, how do you want to measure this.
18:59:41 So I've got it written down it's like on like account like a weekly planner sheet, and I was just gonna like check them off, honestly, um, so just being like, it's two meals a day, times the next seven days basically so
18:59:58 like I'll stick to 10 of the meals, and really just like checklist in it off so I was gonna probably magnet it to my fridge or something and it's very manual it's like pen and paper.
19:00:13 Okay.
19:00:14 The other thing I was thinking of, because I know you mentioned like sending the photos or like me asking for the photos.
19:00:22 You can say like, you can text me like a photo of the meal that you made, or eat.
19:00:30 For example like you know you're making the chicken tonight so you'll be like, this is the chicken or actually, it might be make make more sense if you send it to me like before you did.
19:00:39 Yeah.
19:00:41 Like, this is my empty plate, but it was, it was a meal off the meal plan. Yeah.
19:00:48 Sorry. No.
19:00:50 That sounds like a good idea.
19:00:53 Okay.
19:00:53 Um, the other thing I was going to suggest is you can send me a photo of your meal plan to so that way I can be like hey, you were planning on eating this time.
19:01:05 You looking over your sandwich. Yeah, something like that.
19:01:10 Yeah, that works right now but awesome.
19:01:16 Okay. And so it's attainable.
19:01:19 And we're measuring it.
19:01:22 And then the relevant piece, just some things that you highlighted in the beginning, or like not wanting to be wasteful.
19:01:33 Running has written in it.
19:01:35 Yeah.
19:01:37 Um, what, what are other reasons, or why is this important to you.
19:01:43 Yeah. One of the things I'm making this week is like knock off chick fil a sandwiches. So like, not spending money at chick fil a is important to me.
19:01:52 So I'm like I need to eat this chicken.
19:01:55 There's no really ideal way I'm looking forward to eating this chicken like I'm not craving like chicken and vegetables or whatever but I was like if I could make it like, not necessarily fun but like something that I crave and not give cheerfully my
19:02:13 money like, that's kind of it, to, like, Two birds one stone.
19:02:22 Um, yeah. Money is a factor in some of it's like money I already spent so like I already spent all this money on like the Hello Fresh kit and groceries and so to throw it out would be a waste of that money but also to order delivery, out of my own pocket
19:02:37 for the next week would be a waste of my money.
19:02:47 Yeah. And just to kind of make better use of my time I think like right now I told myself like oh I don't have time to cook and after work I'm like I just want to crawl into bed and watch TV but if I'm looking at in I'm like oh I'm just going to take
19:03:01 20 minutes to prep this and pop it in the oven or
19:03:08 whatever. I need to make like next week for example I need to make a lasagna for an event anyway and so I was going to like make one to give and then like make myself a small one like for my own dinner on Monday.
19:03:22 So like two birds one stone, really. So, time management money management,
19:03:30 not being wasteful.
19:03:38 I think, time management and money management are really relevant to health, but was wood cooking at home or following your meal plan benefit you and other ways health wise.
19:03:53 Yeah, that's a good question. I think so I think it's just like healthier alternatives so like I said with this sandwich that I'm craving like if I make it at home it's probably like four or five 600 calories if I go out and buy it, it's probably like,
19:04:07 eight, nine, 1000 calories.
19:04:14 Same with several of these like the chick fil a sandwich you know I'm like, I'm going to coat it with like milk, eggs and flour and then put in the air fryer instead of like deep frying it healthier.
19:04:29 So like the cooking styles, different to.
19:04:33 Yeah, Yeah, I'm more control maybe.
19:04:38 Definitely, yeah more control on.
19:04:45 I like cooking to I think it's like it's a.
19:04:50 I don't know if soothing is the right word but it's like something that I enjoy doing and I know that I enjoy doing it, even when I'm like trying to avoid doing it because I'm tired.
19:05:00 And so I know it makes me feel like happy, or good or whatever. I'm cleaning up not so much so I'm like kind of dreading that but that's okay. Um, so yeah i think i think it has health benefits I think that those matter but I don't think that they're
19:05:18 like the primary motivators here, especially like this week.
19:05:25 Yeah, I think it's good to be mindful of that and also, we'll check in next week to see like, like just a reflection of it essentially. Yeah.
19:05:36 Okay, so sorry my scale question is coming back on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
19:05:48 Um.
19:05:56 The one thing I was gonna say was like, there are some days when I might mix it up like I might eat tomorrow's dinner today and Today's dinner tomorrow and I want to like kind of give myself the space to do that without like saying that I failed, you
19:06:04 know, so I'm looking at it more holistically more like 10 of these meals out of the next 14 unless of like one of the next one to out the next to you know.
19:06:17 And so I think like With that in mind, that I'm pretty confident like probably a seven, that if I felt like I was trapped in by it. I think that would make it more difficult because I would say like, oh man, I'm really supposed to cook that steak tonight
19:06:34 but I really really just want sushi, you know, whereas if I said like, Oh, I can cook the steak tomorrow and just have leftovers today like that that would make it a little bit more attainable and give me a little bit more control and flexibility so,
19:06:52 yeah, so I'll change the goal to say like in the next week you will follow your meal plan board 10 meals out of 14 meals. Yeah.
19:07:04 Okay, it's worded a little differently but will know what we mean. Yeah.
19:07:09 Okay, cool.
19:07:11 Um, and then is Was there anything I can do to support this goal.
19:07:16 I think you already mentioned them so just like I can send pictures, you can.
19:07:25 Yeah, just checking in, positive feedback like those sorts of things. So,
19:07:42 um, so I will send you a message with all of these are an email with all of these. Um, and then I'll check in with you later.
19:07:47 One question that's related to next week's appointment.
19:07:53 I'm not available on Thursday, I like accidentally mess up my schedule. And so I was gonna see if you were available either Wednesday, or Friday.
19:08:07 Both are rough on Wednesday I have class. So it's just kind of always a struggle and then Friday I have an early morning flight, and they'll be with my family all day.
19:08:20 So, I couldn't hear return.
19:08:23 Monday.
19:08:24 Monday early morning, would you want to do Monday evening.
19:08:33 I could Yeah, I could do, like, early evening I typically have a call with my therapist at 730 so I could do like the five or six o'clock hours.
19:08:45 Okay. Yeah, let's go.
19:08:49 515 be okay. Yeah. On May, 3. Yeah.
19:08:56 Um, I think it might like mess up your text message schedule a little bit, but I don't think we're like too far off like your text messages my end on Sunday and then we would meet Monday.
19:09:07 Okay, or some, something like that, something to that effect. Yeah, no problem.
19:09:13 So, I'll send you this.
19:09:17 And hopefully you do get notified to your email.
19:09:21 Yeah, yeah, hopefully, we'll see.
19:09:31 Cool as the same zoom link anyway right. Totally.
19:09:32 Just copy that from today's just in case.
19:09:40 Well, thank you for meeting with me, and I hope you have a good week. Good luck with your health goals drink a lot of water, and I will see you next month.
19:09:53 Next, next Monday. Yeah, like 10 days from now.
19:09:56 Yeah.
