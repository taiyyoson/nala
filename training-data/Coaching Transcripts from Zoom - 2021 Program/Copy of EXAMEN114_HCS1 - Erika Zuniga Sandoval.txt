11:58:18 Hello.
12:03:16 Try again.
12:06:25 Your message for 508303, for sorry that mailbox is full.
12:09:28 Hi Jennifer This is Erica
12:09:33 guys sorry about the delay.
12:09:45 Okay. And actually we have the Google number that maybe Susan us to reach you and I'm trying to use it, but it keeps giving me.
12:09:56 Try the call again so I think something's not linked to my account that's not letting it work but I've used it before, then maybe because I haven't used it in a while.
12:10:05 It's not.
12:10:07 It's not recognizing my phone as a user.
12:10:10 So my goal I'll call her from myself but I'll have bucket so it doesn't feel.
12:10:19 Because I think I'm also not supposed to use my cell phone.
12:10:22 For safety privacy and, you know, research protocols, as we call it.
12:10:28 Yeah of course yeah I mean it's because I don't know if I told you in the email but I'm in the process of moving so I got internet I think because it's like a new place, maybe they didn't conduct a very well.
12:10:40 So that's why I think the fight has been a little unstable lately so I need to kind of get that fixed.
12:10:47 But thank you for for calling. No, no, no worries and thank you so much for making time in your schedule as I know you're, you have a lot of things going on like moving.
12:10:58 And that takes a while to all get settled in.
12:11:00 So let's, let's get started. And as I mentioned, my name is Erica.
12:11:06 So I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks. And I want to give you just a quick introduction, and then transition into talking about goals and, and the health goals that you might have for this upcoming week how does that sound.
12:11:21 Yeah, that sounds great.
12:11:23 Thank you.
12:11:25 So first, as you've noticed examine is sort of a two part intervention.
12:11:29 One aspect of it is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving.
12:11:35 You have been receiving those. Yes, yes. Yeah. And the second part is the health coaching. So my role as your health coaches to meet with you once a week.
12:11:46 And that's, you know, we can do that through soon or over the phone. The goal is to do at least 20 minutes.
12:11:54 And during this time we can check in about the daily text messages what has been your thoughts on those any goals that you have related to health and wellness.
12:12:05 I'll also be asking you about stress level and how you're feeling about stress.
12:12:12 In this last week.
12:12:13 And then we'll also go over just any other questions that you have. During the week, I'll check in with you to see how your progress is going.
12:12:23 And if you have any questions or topics that come up during our sessions that I feel might be outside of my scope of work or expertise as your health coach, and I will let you know what those limitations are and also connect you with appropriate resources.
12:12:40 So this as you know this is a research study and we hope that we're able to collect a lot of useful data however any specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data that we gather will be sort of more aggregate data and de identified.
12:12:57 So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing with us, or with me because it's just for today.
12:13:06 By the end of the four weeks.
12:13:08 We hope that you gain skills are our problem solving and goal setting, as a way to help you manage any physical health goals, maybe spiritual or mental health goals that you also have.
12:13:22 So we really want to thank you for choosing to participate in this program and we really hope that this program itself is going to help us to be able to figure out what are the needs of your students and how we can provide them resources that can really
12:13:36 benefit so it's going to benefit at summit, because it can help us to provide this as a larger at a larger scale.
12:13:44 Do you have questions before we get started.
12:13:51 No, I think I'll probably have questions as we go.
12:13:55 And I think so far no.
12:13:59 Perfect.
12:13:59 And so in thinking about today.
12:14:02 What are some of the things that you're hoping to check in about and thinking of that too. I do want you to tell me a little bit more about yourself and sort of what, what brings you in what interested you about the program, and among that are within
12:14:18 that, what are you hoping to check in about, what do you want to focus on.
12:14:24 What do you hope to gain from your sessions.
12:14:28 Yeah, I mean I think overall it's just like a perfect timing because I've been kind of having a little bit of like breathing problems that kind of, I wouldn't say heart problems because I haven't like a fish he caught and tested but you know I've been
12:14:54 like to the hospital sometimes and that kind of just made me realize that every time that I drink like any sugary drinks or that I eat. You know something that's like super spicy or that's not as healthy as I would hope it to be then I, my heart like
12:15:01 just increases a little bit so the doctors have. In the meantime, that I get tested and all that they like kind of told me to stay away from any sugary drinks or you know those things and I think for me, I love like sugary drinks and kind of snacks and
12:15:20 things like that. So, I think I had to kind of take a step back and look at my stress levels, and also kind of my eating habits and then I need to make better choices are eating habits and then now that I kind of moved the big component of.
12:15:39 I think that I can eat healthier now because I'm going to have to be cooking all the time and you know I can do like food prep or something like that and I think just the overall experience of moving out it's like exciting.
12:15:51 So I'm thinking like this could be kind of a start to me eating a little healthier, and just having a better, healthier living style then I kind of was before.
12:16:03 Because, you know, it kind of has caused a little problem here and there. So, I think, just like perfect style but that's kind of just some of my thoughts that I've been kind of thinking about.
12:16:15 Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing. I think you brought up a lot of great areas that we can work on.
12:16:21 You mentioned, make money to make changes in the way that you eat making better choices you mentioned food prep.
12:16:29 You also brought up looking at your stress level. So let me ask you a little bit more about that. For this last week on a scale of one to 10, one being not so stress, and 10 being very stressed, what was your stress level for this week.
12:16:47 This week if I have to pick your ugly.
12:16:51 I wouldn't say like and she just because of the whole like moving and then also work in schools I think it's been pretty on the higher.
12:16:59 Yeah, you have a lot going on as well, and remind me What year are you in school.
12:17:06 This is my second year in my master's program. Okay. Yeah, so there's definitely a lot going on this semester is almost coming to an end.
12:17:16 Definitely lots and lots going on.
12:17:19 So in the past.
12:17:22 When you set your goals so whether they're around health or wellness.
12:17:27 How would you say that you've done in meeting those goals so let's say if you also have to rate your progress for that. On a scale of one so great and 10.
12:17:38 Great.
12:17:41 And this is just for overall. Yeah, kind of like held up to today I guess to give us like a baseline of where are you today and meeting your goals.
12:17:53 Oh, I guess I would say like, I'm in the middle like probably a five.
12:18:00 Yeah, so I think once I kind of set my goals like I know that I can try and push them but recently have been really taking care of myself so I think that kind of just puts me a little.
12:18:13 I think you bring up a great point that once we set goals if we make them very specific, measurable, attainable, it can really help us to to move them forward and that's actually one of the main things that we cover on session one when we meet with with
12:18:31 you today. I keep saying we because I am part of a team and I think I'm just used to it. I'm sorry.
12:18:39 No, no, okay, as long as we're meeting today. I think that's something that it's important that we discuss the setting goals.
12:18:47 So what are your health goals that you have in mind for this upcoming week, and how can we measure progress.
12:19:08 Thinking also about why is this goal important to you.
12:19:02 I think it's good for us to think about all those things. Is there something that you want to get started with for this upcoming week.
12:19:26 Yeah, I think, drinking water. I think I've kind of been, you know, not really. Drinking as much water as I
12:19:23 told you in the beginning but I like more or less sugary drinks.
12:19:27 But I think something that I really need to focus on this week, not only because like my doctors told me but because, you know, every time I drink sugary drinks, then I kind of my heart rate starts racing so I'm thinking like drink more water.
12:19:44 This week, and staying away from any sweets, that I that I can, because I especially when I'm at work. There's a lot of like snacks and candy and I'm like oh there's a snack or there's the candy like when we get one.
12:19:59 So I think I need to kind of be better on saying no and drinking water I don't know if that would be like an appropriate goal but that's just something that comes up.
12:20:09 I think that's a perfect goal to start with. And now let's work on making it more specific and measurable. So when you tell me like I want to drink water how much water Are you thinking in terms of maybe ounces bottles.
12:20:26 Do you have something that you carry with you that will help you remember to take to drink water.
12:20:33 What are your thoughts about that.
12:20:35 Yeah, I used to carry a water bottle.
12:20:51 Not anymore but I think if I had to see something like very specific I would say, like a start would be maybe three water bottles, like from those that you find like a stork lead, I have a bunch here at my house.
12:20:53 So I think I would start with probably like three days, new enough like yeah that's healthy, but I think.
12:21:11 Yeah. In thinking about where you are today, and where you want to move forward. I would, I would just say don't think about what is recommended or what is healthy, think about what is feasible for you to start with, and gradually add a little bit more,
12:21:21 because that's what's going to make you successful.
12:21:26 To set up yourself.
12:21:28 You want to set yourself up to succeed in your goal so I would say if right now, you're not drinking any water. Let's say you're, you're, or maybe you're drinking one water bottle a day, then adding two more and having three water bottles, that's great
12:21:43 process progress.
12:21:46 It's more than what you had before.
12:21:49 Yeah.
12:21:52 Like, I don't mind.
12:22:08 Yeah, and we'll work on that. So it seemed to your thinking three bucks water bottles a day. And when you say the ones that the store, I think there's different sizes so are you thinking more the 16 ounce one.
12:22:10 I think so I can also check.
12:22:24 Oh yeah, it's the 16.9 ounces, to your dream, 316, point, nine ounces of water a
12:22:40 day me
12:22:43 thinking, and how long you remind yourself to do this.
12:22:51 Um, I guess I'll just, kind of, since I work from home I'll have those water bottles like on my desk and just kind of drink them consistently and maybe I'm thinking like by a certain time today if I have to drink water I can always put a reminder on my
12:23:11 phone to just start drinking more water I don't know if that would be something.
12:23:21 Setting a reminder on your phone thing that's a good idea.
12:23:27 Sometimes, I find it really useful to associate it with something else that I do. So for example, if every morning I'm eating something, then maybe have at least part of it in the morning, like when you're eating right, either before or after you eat.
12:23:46 And let's say around noon, you're also eating something, then have a little bit more either before or after your, your meal.
12:23:57 That could be something else that could help you.
12:24:07 The idea of associating it with, with a with a meal or, or snack.
12:24:17 Okay. Yeah, that kind of helps I think when I decide to drink water during one of my nails I finished the whole thing and like that meal.
12:24:28 So think about things that you are doing that are working. And how can something be like added to it to just make it a little bit easier I would say and more comfortable.
12:24:41 I also wanted to ask how many days during the week do you want to be able to do this, what do you think will be feasible to start with.
12:24:51 Um, I think I would take three days would be good, because I do tend to drink water like there without even just kind of actually having end of the pool.
12:25:03 But obviously not as much as I hope I did so I think maybe if I can start with three days that would be awesome.
12:25:15 And what would you say is your confidence level about being able to achieve your goal.
12:25:22 On a scale of one that's a confident and 10, very confident.
12:25:29 Um, I would say probably like a seven.
12:25:33 Very good. Very good.
12:25:41 That's a great goal to start with, is there something else that you wanted to include or do you think for this week one goal will be a good start and then next week we can revisit adding something else or improving upon the one that you're making for
12:25:59 today.
12:26:02 Yeah, I think one was like me hands like a bunch of calls, but I think just being realistic with myself that I'm in the process of moving and everything I think one, you know one goal could be attainable if I really just want to focus on on doing and
12:26:17 completing those three days.
12:26:24 I be good.
12:26:24 Be good. And I fully agree. I think especially in thinking of everything that you have going on. Setting at least one goal is, is very generous and to start with.
12:26:37 Yes, yes.
12:26:37 Any other thoughts you want to share around, for example, what have been your successes in the past when you've tried to work on your house or what have been some of the challenges that you faced
12:26:50 like about like my, my goals. When you set up health goals.
12:26:59 Um, yeah I guess like starting with the positive like I kind of have set myself before where, you know, I start exercising, and I start eating better like I've tried doing meal prep for a while, and this was like maybe four years ago that I do remember
12:27:22 that I was like, I'm pretty healthy in the way that I would go to the gym very often or just even do some sort of exercising. And then also, just kind of like eating healthier.
12:27:36 And that just kind of not only kind of looked a little healthier but also a little hook here. And I think part of part of it that I had kind of some friends to go with and then now with, you know, co bit I kind of totally forgot to do the even exercise
12:27:55 or do all that. And I've been, you know, just being honest I pleasing, and then kind of just been some positives where I knew, I kind of worked for me, and then I felt healthier.
12:28:13 And the other part of it that you asked was, what hasn't worked for me right.
12:28:26 I think just liking, some sort of food.
12:28:23 More than I should like I love soda, and has always been like my thing. Since I was a child.
12:28:31 Like I just love Cogan.
12:28:34 Like I just love coke and that's one of the worst thing that you can drink so every time I go to like a restaurant, I would order like a soda or sometimes if we try not to have soda, at the house just because you know be drinking in every meal but like
12:28:48 like when we to have a party or we do end up getting like having a soda, I'll always drink that and I'll pick up, always overwater. So I feel like that has been kind of like an always situation where it's like, Oh, where is like the soda, and then kind
12:29:08 just, I guess kind of going back to, preferring like like not healthy choices like if I were to be like a party with her like salads and then there's like other like foods like I rather I rather eat the other food versus like eating like salad or, you
12:29:28 know, little healthier I think that kind of has, you know, I feel, especially with coven. Now I've just been trying to.
12:29:39 I think I feel like I just choose the unhealthy option more than the healthy option.
12:29:47 Sometimes is just what's available but also mentioned just that we are inclined to make certain choices over others, and at times, I mean, all that I think all the things that you mentioned are really related to just the habits that we developed over
12:30:06 time, right, if, if, for example, so it has been something that's been part of your life since I was a child trying to change that all of a sudden it's going to take some time.
12:30:19 And also the idea that there's there's healthy foods, and there's also foods that we should have in moderation.
12:30:29 I that's how I like to think about it so that we don't create this idea of these foods are like bad for me.
12:30:37 They're just not as beneficial is just for them. Right.
12:30:42 Yeah. So, I think you bring up a great, great points about the things that you want to work on.
12:30:49 So I'm, I'll make some notes so that as we move forward in the next sessions, we could think of, do you want to set a goal around. For example, working on, and I think you're already doing that drinking more water, which can work to, you know, substitute
12:31:06 some other soda intake.
12:31:09 at least for part of the time, right.
12:31:12 I want to make sure that you also think about how can you still enjoy the things that that you like to eat.
12:31:18 But as I mentioned in moderation, right, because those are the things that either bring new memories or make you happy. And you want to be able to have those in your life as well.
12:31:31 Just maybe a smaller versions of it.
12:31:38 Yeah.
12:31:38 Yeah. No, I think that's.
12:31:42 Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. I guess like I always kind of try and make myself feel bad like oh this is not healthy it's not healthy and I think you're writing it's about moderation how much you're actually having
12:31:57 portion sizes.
12:32:02 A lot of a lot of different things that we definitely need to consider.
12:32:05 So let me ask you a little bit about the messages that you've received so far. So, so far you've been getting daily text messages, I think you should have gotten at least a few informative ones by now because today's Tuesday, or you just started getting
12:32:23 Oh, you just started getting them on Saturday. That's correct. So, what happened your thoughts so far.
12:32:30 On the messages that you've received. And if you felt that you haven't gotten enough to really evaluate them no no worries, you'll be getting a lot more every single day.
12:32:40 And you can always tell me more about them next week to.
12:32:45 Yeah, yeah I boy then like I think you know that type of person that I'm like, I will open an app you know like there's sometimes like an app. There, they give you like daily affirmations are like boats and things like that but we're not really like that
12:33:02 type of person to open an app, and like read the quote of the day or something but this makes it easy because it's like a text message that I you know I read all my text messages so kind of gives me that ability to just open it up and actually like read
12:33:16 it. So that has been helpful. And then like the, you know, just the text message that I would feel like I think they're good I think I received like a couple that I really liked it I think it was like a picture like some food in the background and then
12:33:34 there was like a written out that I really liked.
12:33:39 So yeah, I think I enjoy just that message.
12:33:54 I was trying to open, where I can see the messages that you receive. And I thought maybe that disconnected as, you know, I was just my moment of freaking out, trying to figure out the message that, that you were referring to.
12:34:16 That was the one that said like Sobieski, and then just like,
12:34:21 like a fun fact I think.
12:34:24 And then it was a message that I got this morning. It was this Saturday yes good eating healthy, exercise, and being a healthy way can add seven years to your life and you can cut your risk of type two diabetes and have
12:34:41 stood out to you.
12:34:42 Yeah, I think it's just, you know, for me like more pictures, personally.
12:34:50 The other messages that I've ever seen.
12:34:52 But I think, you know, for me, I've always kind of liked pictures a little better.
12:34:58 That's very good feedback it'll help us to consider for the future messaging Do you want to make them all more photo like or similar to the one that you got on Monday, less, less text the text.
12:35:16 So, No that's that's very good.
12:35:19 That's good.
12:35:21 It helps us to move forward.
12:35:24 Okay, any other items that you wanted to check in with me today, or bring up.
12:35:33 No, I think.
12:35:37 I think that's it.
12:35:38 So far, I think.
12:35:39 Yeah.
12:35:42 So I'll let you, I'll give you a quick summary about what we discussed today, and send it via email. So typically at the after the end of our session, I'll type up some notes about our session, send you an email with with your goal for the week.
12:36:02 And I'll add some resources about water.
12:36:07 I know there's, for example, if it's difficult to drink plain water, you might be able to add fruit to it.
12:36:14 But real fruit, like cut out for or some Romans license or cucumber so I'll try to find some resources to so that we can be fun and interactive for you in that way.
12:36:27 But I think you've set great goals for the first week, and as I said I'll send you a little summary with your goal any resources that I can find. And I will be following up with you during the week to see how you're doing with your goal of drinking water.
12:36:46 The other part is ideally we want to meet once a week. So I wanted to ask if Tuesdays at noon are good time for us to meet weekly, or did you want to look at a different time or different day of the week.
12:37:01 Yeah, let me.
12:37:03 Yeah, I think that could work.
12:37:07 Thursday.
12:37:08 Today, we couldn't do through zoom but workout.
12:37:14 And I will send you a calendar invite for the first session two three and four.
12:37:21 If at any time, be other sessions or conflict with anything that concept, just let me know. and we can figure out an alternate day.
12:37:31 Okay.
12:37:32 Okay, perfect.
12:37:35 See, that's all I have for you today.
12:37:38 Unless you have any questions for me.
12:37:42 And I think I guess the text messaging that that I get it from you is if some someone else.
12:37:51 So the text messages are through an automated platform that we created.
12:37:57 So our team developed the messages.
12:38:01 Our research team, and they're automatically being sent to you and to the rest of the people that are participating in the program.
12:38:10 However, I send you and visual messages to through the platform.
12:38:15 So for example today when I said, are looking forward to meeting you today at noon that was.
12:38:22 Sometimes I signed them with my name just so that you know that it is me.
12:38:27 But there's a certain number of characters are allowed to use. And so, I don't have a number for that.
12:38:34 But if you ever respond to messages, I get to see it directly, it comes to to me.
12:38:42 Got it, okay, I just wanted to make sure on that sound like texting someone. No, no, you're done you reply, it comes to me.
12:38:53 Got it, okay, that's that's helpful to know. Yeah, I think that was my only question for now.
12:39:03 So I will see you next Tuesday I know, and it was a pleasure to meet you.
12:39:09 Yeah. It was nice meeting and thank you so much for the call.
12:39:14 Thank you. Have a great rest of your day back to it.
