17:58:50 Hello, how are you today.
17:58:54 Good.
17:58:57 It's almost the middle of the week so we're getting there we're getting there. That's my last day classes today so how are you feeling overwhelmed.
17:59:09 My first finals. On Monday, so that a study.
17:59:14 So there's a lot coming up this this week, volunteer day is also our last coaching session. So towards the end of today and after we go over sort of how things work for the week, I'll give you a bit more information about what are some of the next steps
17:59:29 now that that you've completed the four sessions with me, and I believe that text messages will end sometime this weekend to just them.
17:59:41 And, I mean, you'll have them on your phone they won't disappear but you will be getting numerous ones, right.
17:59:49 So how did you do on on meeting your goals this last week. Yet, meditation, and taking breaks.
17:59:59 I did okay and Okay, um, I don't think I quite met the five day goal but I did, I did do it on.
18:00:11 You know I've been, I've been doing it I have been making it a practice to set aside time to meditate, and then, and then taking time between classes to just relax and it was strange too because I might have did the five days honestly I didn't really
18:00:28 track it, but it was strange because it's just like,
18:00:35 allowing myself to take like even just the 15 minutes was just like, more stressful than I thought it was going to be. Because, and you know just, and I never really considered myself a busy body but I guess I am because I just was like, you know, I should
18:00:55 be doing this like there's so much stuff that I need to get done like what am I doing just sitting here like I have, you know, I was so mad at my mom growing up, could choose that way to like she wouldn't be able to focus unless the house was like a certain
18:01:04 way and then now I'm reading into that tree and myself and so and and sort of turning off our mind, sometimes it's actually more and more difficult and we then we realized I mean, especially because you do have quite a few things you want to get done.
18:01:30 But knowing that you need to give your mind that that mental break it's really important to. So, on a scale of one to 10.
18:01:40 Very great. How did you think you did with your goal this last week.
18:01:43 I would say like an eight. Okay.
18:01:49 I was like right there like if it wasn't five all five days is like four of the more than five days.
18:01:55 That's good.
18:01:57 And.
18:01:57 And how about stress wise, how would you say your stress level was This Week on a scale of one, not so stress and stress. I mean, this week isn't very, like, you're good indicator just because it's the last week of classes, you know, but I would say probably
18:02:15 about like a six. Yeah, it's definitely a different type of situation.
18:02:23 But it all averages out right once we see it all together. So, right.
18:02:30 So you were able to do most days for the meditation and taking that that mental break, and what are you hoping to be able to check in about today, and also thinking about the fact that today would be the last coaching session and how can we create either
18:02:49 a goal or think about skills that you will continue to use, moving forward to help you manage your health and your wealth be.
18:03:00 Honestly, I don't know I didn't I wasn't expecting, since it was our last session I wasn't thinking about what goals I wanted to set after this I was more thinking about just like keeping the consistency and trying to continue some, like the habits that
18:03:16 I've developed like I really like the variety in my diet like adding more things in, you know, coming up with different ways to put more fruits and vegetables into my diet.
18:03:30 And then, the harder ones is, you know, cutting down on the takeout.
18:03:38 But I've already like started to try and work on that so like Tuesdays and I'm not going to have the problem anymore because I'm not in class but like Tuesdays and Thursdays when I would have later classes I would on Tuesdays I would make lasagna.
18:03:54 Earlier in the day and then it can just be put in the oven. And I even added and this is, it's actually pretty good if you want to try it and I mixed in, spinach, with the me.
18:04:07 So, added vegetables to the meal, and I didn't have to worry about making a side or anything to. So it's just put a lot of spinach in with the me and then, and then everything else was like normal.
18:04:21 And that worked out really well.
18:04:24 And then just finding different like slow cooker meals for days when I know I'm going to be busy was nice like I did.
18:04:35 Campbell's Soup cuz I was like these sauce.
18:04:42 Like, I know packages if you want to call it there they're like, they're easy slow cooker meals, and does like the sauce comes in like this little pouch and you just add the meat so you just put the meat in your slow cooker and the meat and vegetables
18:04:59 if it pulls your vegetables and then you just put this Austin and that's it.
18:05:04 Or they have one pan meals which I did occur like they have like Thai chicken curry which I'm not that confident in my own cooking skills so to be able to just have them back and put in, and then just add the rice and then I was like, Well how do I add
18:05:21 a vegetables. This was not just me and.
18:05:24 So, you know, I put peas in with the, with the rice and stuff so that it was a little bit more variety and, yeah, I really like that I like coming up with ways to add variety to diet so that things are a little bit more balance.
18:05:40 And I'm noticing improvement in.
18:05:42 I don't know if this is coincidental but I'm going to say it's conversational that my skin has really improved. And so, I yeah I've noticed like my, my face has been a lot smoother.
18:05:56 And so, in texture and I was like whoa, that's kind of like I don't know if that's from, like, my skin regime but I haven't really changed it but my diet has changed and so I think that that's affecting my skin, which is cool.
18:06:10 I like that.
18:06:15 Those are definitely like the good side effects that are you on, right.
18:06:20 So I know that you mentioned that and coming to this today's session you really didn't think about goals that that you could set but it does sound like you want to be able to continue working on the goals that you've set throughout the previous previous
18:06:35 weeks. Yeah, just continue the good habits that have started to form.
18:06:40 Okay, yeah, I can still send you back a summary email with all the goals that you had set for yourself in the past, sort of, so you have them all in one.
18:06:49 In one email. I think that that might be helpful too
18:06:56 think the only thing that I would add is maybe I'd like more stretching, you today.
18:07:04 And I just say that and I don't know, I don't know how much I trust this doctor, which I know sounds weird, but like I had a ganglion cyst in my wrist, a bad one.
18:07:15 And it had been there for like nine months and I went to a doctor and he straight up told me.
18:07:22 I can't drain it yet because it's not big enough or hard enough, but it'll either go away on its own or it'll get bigger and you can come back in and get a drink.
18:07:31 Well, it didn't either of those things, none of those things I didn't get bigger didn't get harder, it still hurt so it wasn't going away. So I went to this other doctor that I didn't really want to go see but I didn't want to go through the process of
18:07:45 getting a new primary care doctor and then getting a referral from that primary care doctor. I had already been seeing this doctor in San Francisco, and this was the guy that he referred to for hand stuff and I already had seen him before because of my,
18:07:59 I have cubicle tunnel syndrome.
18:08:04 Really.
18:08:04 No one seems to know what it is. Anyway, the doctor says carpal tunnel the physical therapist says cubicle tunnel the guy at the, the this doctor you kiss me out because you just want me to stretch more like that's gonna fix it and I'm like
18:08:22 yes okay yes stretching is going to make this go away that I've had for years and years. But anyway, same kind of thing happened when I went in again was with this system was he's like oh well this is your body trying to say that, you know, straight you've
18:08:38 been stretching a little bit more, but it's not enough and so this is like your body's check engine light turning on and I was like, I don't know about that and then he really, really made me angry.
18:08:55 Because the audacity like I know I'm not a super skinny person. Um, but he told me that you know one thing I should work on is the mileage of my day like start if I'm going for walks, go on longer walks if I'm working out workout for longer and I'm like
18:09:06 dude I work out for an hour a day five to six days a week, like I work how Oh hot. Mom, like just because I don't exist in a skinny body doesn't mean that I'm not, not in active and I really hated that.
18:09:23 And then he said, that
18:09:30 basically i'd needed to be stretching and stretching and but length is what I need. So, I'll give it a shot like he makes me mad but I mean it's not gonna hurt me to be stretching more.
18:09:41 Yes, and I mean it sounds like the experience that you had is, it's just a person that has a very set idea of what people should look like and not necessarily about, like, it doesn't even have to be.
18:09:55 He has a certain idea of what health looks like he's still the hand doctor. Why is he talking to me about my, like, No, I'm so sorry that you had to go through that.
18:10:08 Oh, it just made me mad and I was like I were like I am very physically fit. I work out a lot. It's how I cope with stuff like I enjoy it so I do it and I go for walks and.
18:10:25 And he said, um, and he's like well you know you can just add mileage to the day and I was like okay but when is working out too much. And it's like, that's doesn't exist.
18:10:36 He goes bang doesn't exist, you know, it's all it is if you work out too much you just need length and stretching and then, and then it'll go down you'll get stronger and then you can go even longer and I'm like, Dude, athletes get injuries because they
18:10:51 overdo it.
18:10:54 I created this person did
18:10:58 that but instruction is not a bad thing just because it's coming from an annoying person so stretching is probably.
18:11:07 So in thinking about stretching. How much time do you think would be ideal to start with, like, five minutes.
18:11:16 How many days during those
18:11:21 five.
18:11:24 five days.
18:11:24 Is this something that you want to do in the morning and the afternoon. In the evening, about that.
18:11:35 Think about that.
18:11:38 Yeah. Help me up.
18:11:39 Yeah, I think of it as as the morning stretch right.
18:11:44 Good morning, after being in bed for a while, the bloody needs.
18:11:49 waking up.
18:11:52 And how confident, do you feel about being able to do this.
18:11:56 Like I could do it like, look at me like yeah I could do that. Sure.
18:12:15 Okay, um, particularly adductor stretches, um, because I did have the. So the first doctor that I went to this that he couldn't drink my sister quite yet.
18:12:30 I did see him her knee pain.
18:12:34 And because I was having knee pain, when I was sedentary for too long.
18:12:39 aching pain and it was horrible because sitting in lecture halls for an hour to two hours it was agonizing, as I was like okay something's wrong like I've been putting up with this for too long.
18:12:49 I'm going to go to the doctor figure out what's going on.
18:12:52 And, and he kind of narrowed it down to like it's mild facial kind of imbalance, like my doctors were way way way too tight and so it was pulling my kneecap out of the alignment that I needed to be in and so I went to physical therapy to work on my adductor
18:13:11 strength, and that was kind of how also kind of jump started a lot of my fitness was working on my adductor stuff, and then also strengthening my hips because he said that would really help as well.
18:13:24 And so, like, good adductor stretches since that those tend to get tight on me, I guess, so I can maintain that would be fantastic also hip stretches.
18:13:40 Yeah, the hips are important especially, and I know, I know you're very young, but as women and as we get older, and I think hips are like super important to maintain just for blocking purpose.
18:13:50 I don't know if you've ever seen this but have you ever seen, like older folks that when they walk they don't like step anymore that kind of shuffle. And that has to do with like our flexibility in in our joints and our hips.
18:14:04 So just thinking about that really early on. It's really important.
18:14:09 I work a lot with, with an older population for fall prevention and they'll say a lot of the things that we've talked about and we work in a memory care facility in Canfield.
18:14:25 Whereas can kill.
18:14:27 It's in the North Bay it's and Marin area it's like by, you know quarter Madeira or San Rafael. Okay, Ben and Selma, okay, not quite like north of Sausalito.
18:14:47 Okay.
18:15:00 Sounds familiar. That's right around there. It's cute. Tiny you blink, and you're out of the town.
18:14:57 Small Town.
18:14:57 I'll find some
18:15:06 can be good. I should be able to find some fun stuff.
18:15:11 Do you have any exercise apps.
18:15:14 Well yeah, I worked out with the apple fitness plus.
18:15:37 I wonder if they have any stretching, they have like the mindful cool downs which does do stretching and I do that after every workout. And that's why I said like I do many meditations because they have like the tune, like, four minute meditations to
18:15:28 with that and then they have yoga but that's it. Okay, that's what it was someone told me that they have yoga, and we go and heard of that.
18:15:42 But ok, but I'll find you find you some other stretching related exercises to be good.
18:15:52 Any other goals that you thinking. No.
18:16:02 No.
18:15:59 No.
18:16:10 That's it. They got like where I'm at. I don't want to overwhelm myself to my habits that I'm trying to still build and. Yeah, and I think throughout the last three weeks you've made very good goals that you've kept up.
18:16:15 And so, in thinking about what you share today that you want to maintain that consistency. I think being able to continue with what you had before. And gradually adding more like today we are talking about stretching and weekly as you see how your goals
18:16:32 are going.
18:16:34 You can think about is there something new that I've want to implement or do I just want to continue with what I have and maybe enhance it a little bit, or add a little bit more to that.
18:16:48 I would say definitely think about the skills or the tools that have helped you moving forward. That way you can continue to use that as you go on. So for example, though, the weekly goal setting, if that's something that you find is actually helpful.
18:17:03 Then I definitely encourage you to set aside some time each week to set up some goals that you want to work on, especially related to health.
18:17:12 That way you can continue and keep that consistency that you want to keep.
18:17:18 Okay.
18:17:21 Any other successes that that you want to share, and then you mentioned the skin is glowing skin.
18:17:29 So I was like wow my skin looks real good. I'm so happy, um, no I yeah I just like that, it's starting to kind of like I said even just with the small goal of adding the blueberries to though me on how it's starting to kind of bleed into other things
18:17:45 I really like that. And so
18:17:50 sometimes we just need one step two, to get us going. Nice domino effect. Yeah. Now, absolutely. Are there any challenges that you are still having that you want us to talk through to maybe do some problem solving.
18:18:07 Just like I said I didn't track very well with the meditation and stuff. I have been trying to do it and like keep myself accountable, but it's kind of like interesting because it's this fine line that I'm walking between keeping accountability but then
18:18:24 like not wanting to make it a chore like this is supposed to be a relaxing thing to do and something to help me ground myself I don't want it to be.
18:18:34 Another thing on my list.
18:18:38 Yes, because the moment that you feel that it's another thing you have to do or another chore. I think that's when we start to lose that motivation and that consistency.
18:18:49 So I totally agree with you.
18:18:52 What are some ways that you can think of to, to address that. So when you start to feel that this is just becoming a bit of a chore, like what can like spice it up so that switch it up a bit or.
18:19:08 I just tried different breathing techniques.
18:19:12 Like, and then I think what I'll try and do is that instead of doing it after classes, especially because classes are ending now.
18:19:22 Maybe I'll do it after I'm done stretching and that's a nice way to kind of conclude that part of my day that I'm stretching session I'm not only gonna call it but, you know, just finding out when is the best plug for it in my day and then what I like,
18:19:45 what I'm going to get the most benefit from it.
18:19:48 Okay. You know, I think that's a good idea to in thinking about, because the way that I'm hearing is that you want to associate it with something that you're doing, but it sort of becomes just part of a normal, regular of this.
18:20:03 And I'm very much a creature of habit. I just down because I'm used to routine and comfort in it. That's why I have oatmeal every day so that's why it wasn't that big of a deal to put blueberries in my oatmeal or like why wasn't a big deal to add carrots
18:20:18 to or whatever vegetable I have on hand to my lunch because I had the same thing for lunch every day because it's just easy when you're a student to do that and not have to think about it and I think that's why I like routine in that way because it's
18:20:31 something I don't have to think about I don't have to decide it like we're dinner is a lot harder because it's like, well, what am I going to do for dinner tonight yeah I could very easily have the same thing for dinner tonight.
18:20:43 It's not that big of a deal.
18:20:46 At least during the week weekends little different but during the week. I don't care of other stuff on my mind. And as long as you eat something that's sort of the most important thing at that point.
18:20:59 I know it's sad to I guess because I like cooking I like doing that kind of stuff. But when, like I said when it becomes a chore when you have to.
18:21:07 When, when it's no longer fun and you like just need to get something so that you're eating something like that's when it's like a
18:21:19 night of exciting.
18:21:22 Think you have very a very good goal for this week and I'll send you what you had before to just so that you have a big summary of it.
18:21:31 I do want to ask you about the text messages from this last week, right here any that stood out to you, any message that motivated you to do something different or.
18:21:50 What happened.
18:21:58 I really liked the little photo.
18:22:07 You know,
18:22:07 I thought that was a really cute way to
18:22:11 to receive the advice, the, the one where it's like, you know, it's the time to share spend time with family and cook a meal together, you know, makes you like vegetable soup or turkey salad.
18:22:27 Like I thought that was really cute.
18:22:32 I like to mama this week honestly I thought they were really in the bingo one was cute
18:22:41 it motivated you to want to do some self care.
18:22:46 Yeah, I was like a you know. Yeah, well, cuz it, that one was good because like I said it was, it's hard for me to stop to slow down and so I was like, you know, it's okay like I need to just give myself permission to have this 1520 minutes it's 1520
18:23:05 minutes isn't going to make or break me, at least if I'm not doing something but it can like make or break me if I'm doing too much.
18:23:17 Yeah.
18:23:17 Yeah. Remember that we do need a break, whether it's a mental break a physical break.
18:23:24 Because that sort of help us to reset and then keep moving forward. Yeah, I think it's good. You know cuz I was so I'm on the board of the moot court program for this next coming year in law school and we're interviewing you know first years and other
18:23:45 mostly first year some second years to come and compete next year.
18:23:49 And it's like so. I think this program would be really good especially for the
18:23:59 graduate students.
18:24:18 The like masters and doctorate students, just because I know my undergrad I was not this, you know.
18:24:13 But now that I'm in law school I am and hearing these interviews with the other students, everyone is like yeah I can't tell you how many people I've had, tell me that they literally plan out every single moment of their day to the our scheduling their
18:24:28 meals scheduling their free time like, I'm just like oh my god like.
18:24:37 And I do it too. I did it i mean i did it to not quite to that extreme, but almost I did it last year around this, especially during the when the pandemic started that helped me stay disciplined and I get that, but it's just like, especially graduate
18:24:51 students and I imagine it's this way for him, and people in the master's programs and other doctor programs, it's just, you're going and going and going and it's just so much harder than undergrad, good so different to have the reminders to take care
18:25:10 of yourself, is just so important, because I know that I get burned out and I could feel myself getting burned out like we were talking about how I was just tired all the time and that's the first indication that I'm about to be, like, I'm done.
18:25:29 And how is that going this week because I know that's something that we talked about last week, and we were trying to figure out ways to, to sort of address it by taking some breaks a lot better, although I did.
18:25:43 I have been falling off the wagon on during my hour of studying for finals, a night.
18:25:50 I just haven't but it's okay, forgiving myself for that because you know I have this time now to do it. So, yeah, it was awful and at that point it wasn't being helpful.
18:26:02 So, now remember to be kind to yourself. I think we, we sent her own expectations right so it's it's good to remind ourselves that we are human beings, we do as much as we can.
18:26:13 And the idea of planning yes is very helpful but just like we talked about with exercise, we can overdo the planning to and causes more stress than it's needed.
18:26:27 hopefully, it continues to get better school be somewhat over soon.
18:26:32 Are you graduating this year. No next year, and I have a full summer and a full year next year but I'm excited for this summer so I don't think it'll be too bad, so it'll be.
18:26:45 It'll be okay. Yeah.
18:26:47 Okay, I think you, you are setting yourself up to definitely succeed and just remember to keep taking good care of yourself, which is very important.
18:26:59 So let's see. So, after today.
18:27:02 I will send you a summary about the goals that you set just like before.
18:27:18 As for next steps, you will be getting a few more text messages. I believe that you'll be getting them until this weekend.
18:27:16 So please feel free to continue responding with your thoughts to them, if you like.
18:27:24 You are also going to get a link for like a final follow up survey.
18:27:30 We should get that before the end of today. It's very similar to the one that you completed at the beginning but this one should be a little shorter.
18:27:38 It should be maybe 15 minutes instead of like 30 minutes.
18:27:42 Because the last one was quite heavy.
18:27:45 And once you complete that survey will be reaching out to set up a follow up interview. So, are. But that's not going to be done by me, it'll be done by one of my other colleagues because they want to get sort of your unbiased opinion and they don't want
18:28:03 me to take the interview and research protocols, I guess you could call them. And ideally, they want to do it around the same time where we would meet.
18:28:15 So Wednesdays at six.
18:28:27 Do you think that would work for you for next week. If you hold on let me check. Because I know finals are coming up.
18:28:30 Oh, Yeah, that's fine. Yeah. OK, so I'm going to tentatively book it for Wednesday at six.
18:28:37 And that may 5.
18:28:41 And then once you complete the survey, you'll get the final my calendar invite with the link details.
18:28:54 It will be a different link than the one that we've been using because someone else's coordinating the actual zoom interview for that.
18:29:03 And just know that for for that part of the interview in might be a little longer, so it might be 40 to 60 minutes.
18:29:13 That, such as sort of a heads up, in case you.
18:29:18 If it doesn't work just let me know, we can figure out a better time.
18:29:23 I'm hoping it's 40 minutes, kind of we have left to do.
18:29:27 But that should be coming up next week. So today I'll send you the survey, just feel free to complete it as soon as you're able.
18:29:36 That way, you'll be able to to sort of get it out of the way.
18:29:40 Our main investigator does want the surveys to be completed before the interview. So just know that that it should be completed before making
18:29:54 any questions they have.
18:29:58 And I really want to thank you for participating in our program. It has been a pleasure to work with you and i mean i think you you got it all down. I'm hoping that I was somewhat helpful in anything that you achieve, and that you keep going.
18:30:14 And just as we talked about sometimes there's things in life that maybe are out of our control but if we focus on the things that we have a connection to and that we can control then that can help us to really manage our health and our wellness.
18:30:29 So hopefully you've gained some skills, continue using that goal setting that we talked about. so you can continue to achieve your, your future goals.
18:30:39 Take care.
18:30:41 Best of luck with the rest of the semester, and next year, you're graduating this year, I guess I have one more semester of summer.
