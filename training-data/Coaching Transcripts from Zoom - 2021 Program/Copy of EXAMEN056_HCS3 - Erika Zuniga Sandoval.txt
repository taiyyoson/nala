09:32:24 Recently putting in like a bunch of gardening.
09:32:30 Yeah, it looks it looks really cute.
09:32:34 Yeah.
09:32:37 Well, thank you for being. Join me today. We have a lot to catch up on.
09:32:45 So to start, I would ask, how was the week with your goals that you set up. I know you are going to continue meditation, and you also work in a meal prep for the week so how did it go.
09:32:59 So the, the meditation went well. I did meal prep that day that we spoke on it. However, I had a really difficult time eating the food.
09:33:11 I'm not sure why, but I just was like nah, like, they'll say mental how and then it was when okay so I did it on Monday right we checked in on Monday,
09:33:38 and your goal was to prepare the meals. So you prepare the meal. So I would say that was, that was the point right of the original goal.
09:33:49 But it's, you learn something really interesting that even though you prepare the meal there was like probably something going on that sort of affected your appetite.
09:34:00 Is there a lot going on with with school and work. Yeah, the stress level on a scale of one to 10.
09:34:11 I would say probably one to 10, probably close to a nine. Yeah.
09:34:18 Yeah, I just because it's like my finals week, and like I have a lot of
09:34:26 projects and homework assignments and.
09:34:30 Yeah.
09:34:32 Could be a response to the stress that you're feeling right.
09:34:38 Sometimes just can affect our appetite and at either stream either we eat a lot or we don't eat.
09:34:48 was there.
09:34:50 But did you find that the actual action that you wanted to do which was to meal prep that was something that you were able to easily do or for their barriers that came up with that.
09:35:02 Not really, honestly, I think it was really easy for me to do it i mean i went to Costco, and I bought a couple of things. and then I cooked, it was fine.
09:35:14 I guess the food just wasn't very appetizing. I tried to like put more veggies like I put potatoes.
09:35:25 And what are those green long ones called I always forget.
09:35:31 Yeah asparagus.
09:35:34 And what else oh and mushrooms. So potatoes burgers mushrooms. And then I did, beef, like meatballs kind of like iPhone the guys but.
09:35:46 And then I did a little sauce to put it over it.
09:35:51 So yeah, I mean the first two days, I was like okay this is this is tasty. It's good.
09:36:11 And then afterwards I was just like, Oh, I don't want to eat it and they're still sitting on my fridge and throw it away because it's been some days already.
09:36:11 New. Do you think it might also have to do just with needing to add. Was it the same meal every day of the week that you have here. Yeah, just for lunch.
09:36:22 Okay. For breakfast I switched it up the breakfast, I kept up with my breakfast. Okay.
09:36:30 Do you find that because your morning Neil has more variety you're more likely to eat that.
09:36:37 Probably because, like I did.
09:36:43 Just a couple days and then other days I did oatmeal then other days I just did fruits.
09:36:51 So, I switched it up.
09:37:15 Maybe something similar needs to happen with with lunch, so that it seems more appetizing but you were able to do your goal which was to meal prep you did the meal prep.
09:37:13 And, what, what are you hoping to check in about today.
09:37:17 What are you hoping to check in about today. What's going on this week that you want to focus on or is, or do you want to continue working on the things that you're already doing.
09:37:27 Yeah, I mean I really wanted to start kind of being more active physically how we spoke about.
09:37:36 But I don't have a shower right now they're remodeling my bathroom and it's taking like two weeks already so I go shower and my partners or my brothers and.
09:37:50 So if I work out I'm going to want to have. I want to shower right away, but I plan ahead and let them know like if I'm going to use their bathroom. So it's like not possible I guess you can say.
09:38:05 But I think, stick to like meditating. Again, I'm like at least through time.
09:38:13 And.
09:38:17 And I know you doing,
09:38:21 you're doing meditation 10 minutes, three times a week so you want to view to continue with that.
09:38:27 Yeah. Just because this week's gonna be really crazy. So I feel like I want to be realistic. Yeah, no, I think that makes perfect sense. And so I can continue that we're not from before, and how confident Do you feel that your body will be able to do
09:38:45 that.
09:38:46 The meditating, three times I feel pretty confident because I was planning on doing it today.
09:38:53 And I'm yeah, I'm more than likely do it like today, tomorrow and Thursday.
09:39:00 In the morning, in the morning or before I go to sleep because I know I'm gonna have to decompress a little bit because I have a lot going on.
09:39:09 I will be Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday.
09:39:21 Mm hmm.
09:39:14 In terms of confidence. On a scale of one to 10, what would be the reading or confidence that you would have probably made.
09:39:33 And that's something that you've been able to continue to do from from week one, so I think you're, you're on a good path there.
09:39:43 Is there anything else that you want to work on for this week or do you think the meditation will be the most realistic part to continue for this week.
09:39:56 Um, I think I want to drink more water.
09:40:00 Right now I think the food will parts going to be a little difficult because I can't meal prep I'm not going to have much time.
09:40:07 And a whole bunch of laundry I have to fold them totally.
09:40:11 So, I want to see drinking more water.
09:40:17 I'm good, and drinking like my gallon.
09:40:23 But it's been tough because of the bathroom situation. I have to pour water in the toilet to flush. So, I don't want to do that.
09:40:40 Cuz it's gonna be you know I have to tell you more frequently when I drink our water. Yeah, that's true.
09:40:43 So what are you thinking.
09:40:46 Let's see how many hours on
09:40:55 your mentioned that you want to be able to do a gallon did you want to do pack with that.
09:41:01 Yeah.
09:41:03 Or think about how much water do you think you're drinking right now. Let's start they're probably like
09:41:11 three water bottles, so like 616 times three.
09:41:17 Yeah, what 16 times.
09:41:24 That's 4848.
09:41:28 That's how little bit.
09:41:33 Do you want to add one more.
09:41:38 Yeah.
09:41:39 How much would that be 16 more than 6464 ounces, which is tech kind of almost half of a gallon, which is a cup.
09:41:53 Yeah.
09:41:56 So for water bottles. Yeah.
09:42:02 I already drink one half.
09:42:08 16.
09:42:14 And how many days. coming.
09:42:19 Will do.
09:42:23 Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
09:42:31 Saturday and Sunday, probably not.
09:42:33 Okay, so that's four days.
09:42:43 And I assume that something that you will do sort of throughout the day. You're not going to just chuck for.
09:42:49 Right, water, and any specific thing. Okay, throughout the day.
09:42:57 It's also getting warmer. And so, this will help you stay hydrated.
09:43:05 And how confident, do you feel about being able to drink the 416 ounce water bottles for four days this this week.
09:43:14 I'm probably a as well.
09:43:19 These are good kiss yeah it's it's definitely getting warmer man and water intake, it's gonna get important in the next few months. Yeah, I mean it's always important.
09:43:33 Specially in the next few seconds one.
09:43:37 Anything else for this week.
09:43:40 Those are very good. Those two are very good.
09:43:43 I'm not sure if you want to add anything. No, I think that's it. So I did the meditating for three days, and the law. Right.
09:43:52 Yes, and the water intake, increasing the retreat for water.
09:43:57 Okay.
09:44:00 Let's go.
09:44:01 Let me ask you about the messages that you received this last week, any messages that stood out to you.
09:44:10 Any that sort of motivate you to want to do something.
09:44:17 Honestly this weekend was tough.
09:44:22 Because of my vaccine. But the one that I thought was really cute actually was the bingo one.
09:44:32 I was like okay that's not realistic for me for over the weekend but I feel like another day, that'd be really cute and I actually thought about like making copies of this.
09:44:43 So, I mean, the text messages to continue to have them on your phone with you decide to delete them.
09:44:51 But yes, the self correcting go. It's a good one to try and how are you feeling now.
09:44:59 I know you mentioned that you had quite a few side effects from the second dose How are you feeling.
09:45:07 I feel better. Um, I just found out I was like totally random, and irrelevant but I just found out like a couple minutes before meeting that one of our students tested.
09:45:22 If and still did one of my co workers and I was around them because we work in the same space. So that kind of like, got me a little bit more worried because I was like maybe that's why I felt side effects, I don't know.
09:45:37 So, I mean, I'm going to go get tested tomorrow but I just saw a little upset because my Boston and he hasn't communicated with anyone and apparently he already knew by Friday.
09:45:51 So I think that's why I'm a little like I don't know like stressed out more.
09:45:59 In terms of contact tracing.
09:46:03 I think, do they have like a protocol of how to notify folks Hey you might have been exposed supposedly they had a protocol.
09:46:11 I mean they haven't communicated so it's been three weeks since we started working on campus and it's like, y'all should have already reached out to people, because there's a small school so like, you know, we're all close to each other.
09:46:30 I'm so sorry that you having to go through that, that is just extra stress in your life, you know that you really don't need.
09:46:37 Yeah, and I feel around like family. Mm hmm.
09:46:50 So, it just adds another level of stress, another layer one when were you, I guess, how long ago, good well you've been working so you've been with them every single day at school.
09:47:00 So I'm on campus, Wednesdays Thursdays and Fridays. and I saw him on Thursday Thursday. Okay.
09:47:14 I feel like I should already I should be fine because I would out something. But then again, I have my vaccine.
09:47:22 So, you know, the mean.
09:47:25 And it's a little strange because I feel there is a certain.
09:47:44 And like a degree of contact like say you just pass them by then the likelihood is very minimal right because I feel there has to be constant recurrent exposure for them, you to have a higher probability of also like catching it, per se.
09:47:50 Yeah.
09:47:51 So, it might be that you're okay.
09:47:55 In any case, you have your vaccine.
09:47:59 And hopefully that will protect you.
09:48:01 But I hear your concern about others right you've been around others and that is also a concern. I mean, honestly the responsible thing would be to definitely get tested for your own peace of mind and let others know just so that they get tested to
09:48:20 No no I.
09:48:22 This is a little bit random and I'm kind of calling on a tangent but I feel it's similar to like STI texting and when someone test positive or like an STI then the responsible thing is to let your partner know so that they can get tested, and then there
09:48:41 How have you okay yeah I mean it's totally different, but it's still a virus.
09:48:52 So,
09:48:52 worked out, hopefully.
09:48:56 I mean, and usually you might not be able to test, like it might not be detected within the first few days, because I remember seeing something about.
09:49:07 If you think you've been exposed to maybe wait like seven to eight days to get tested.
09:49:16 Okay, what's been Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday five days.
09:49:32 I'm gonna get tested tomorrow. Yeah, that should be a day I'm just worried about my family, because not everybody has the vaccine like my parents do my partner doesn't.
09:49:34 And I was around my newborn if you too.
09:49:39 I mean I was wearing my mask but still they give up that anxiety.
09:49:44 But I yeah I have a feeling everything's gonna be fine my partners and they get tested today at work, because he works at Stanford so he gets like immediate priority.
09:49:55 And he could get his results by tomorrow too.
09:49:59 That's good. That's one of the things that I've been wondering like how soon are results coming in now because especially I hear that not as many before getting tested anymore.
09:50:08 Makes me wonder like how soon yeah well. Last week I got tested because I tried to get tested every week.
09:50:16 So last week I got tested.
09:50:19 I usually get tested on Walgreens, they have free drive bys.
09:50:25 And I get my results. The next day.
09:50:28 Yeah, but when this all started I was also getting tested I Walgreens and it would take like three to four days.
09:50:35 So I think you're right i think is because that a lot of people are getting tested anymore yeah that not as many are getting tested as well. Most people are getting the vaccine so there's, there's this sense of security on the vaccine itself which is
09:50:49 good.
09:50:51 But we still need to get because you may still be carrying it around.
09:50:57 So you still you're
09:51:00 Coming back to.
09:51:02 I think it's, it's possible like if you have.
09:51:06 If I don't know if this is like part of your role or not but like if it's possible. I would appreciate maybe like some positive message jeans or like some affirmations, things like that, because you know it's a text and I'll read it out loud on the spot.
09:51:23 That would be helpful this week because it's going to be very tough week like I have a long to do list and have a lot of anxiety around meeting deadlines.
09:51:35 Yeah, I can
09:51:41 make a note section here.
09:51:48 That's fine I'll speak you mentioned right.
09:51:51 Yes.
09:51:57 Are you done this year.
09:52:00 I guess I graduate.
09:52:09 Yeah, I'm fully done in June.
09:52:13 Yeah, But this is my last class for spring.
09:52:19 Okay, so the you're going to be in the commencement to write ceremony.
09:52:25 So what I want to Is it okay if we meet again on Monday. Yes. So, next week will be our session for Yeah, thank you so much for inviting me open up this handy dandy calendar here, so that we can do local in the morning.
