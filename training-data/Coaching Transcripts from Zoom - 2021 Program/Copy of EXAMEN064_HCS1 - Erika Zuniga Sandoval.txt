12:04:46 degree in psychology.
12:04:50 Some, like, focusing it like Marriage and Family Therapy.
12:04:53 So I'm about to finish my first year this this upcoming semester.
12:05:01 And before that I went to undergrad at SF State so I've been in San Francisco for like six years now.
12:05:09 Um, my goals I, I've never had a health coach before I have a therapist.
12:05:17 It's like, it's like I feel like it's similar except like I don't bet to you about like personal problems.
12:05:23 But I do have somewhat of an idea but like a health coach can help you do. And I think what I want to focus on is like goal setting in terms of my, my physical health, and work a little bit more on also, I guess it ties in together like my self confidence
12:05:42 with my physical health, and so those two are super important for me. I'm focusing on here just because in my therapy, I focus on my mental health more so, if I kind of want to keep those two separate so that I can really like hone in and like take, take
12:06:00 as much as I can from these health coaching session.
12:06:04 I think you put it perfectly. And there's there's different things that we seek when we need support, and it sounds like you already know that you need support to maintain like a positive like mental health outlook and to help you sort of manage any thing
12:06:24 thats related to mental health, which I think it's absolutely great much needed.
12:06:31 And, but I also think you bring up another good point. A lot of these things are interconnected right or mental health affects our physical health, physical health can affect our mental health.
12:06:44 And I think it's great that you are able to to identify each, but know that they're very interconnected. So my goal as you mentioned, I will do my best to support you in your physical health.
12:06:57 But know that you want to continue doing your your mental health and and caring about that because that's going to also support you and help you.
12:07:07 So yeah.
12:07:09 Any other thoughts that you have about, what do you want to check in about what do you hope to get or gain from the sessions.
12:07:17 Yeah, I mean I think it's just more of like that health us.
12:07:23 I really enjoyed, like, like your texts, I don't know if it's just us sending them with someone else.
12:07:30 I really like the ones that kind of centered around you which one it is kind of about like being grateful about life and stuff I think that like in the morning you kind of just like reading you're like okay like, Yes, I don't know, like the one you gave
12:07:49 earlier when I got recently was.
12:08:03 and I read that and I was like oh yeah like I started think and then just like my thoughts started going and then my, my day just got like, you know, just a little extra boost of like, I'm so happy to be living the life I am living, even though there's
12:08:16 a lot of improvements that I want, but like in kind of centered like happiness and so I really like things like that like I was a gal.
12:08:24 That was nice.
12:08:26 I'm so glad I'm getting chills.
12:08:30 And so there, so every day you will be getting a text message and just like you said, and the text message comes from, it's, it's automated because we're sending to everyone that's participating, whoever your responses.
12:08:45 I get to see directly and I can get to reply to those. Okay.
12:08:50 So, so keep responding, I did see that you, you love that message, yeah notification. So keep responding to the messages that you love.
12:08:59 If they bring up any thoughts or ideas, feel free to share those, and I can always respond, or if you have questions about them.
12:09:08 You feel free to respond and I'll do my best to to answered, the best way I get.
12:09:15 Yeah.
12:09:16 Awesome. So glad there's definitely a specific question about messages that stood out to you. So, that that's you give us a great example.
12:09:27 In thinking about the messages that you've received. And you also mentioned that it sort of motivated you to focus more on happiness or centered your day around that.
12:09:40 So keep also making observations about, are some of the messages that we're sending you motivating you to do like something else around your health, because I think that's all great information that can help us as we move forward and figuring out what
12:09:55 will be the best way to to continue this program. So, all your feedback is going to be absolutely useful and helpful to us. Okay.
12:10:06 So let me ask you a little bit about that. The stress situation so every week, I will be asking. On a scale of one to 10 What was your stress level for this week so what would you say you would be at for now one is not stress and 10 is very stressed.
12:10:28 Um, I would say I'm at, like, five, which was like, I know it's like right in the middle but it's it's out of five, because I'm not stressed. Presently, but I'm stressed about, like, next week, already.
12:10:46 So, I'm really not stressed, but I'm already like stressed about next week so my.
12:10:54 And sometimes, you know, we are, it's part of planning ahead, and hopefully when you get to next week you'll realize that you'll be fine.
12:11:03 Right. Hopefully that's the goal.
12:11:05 Okay.
12:11:07 So you mentioned a little bit earlier about how you're working on, mental health, and you want to focus more on the physical health in overall when you're thinking about your goals.
12:11:21 How would you say that you are doing and meeting those health goals that you've had in the past.
12:11:29 Let's say if you had to give it a rating of one to 10, like are you doing really well, and that will be a 10 or so so I think I'm in the past have been like at a seven.
12:11:45 I'm just because I feel like I get there like I reached my goal.
12:11:50 But then once I reached my goal I kind of go back down. Like I revert back to like my old habits so it's like I'm able to reach my goal that I've never able to maintain it.
12:12:02 And so I think that's like a seven for me because it's like every single time I want to start a new health goal I achieve it, but then once I achieve it.
12:12:17 I'm like, okay, like, and then it slowly like not on purpose but like I noticed I slowly go back down and then like a cycle. Yeah, so that maintenance piece, it's, it's key right yeah, I absolutely hear you on that.
12:12:27 So as you think about things that have worked in the past.
12:12:32 What is something that you want to focus for this upcoming week so that's sort of the idea of goal setting and that's really what I feel the health coach is going to be here the most for and also to discuss anything else that comes up.
12:12:45 But is there a specific goal that you want to work on for this upcoming week. And the way that we do this is we want to make the goals and using that smart mechanism of making them very specific making them measurable, attainable relevant and timely.
12:13:04 So the goal or the purpose will be for you to set a goal this week. And ideally, we're going to be checking weekly so my hope is that we can check in again, if Wednesday's work for you at noon, we can continue to check in every Wednesday at noon.
12:13:21 And then next Wednesday, you will tell me how did you do with your goal. So it should be something that you can do in the period of a week.
12:13:28 Okay.
12:13:35 I,
12:13:38 I think I'm trying to
12:13:45 what would be realistic and achievable.
12:13:49 I think, try.
12:13:53 Like a new way to work out.
12:13:57 So, not in a way where it's so I love running like I'm a very much like active runner. But that's all I do like I don't really go to the gym. Well, now I go to the gym but even then when I'm at the gym because I'm a runner, I just like, go to the treadmills,
12:14:13 and I think I would love to get stronger.
12:14:19 And I think try getting out of my comfort zone would be a good goal by like maybe
12:14:27 like doing a workout that involves like free weights like those dumbbells.
12:14:33 Maybe, yeah.
12:14:36 I don't know how it does that sound like a goal or no, That's it, anything that you want to do, will sound. Well, we can make it into a goal. So, what I'm hearing is you're talking about strength training, you want to do some strengthening, whether that's
12:14:52 for your arms or for your legs. Right.
12:14:55 And some ways that you're thinking you can do that is by using free weights.
12:15:01 And you mentioned you have access to a gym had, how do you feel about doing maybe, I don't know like five minutes of strength training, when you go to the gym so let's say you typically like to do the running.
12:15:15 So as a warm up you could do some of the weights or maybe as part of your cool down you could do some of the waves.
12:15:23 What do you think about that.
12:15:25 Yeah, I mean I can do that. Yeah, because I do think that we have to center it around the things that you like to do. So you like running, let's make sure that you're able to continue with that, but just add like a little extra to it so that it has its
12:15:46 place.
12:15:46 And that way also you're still able to do your running, and you don't feel that now you're just doing this one thing that you're kind of not sure about a right.
12:15:58 Yeah, but you do want to do it. So, and I do find that once we start with one thing that we enjoy it can push us to do something else as well.
12:16:07 So you have access to the gym. If.
12:16:11 And you have access to wait.
12:16:16 Yes.
12:16:16 So for this upcoming week, how many days do you want to be able to do this to practice the, the strength training.
12:16:26 Wednesday.
12:16:30 I don't work weekend so it would actually be realistic, I can do like.
12:16:41 I can do it four times, Four times, and that will be between Monday and Friday. Right.
12:16:51 Right. Oh next Oh I thought was starting like tomorrow.
12:16:54 Yeah, we're starting tomorrow. So the way that, so then it would be.
12:17:00 That's it too so it'll be from Thursday to next Wednesday.
12:17:04 Okay, yeah.
12:17:05 Yeah, I can do that.
12:17:16 Any friends, four times it's very feasible because you have seven days and the next week so it can be up to you to decide when. If you select specific days.
12:17:27 It's good because then your goal is more specific and it pushes you to be more likely to say okay if I said that I'm going to do this on Thursday, then I'll do it on Thursday.
12:17:41 Now I'm thinking already I'm also a planner, like, I have my here.
12:17:48 So I'm thinking I can do, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, because my weekends are more open versus like during the week I know that I focused more on like school and work, and I'm like trying to be like realistic with like, okay, I can do it but
12:18:06 I just need to do it on the weekend. Yes, I definitely think that if you add it to your schedule. Now, it'll also help you to to sort of have reminders, because my next question to you is actually how are you going to remind yourself to do it, or how
12:18:25 will you measure your progress. So the other thing that we do need to decide is for how long you're going to do it. So we've already decided that activity which is like strength training, the days of the week, and or the times in the week, but how, how
12:18:40 much length of time.
12:18:45 Or maybe repetitions, length of time as in like, like, oh 20 minutes or 30 minutes or length of time as in like days of the week.
12:18:55 The duration so the the 20 minutes, 30 minutes. Yeah, I think I really want to, um, I love challenging myself so I think I can challenge myself to do minimum of 20 minutes.
12:19:10 I just would have to like figure out what workouts didn't
12:19:18 think of some I think I may have some resources for like strengthening videos, I, I just remembered. So, the new gym that I signed up for. They gave me a free personal training class and it's actually on Friday.
12:19:35 So I can just ask since it's like a free personal training class session, I will just ask him to focus more on like what workouts I can do for strength training and then I'll remember those to do.
12:19:47 Yeah, I just remember that.
12:19:49 There you go. I think yes that is perfect. Think about the resources that you already have that you can take advantage of. So I think that's a perfect idea, and so on Friday, he can check in with them too and ask them, what are some good strength training
12:20:05 exercises, and you want to have like a set of 20 minutes that you can do.
12:20:14 So that's how we'll measure progress whether you were able to do 20 minutes or not. And why do you say, Why would you say that this is important to you mentioned that you're a runner you love running, but you want to focus a little bit more on string.
12:20:27 Why, um, I want to focus more on strength because I think I just want something new, just so backtrack like in high school I was never a runner, like I hated exercise in general like I it was not my thing like I'm, I was not run they're like honest, I
12:20:54 overweight in high school like the doctor and everything like it was just not a good time for my health. And then when it came to college and also I think because back home we don't really have like respect we only had one gem and that one Jim everyone
12:21:01 goes to and like no one was just like, yeah, it was just like all these factors and so when I moved to SF. We had like this new gym and not only that but we actually had like, I would see people running on the street and I'd be like, oh, like, that's
12:21:14 actually normal I guess like in my hometown like if you run like everyone will see you like, you know, so it's kind of that and then I just like challenged myself to like become a runner and then, like, slowly actually loved it and like I started doing
12:21:28 like late comer said and then I started doing like Golden Gate Park and then Nana and there was just a natural thing that I just love doing and I was like wow and then I see how I was like six years ago and then now and I'm like, I would have never been
12:21:41 able to run like four miles straight like that's just not something I would do and I think it's like I'm at a point in my life where I want to like get a new challenge but something that's like it's intimidating for me because.
12:22:07 training is just like I'm weak, like I've tried to do it in the past and I can barely I remember I could barely lift up like a 10 pounder and like compared to like other guys and I, of course I'm comparing myself to the people at the gym, so it's like
12:22:12 not good but I also see other women who are really super strong and I'm just thinking the gym with like my 10 pounders and I'm just like embarrassed I'd rather not do it and so it's just like all of these factors and I think I'm at the point of my life
12:22:20 where it's like, I'm a good runner, I can do cardio like nothing but like when it comes to strength training like that really like kicks me in literally a physical way but also in like my confidence.
12:22:33 And I don't know like I just want to like not be that way anymore and I want a new challenge and I think that's why I want to do it because I am like the weakling of my friends are like, you know, it's just like in that, in that sense, like, I don't like
12:22:47 working with my friends because they're strong for women I think they're strong and I'm just like, when we, when they lift, I'm like at me to take off like those two things that you have on like I'll just do the bar and then that makes me not want to
12:23:01 do it because then I just look like the girl it's just with the bar and yeah so it's all these things and I just like want to be confident enough for myself and like strength wise like I want to feel good and I don't know it's just for me like I want
12:23:15 a new challenge and.
12:23:18 But I want this challenge to be like a silent challenge for myself like I don't want to be like very like boastful body like I just kind of want to work on it for me and then just see how it goes.
12:23:30 Yeah, I think that's a great way to start. And you've been able to challenge yourself before because you give it the great example of how you are not a runner before and now you are.
12:23:41 So you've definitely been able to find ways to, to make changes in your life, and as you're thinking about this new adventure or this new challenge. Think of all the things that helped you to become a runner, because those same motivations, those same
12:23:59 ways that you were able to problem solve and like push yourself to become a runner, you have those skills within you, you've used them before. So it's just a matter of sort of Lino turning them on and reminding yourself that you're able to do this, and
12:24:14 I would say, you know, when you start. Remember when you started running. Were you able to run a mile right away.
12:24:25 No. So think of it the same way when you think of ways.
12:24:28 You're not going to be, you might not be able to do no 2030 pounds at the beginning, but if you start with five with 10 and gradually as you mentioned that you not can run for miles.
12:24:42 Yeah. So, that way. Right.
12:24:46 But, but you you've been able to do it before and I think that's what I would want you to focus on the fact that you've been able to do something before and now it's just a different area where you can use those same skills to do it.
12:25:00 Yeah.
12:25:02 Right. Yeah.
12:25:04 And it's it's, there's always gonna be people around us that have an opinion about anything and everything. And so I completely understand your feelings of you want to do this for yourself and for your own health and for your well being.
12:25:20 And just think of all the benefits, you've seen the benefits of running so think of all the benefits that strength training can also bring you, It can be really good for your bones and your bone density, because we know as we get older and as women that's
12:25:34 something that's going to affect this later on in life.
12:25:37 So definitely think about all the good things that come along with having good strength.
12:25:43 Yeah.
12:25:47 So in thinking about your goal for this upcoming week. We mentioned that you want to practice strength training, you're going to meet with a personal trainer on Friday, and get some ideas of exercises.
12:26:00 You want to be able to do strength training for four times during the week for about 20 minutes.
12:26:07 If you had to give yourself a confidence level of about meeting your goal for this upcoming week, on a scale of one, not so confident and 10 completely confident how confident Do you feel that your achieve your goal.
12:26:27 I would say like,
12:26:34 I would say like, I could do it so it's like six.
12:26:43 What do you feel is the hesitation.
12:26:46 Because I send some hesitation.
12:26:49 Why, why, how can we increase that confidence level.
12:26:55 I just, I know that I can get myself to the gym, and I know that I can get there.
12:27:02 But I don't know that once I'm there I'm going to shy away from like the weight, the weight area where it's like because my like our gym I'm going to it's like you walk up the stairs so the bottom, cardio so it's like super easy for me because I just
12:27:16 I just go there right away. But then you go to the stairs and there's literally two areas, and there's like one like a pulldown room or whatever, and the other side's like all the heavy weights and like all of these like guys like you know everyone and
12:27:31 I usually if I do go upstairs and say okay I'll maybe I'll go like, you know, this way and then I ended up.
12:27:37 I ended up grabbing maybe like a five pounder but still going to a cool down session and link going down in the room. So it's like I know I can get myself to the gym, it's not going to be a problem and you know workout and stuff but I think I just when
12:27:51 I'm there I get like anxiety.
12:27:53 Mm hmm of like, I don't know, seeing someone that I know and like oh, what are you doing here, and like, I don't know, being like weird, or like feeling pressure to like, or like what if I do something wrong and I just look down and then I don't know
12:28:08 so I'm just like, I'm already getting like anxiety thinking about that. So, yeah, what can we do to help that can you think of how do you feel about starting with some exercises at home.
12:28:25 Yeah, I actually do have, when it was quarantine I have some like small waves, but there's small like they're literally like a five pound, and an eight pounds.
12:28:37 Yeah, and that's a good way to start with because you can just increase repetitions, and that can also help to build strength.
12:28:47 So that that might be a good way to start to. And then as you get more comfortable with it, you're still going to the gym for other running. So you could, you know, test the waters.
12:29:00 There's also I'm like actually excited for Friday to like go and see this, the personal trainer just because I think if he even teaches me like three workouts that I can do and like I can do them the right way then I'll feel confident to at least do those
12:29:16 three workouts and like, you know, not, not feel like I'm doing it the wrong way because I was taught how to do it the right way.
12:29:24 I'm actually looking forward to Friday I think Friday will like set the tone for my, my confidence with weights. Okay. Yeah. Very good. So in thinking about Friday and having the training session.
12:29:39 Do you feel that will increase your confidence level and if so, what would it increase it to.
12:29:46 I think you want to increase it by like a lot, I, I feel like I'd be like, at a solid like nine and a half.
12:29:53 I don't want to say 10 just cuz i don't know but I feel like I honestly like I have one friend whose personal trainer and their track they've tried to train me, and I thought was a bad idea because they're already my friends so I was already just like
12:30:08 not, but they did teach me like some things and I feel like after that I felt confident enough to do like machines which is like, not the best but like so.
12:30:20 I'm like, I felt pretty confident after like oh, like I don't have to do this right, but that was also not a good idea though because I was really shy to like doing things because they were my friend, but yeah, okay, yeah it's it's different when it's
12:30:36 friends, helping they have the best intentions, always remember that.
12:30:40 But it really depends on where we are in our process of changing and wanting to do things and how comfortable we feel it's something I'm hoping that Friday goes absolutely well and it gives it will give you a lot of ideas on things that that he can absolutely
12:30:56 work on.
12:30:58 Is there anything else that you want to work on for this week or do you want to just start with the strength training, and then see how we go.
12:31:05 Um, I think it's just starting with the strength training.
12:31:16 I booked I blocked the whole hour so don't worry.
12:31:19 I think like another thing I don't know if it's for this because like as I'm thinking about goals, it's like, so this weekend I'm actually, I'm a very social person like I always need someone around.
12:31:30 But this weekend I think I want to be, I want to have like a me weekend, and every weekend I say that, and every weekend I end up like caving in to like going out with my friends, or like, even if it's just like a Hangout, like my like my roommates friend's
12:31:50 friend's house that we go to. It's like I always end up air or like, but like, even though I don't want to, like, does that make sense like I would really love to like be in my room and stuff but then somehow I always cave into like going out and like
12:32:05 this weekend like my roommates got was my roommates are gone so it's like I have the whole my whole apartment to myself. And it's like, I want to say, Yeah, like I want to honestly make this the first weekend that I actually spend by myself because I
12:32:20 love solidarity, but I hate feeling alone.
12:32:29 So let's also be what is an action that you can do and thinking about setting like a specific goal.
12:32:36 What is an action that you want to do that can be measurable that will count towards Do you feeling a sense of having. Meantime, or I'm going to do something that's just for me.
12:32:51 I think it's just putting my phone on Do Not Disturb and reading, I love reading, I read when I'm on my commute, like on my on the bus and stuff but when I get home, I just don't my, my books like literally disappear like I don't.
12:33:08 I think it's just putting my phone dropped just started because I'm friend group chats are just the best, but also very toxic in a way where it's like I never could disconnect.
12:33:20 Mm hmm.
12:33:21 And how long do you want to do that for is it going to be for a certain amount of hours, certain amount of days, how, when are you going to put your phone on Do Not Disturb what's an ideal.
12:33:35 I think Friday and Saturday. That's.
12:33:38 Those are the days that I think will be a little hard for me to not want to see my friends are especially now that everything's opening up like my it's intense.
12:33:50 It is, it is.
12:33:53 Okay.
12:33:54 I am a personal side note, I'm a, I'm very much an introvert. So the quarantine has been lovely to me.
12:34:03 I don't have to do everything is like, sorry. Yeah.
12:34:10 I just like all of us, we're all working like in a healthcare setting so we're all like vaccinated and all these things so it's like, we like, even if I say like, oh, Rob, to kind of like we're all vaccinated we've all been in like a quarantine group
12:34:30 so it's like you can't even say like no, so it's just like,
12:34:27 It's fine. I will stay strong this weekend, can I do want to be by myself.
12:34:34 I like it a lot. It's just I end up painting in that's always been a problem.
12:34:39 So it's so the goal is going to be to put your phone on Do Not Disturb Friday and Saturday.
12:34:47 I'm trying to think of how we can measure the progress for that.
12:34:51 What do you think will be a good way to measure and.
12:34:55 Oh, and then because you mentioned that you're going to be reading. There we go.
12:35:01 finish my book, maybe read. Yeah, because I'm thinking what's measurable, well if you're able to do this, then you'll be able to read.
12:35:17 And you mentioned quite a few reasons of why this is important to you, you want to just have some time for yourself.
12:35:25 And how confident, do you feel about being able to do this go.
12:35:30 I know that's a really good question. Honestly, I'm really really good at, like, I'm going to do it and I
12:35:38 think without my roommates being here, it will be easier. Um, so I would say like a solid like four.
12:35:46 Okay.
12:35:49 So, when I'm thinking about confidence level. It's the how sure you feel that you're going to do your goal. So typically when someone tells me a six or below it tells me that they're still thinking about it, it tells me that there's some reason why I
12:36:07 think they made, there's barriers that might come up that will prevent them to do it. So what are some of those barriers that you think might come up and what can we do to address them so that you have a higher confidence level of achieving your goal,
12:36:21 some barriers.
12:36:27 I just
12:36:30 so okay this is so kind of well I just didn't get to the point. But basically, part of my friend group.
12:36:37 It's just like, they're just so persistent like it's like come on, even if it's for an hour and then I tell myself it's an hour. It's not an hour and to be really long time and then took a cycle so even when I try to set boundaries for myself.
12:36:52 I just get like persuaded into it.
12:36:55 So that's why I'm like, it's a for because what if like I do have my phone on Do Not Disturb.
12:37:02 But I'm on my computer, which has happened in the past, and they pop up on my computer and I'm like, oh yeah like I will just you know you can also turn that off right.
12:37:15 Just putting it.
12:37:17 Okay so putting on Do Not Disturb on my computer as well.
12:37:22 Okay, I honestly I will do that just because I don't do that and then I end up getting the text on my on my computer. So it's like I don't get them on my phone.
12:37:30 But when I'm studying or doing something on my computer, they like pop up in the corner and I'm like, naturally I have to click and then it goes down a rabbit hole.
12:37:39 Yeah that's honestly why
12:37:44 yeah and and it does happen, it, so let's say if you put your phone and your computer on. Do Not Disturb what will be your confidence level then I can do it.
12:37:55 I think with, like, honestly, I can do it I think it's without like outside factors like it's only an hour, or like you're right down the street or like, you know, stuff like that like I.
12:38:09 Yeah.
12:38:09 And because on my own. I'm fine. Like I truly am but there's what, there's a day of a weekend where my phone on the ocean. And I was by myself basically in my house and it was great like I didn't want to go out, It's not like I was like Etsy stuff and,
12:38:25 Yeah, I think I just go full moon.
12:38:31 Okay, so on a scale of one to 10 What would be your confidence level.
12:38:35 I think it would be like a solid nine as well. Okay.
12:38:41 Thank you.
12:38:41 It's good to get to the root, the root reason of why we think something might not happen. Wow you like me unpack that.
12:38:50 I'm glad. Huh, there's something there.
12:38:54 And I mean, in reality I want you to be successful, I want you to succeed so the goal is to set you up for success. Yeah. No, honestly, I think I need this because if I tell this to my friends like, Oh, we should all, it just doesn't work it's like the
12:39:08 blind leading the blind because we're all so I really appreciate this.
12:39:15 Yeah.
12:39:17 Oh my gosh, that is a wonderful image that you just leaving this line, and it's awesome.
12:39:25 Okay, see.
12:39:28 Any other thoughts that you have so we have two goals that you set for yourself.
12:39:34 And what am I going to do is I'll send you an email with a summary of those two goals.
12:39:41 And that way you can have something in writing to remind you about what your goals have been, I invite you to also write them down after we're done just so that you have them in your mind.
12:39:54 Put him somewhere where you can see them. That way you can you can track them.
12:40:00 You mentioned that you're a planner so I'm assuming you'll put it on your planner to try.
12:40:06 Yeah, I have a paper planner, because I also like writing but I have it. I'm also on my phone a lot.
12:40:11 So it's like a good reminder on my phone, and it pops up on my phone.
12:40:16 Good, good, good.
12:40:18 And I think that is most done by end unless you have any other questions. No, that was good. That was a good talk.
12:40:27 I guess I do have one more question and then turn that we're checking in every week.
12:40:31 Our Wednesdays at noon, a good time for you to meet for the next three weeks, or do you want to just set up next week and then next week we can revisit it for the following.
