08:59:30 Hi.
08:59:33 How's it going today.
08:59:35 I'm doing well. How are you good I feel the week just flew by. Yeah, it was going really fast, and it's very gloomy.
08:59:45 Yeah, I'm all bundled up this morning is cold here today. Hi.
08:59:52 Are you in the city to know I'm in San Jose, but it's cloud, it's a little cloudy and it just feels cold, and I woke up congested, Mike, what is this.
09:00:04 I know I'm like I thought it's brain.
09:00:09 Well thank you so much for joining me today.
09:00:13 And we'll, we'll jump into get started about how, how you. How's your week, and how did you do with your goals.
09:00:24 my week was pretty good.
09:00:27 Like we said it went by super fast.
09:00:32 Yeah, I just I stayed, I was pretty busy. Just classes and getting caught up on some homework and then also just like hanging out with my friends.
09:00:43 I did get to complete my goal. I went for two like probably like half hour walks, where I just kind of like didn't listen to any music or anything and just kind of like went on my own.
09:00:58 And those are really nice.
09:01:03 And for the second goal.
09:01:07 I, we had talked about just picking a recipe, which I sort of ended up making any recipe, like, it wasn't like it wasn't really easy recipe but I end up going like grocery shopping on Sunday, and then they had like these little pasta noodles are like
09:01:29 stuff that I never had before and I was like, This isn't good.
09:01:33 So I ended up getting that and like making pasta.
09:01:36 And I was like, new and I've never had it before and I don't have a lot of pasta either I like never make pasta somebody else like makes it for me.
09:01:45 It was fun.
09:01:46 It was good and then I and I actually like had it with my friend.
09:01:50 I like shared it with her.
09:01:53 So on a scale of one to 10, how would you rate your progress for this last week on your goal.
09:02:01 Good, I think like a nine.
09:02:05 And no, I think you did. You did great. He wanted to try a new recipe for you figure out a way to incorporate that grocery shopping gave you some ideas so that's very good times it's like a little challenging to get myself out for a walk.
09:02:22 Just because like when I run I do listen to music so I don't, I don't really count that one.
09:02:27 But till I get out for a walk so the other day on the bus, and I came back and I got, I got off the bus like another like 10 bucks for my stop, and I was just like, I just walked the rest of the way.
09:02:39 So that was kind of how I like squeezed it in. Yeah, I mean, and you have to, I think, you, you gotta find time where you're doing certain activities or finding time when there is none it can be a little tough right.
09:02:56 But if you're. Yeah, like getting off at an earlier stuff can can give you that extra time to, especially if you don't have to be somewhere too soon, then it gives me time Okay, I have this amount of time and I can walk.
09:03:14 How about your stress level for this last week, on a scale of one to 10 What would you say that,
09:03:25 probably
09:03:28 three.
09:03:31 Are you excited to be almost done.
09:03:36 Us, everything is really winding down we had our last like exam. And we don't have a final in the class of a class basically over yesterday.
09:03:46 Yeah, a lot of my other classes are really winding down there's not. No big projects or presentations left really.
09:03:57 Okay. And what are you hoping to check in about today is what has been on your mind for this week, or goals.
09:04:16 Maybe
09:04:19 I do like the goals I think they keep like my stress down.
09:04:26 So maybe like another kind of mind, full.
09:04:33 Go,
09:04:43 trying to think cuz you're, you're doing some mindfulness walking,
09:04:50 that has helped.
09:04:53 Have you done just meditation or mindful meditation on its own without walking in the journal, and then.
09:05:04 Yeah.
09:05:04 Maybe we could do that.
09:05:06 That's an idea. Do you have other ideas or other thoughts that you've been wondering about.
09:05:18 Sometimes I think I get like really caught up and like what I'm doing in the moment and like I don't make as much time for like certain people in my life who like are really important to me.
09:05:32 And I just feel like I mean like I haven't talked to them in forever like I feel like I'm being like a bad friend like I haven't reached out so maybe like something to make me make time for other people.
09:05:50 Are you thinking more around maybe calling a friend, or let's say, as you have your day schedule, maybe scheduling a break time where you, you would call a friend during that time
09:06:10 also thinking of. If you have their well even if you have their email address, because I was going to say maybe send them like a note by snail mail, we don't really use that as much anymore.
09:06:23 But even just like a quick email like hey how are you.
09:06:28 Are you going to text, you know.
09:06:31 Yeah, maybe I'll do that because yeah I am a big like lyst person like maybe I have to like kind of block it in. Yeah, yeah, that's what I what I recommend especially when because you're very organized and you know okay this is my day and this is what
09:06:47 I'm going to do. So I feel that if you schedule it into, like you said, an item on your list that you need to check off, then it's more likely to happen that way.
09:07:03 So you're thinking of connecting with one friend, or just backing up and actually scheduling time to connect with, with some.
09:07:18 I think we can go for just, like, blocking out time and connecting, like in the next week.
09:07:34 And, I mean, those are the types of things just like you mentioned sometimes we get caught up in what we do that we didn't forget about others.
09:07:57 to live let's get specific with those. So for for meditation or thinking more just mindful meditation.
09:08:09 That's not necessarily walking, but you could still do what you want to.
09:08:14 And how much time are you thinking for that, that you want to start with, with 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
09:08:24 Yeah, I think 10 or 15 minutes, or if it is like a longer one probably just do that like once, as opposed to a shorter on.
09:08:35 And are you thinking this will be something that you want to do in the morning, in the afternoon or evening.
09:08:43 Think like afternoons are good.
09:08:48 And how many days this.
09:08:52 Good.
09:08:56 Let's shoot for one.
09:09:10 Cuz I used to want to do the walking so
09:09:06 you're in the walking you're doing that twice during the week.
09:09:17 And then where you
09:09:27 see, and your confidence level, about, about the walking in the meditation that meditation.
09:09:33 Let's do an eight.
09:09:35 I think I'll get it done.
09:09:39 The other part that you mentioned was the meeting time so let's make that specific
09:09:50 much time would you want to carve out of your schedule to to connect with, with a friend.
09:09:59 Probably I want to try to call. So let's like an hour.
09:10:07 You want to do this on a specific day of the week, or just some time during this week for an hour. Don't do it. I think sometime during the week just haven't had a chance to like, look at my schedule.
09:10:24 And are you thinking of doing this in the morning, afternoon or evening.
09:10:32 Probably morning.
09:10:41 And how confident Do you feel
09:10:55 to seven. I think the important thing is to focus on the action itself that is to schedule the time and make that connection. Now whether the friend is available or not that's a whole other story, and we will cap that towards because I, I always, I mentioned
09:11:12 that because when we make any goal that's associated with someone else. And they may or may not want to be willing participant.
09:11:24 I said, That's right, you'll, you'll make the that what we're counting is that attempt that you're making it yours.
09:11:29 Okay.
09:11:31 Sounds good.
09:11:41 You mentioned that you're still wanting to do the Walking Dead Do you want me to list that one down as something that you'll continue or yeah anyway, without me.
09:11:45 I think having it as a goal like also motivates me to do it more like,
09:11:53 Do the walking meditation.
09:11:56 And that we said it was two times to me.
09:12:01 Remind me are you doing that in the afternoon as well.
09:12:05 Yes, afternoon,
09:12:10 and or 30 minutes.
09:12:14 Yes.
09:12:26 just helps us to know to set an a, an idea of when it'll happen, then it's more likely to happen. Yeah. Sometimes I go a little extra and I asked you to select a specific time.
09:12:40 I trust that you will.
09:12:43 Especially because you've been doing it so you have a regular schedule for this Yeah, and have confident, do you feel about continuing the walking meditation.
09:12:53 Probably nine.
09:13:03 So you mentioned a little bit earlier, some of the challenges that they had been a few challenges, whether what were some of the successes that you've had this last week with accomplishing your goals.
09:13:19 I think it really came down to timing, and like finding the time and just having extra time that I can spend on like, okay, like, I'll go for a walk or grocery shopping.
09:13:39 I would just kind of like have it in the back of my mind like I, I should try something new like I want to try something new.
09:13:50 So yeah.
09:13:52 And I think the same goes for challenges like it comes down to timing.
09:13:57 And like sometimes like losing motivation, if it's like cold outside and like, Misty like yesterday I, I went on a walk.
09:14:07 And it was early and it was really cold and it was really misty but my friend was like my friend is like dog sitting so she had to take this dog out like to the park and so I'm like okay like a block from my house and meet you there.
09:14:19 And so, that was like my 30 minute walk was like to get there and then when I had come back because she wasn't with me at that time but then we met and I was motivation.
09:14:30 Yeah and having a buddy can motivate us are making plans with someone to meet up just like you. You gave a great example of that.
09:14:41 They can push us to Okay, I need to go and do this, that also works for me I have to say that I meet with on Saturday so that we can go hiking, she lives like 30 minutes from here but I'll drive to see her, because I know I'm more likely to do it.
09:14:59 If I just say, and I also don't do hikes like that on my own just because of my own personal fears.
09:15:09 I want to live by myself.
09:15:10 So, having someone to do things with can can really keep that motivation going to gear, you're on to some, some good ideas there.
09:15:21 Okay.
09:15:24 And how about the messages. This week were there any messages that stood out to you.
09:15:32 You
09:15:36 and have any of them motivated you to to do something.
09:15:42 Oh, the one where it said take a break from computer and TV and get outside.
09:15:48 That one I was like okay,
09:15:53 because I did find myself like, I'll be on my phone just like laying in bed after like a class or something and I was like, I didn't want to get up.
09:16:01 But then I think I saw it and I was like, Okay, I'll go for a walk.
09:16:05 Okay, so he actually got up for a walk. I think I did I was like I have to, I got this much today like I have to call That's very nice. Yeah, sometimes this, we just need those little reminders.
09:16:21 That's very good.
09:16:23 Any others that stood out to you this week.
09:16:32 Oh I like the one with the little letter with the flowers coming out.
09:16:37 Okay.
09:16:44 On that when I should call a friend.
09:16:48 Maybe that sort of get an idea in your mind.
09:16:54 Maybe did subconsciously I remember to.
09:16:58 Yeah.
09:16:59 Yeah, I like those those ones.
09:17:05 See, any other items you want to check in about or things you that you've been thinking, I want to try today's session, three.
09:17:15 So we do have one more session so there's more items we can definitely discuss next week.
09:17:21 Okay.
09:17:22 And what happens after the four weeks is that just like the end of the like a pilot program. Yeah, so we are doing a pilot program that text, the text messages you receive will be for four weeks, and then the health coaching goes along with the with those
09:17:39 four weeks. So at the four week mark the messages will stop the text messages, and then next week will also be our, Our last week. And at that time schedule some time with you.
09:17:56 Because the rest of the team. We're also doing like a feedback interview. I don't do those because I always your health coach but someone else from, from the team will be meeting with you to just ask you about your experience in the program.
09:18:11 And that's also going to help us to further understand.
09:18:27 And that's also going to help us to further understand how we can improve improve our intervention or for other Latinas and other students in one by really fast, by really fast.
09:18:29 As I was thinking about that last night as I was sending reminders and just making my, my note, we make Wow.
09:18:38 So how do you make three.
09:18:41 So in, not coded times when we have met like on campus.
09:18:47 Okay. Yeah, that was the idea the goal for for this program, they would actually be in person. Um, so that would have been really, I know.
09:19:01 I sent out an email that they were like, opening up spots in the library.
09:19:05 I was looking for. We can have an in person graduation, but I was just being helpful.
09:19:10 Yeah, it might be too soon for this, may I don't know. Yeah.
09:19:17 Unless they decide to do something, of course outdoors and people are kept separate but then they're the families right you're inviting families, then that makes it a little bit difficult in my mind to think it is the way that I view graduations, now
09:19:35 a lot of people want to come.
09:19:38 A lot of people want to be there to support would be happy if it was just the students.
09:19:44 Me and my cohort like at least I get to like walk across something.
09:19:58 And like be handed my diploma not mailed.
09:19:59 Yeah.
09:20:00 Everyone would have to be
09:20:03 at least I would assume from the staff meeting vaccinated if they're going to like handing you things.
09:20:12 It's.
09:20:12 Everyone in the nursing department is pretty much vaccinated, I think, well, if, if there's a way that maybe you could email professors and start a little petition of can we have something.
09:20:25 if, if there's a way that maybe you could email professors and start a little petition of can we have something. And I know that there's been talks about, if not in May, maybe in the fall, they plan to do something for students that are graduating in
09:20:34 the fall, but also for previous classes I haven't been able to have an in person graduation, but I haven't heard any more updates about about that.
09:20:47 Yeah, I don't know, I think some people have already tried and the university was like, No, it's, it's a big risk.
09:20:55 Yeah.
09:20:58 Any other thoughts.
09:21:03 Now I don't think so. Or you have three goals that you're going to be working on for this week.
09:21:10 As always, I'll send you a summary about them.
09:21:14 I'm trying to think of an include a few recordings for meditation that you could do at home. So non walking meditation in local from this, maybe one were like, I don't know, I don't remember what time we put for that one but like a bedtime one might be
09:21:33 fun. Okay, yeah, I'll make a note of that.
09:21:37 So a bedtime meditation.
09:21:40 You can, yeah, yeah there's, There's lots of things out there. So, My something fun.
09:21:47 Thank you.
