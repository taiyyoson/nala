17:30:56 Oh, don't worry about it like a mind, it's like, and I was outside gardening look at my mouse I was like guys real quick I'm starting my new garden, since it's that time today.
17:31:12 And we started a little bit after the pandemic we decided to start a little garden. Yeah, but we're finding that the bugs, eat everything. Yeah. So we started some plants indoors, move them up there and hoping that they survive.
17:31:26 Mm hmm. Yeah, same I my mom actually I live with my parents.
17:31:31 And they were we try to do this composting. So we kept like putting a bunch of the veggies and fruit scraps, like a little bowl and then we just put it in the garden because everything dried out so I'm going to start over.
17:31:47 And today I was like, there's like a bunch of plants of something I don't know what the seeds are I don't know if it's cucumber, or zucchini, but I was taking them out and I'm going to start over.
17:31:58 So I was going to like, read about the era. And I was like, there's a lot like a lot, a lot I was like we're going to have the juice forever.
17:32:08 Oh, yeah.
17:32:09 Awesome.
17:32:10 Well thank you so much for being able to join me today.
17:32:15 I know you have a lot going on, I know you mentioned you also have class today.
17:32:22 Yes, it was a long class, but I was like thank goodness, I was like I need to go outside real quick because it was stressful.
17:32:33 Know My name is a ticket, and I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks.
17:32:38 So I want to give you just a quick introduction and overview but the program itself. And then we can transition into goal setting which is a part of the program itself.
17:32:50 Yeah. Does that sound.
17:32:51 Sounds good.
17:32:54 So first, as you might have noticed examine is is a two part intervention. We have the, the daily text messages that you're receiving.
17:33:03 And thank you for responding to to them, it's really helpful for us to know what you think about them.
17:33:08 The second part of that intervention is the health coaching so meeting with me once a week, or soon.
17:33:24 20 minutes minimum. If we need more time, we could be flexible, but at least 20 minutes so we can discuss goal setting.
17:33:26 We can talk about the text messages themselves, seeing if anything stood out to you, and also stress so we definitely want to ask you about stress and how you're feeling from week to week.
17:33:39 And between each week I'll follow up with you about your goals and how things are going just to see your progress throughout.
17:33:48 So if there are any questions that do come up that I feel might be outside of my scope of expertise, I will do my best to give you appropriate resources for that.
17:34:00 And as you notice, well this is a research study, we are collecting data. However, any specific conversations that we have will be kept confidential and all the data that we gather will be sort of piled up together and it will be more of an aggregate
17:34:17 data that we collect.
17:34:19 So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable.
17:34:25 And by the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around, problem solving goal setting as a way to empower you to manage your physical health, your mental well being and your spiritual.
17:34:39 So really want to thank you for choosing to participate.
17:34:42 We know that it can be quite a commitment for asking for four weeks of your life. So your participation will help us to determine whether this type of program or something that can benefit us letting us.
17:35:04 for two more students. Do you have questions before we get started.
17:35:07 So are you part of a program with USA.
17:35:11 I am a Master of Public Health. Okay. And at the moment at USF. And I am in my second year. So this is sort of part of my fieldwork assignment.
17:35:24 I work with Dr. Kelly L'Engle, to be able to develop the health coaching aspect of this intervention. And I also help with the development of the text messages themselves.
17:35:37 So putting together what messages you wanted to send.
17:35:43 Cool. Okay.
17:35:46 So you want to know about.
17:35:51 What was that, and you want me to share a little bit about me. Yes. Yes. Did you have any questions before we get started.
17:36:06 No, not really. I think that was just my only my question like, in what capacity, you're like affiliated with USF but that makes sense now. Yes, I'm a student.
17:36:15 So I'm also a graduate student at USF.
17:36:16 And I'm wrapping up my master's program for school psychology counseling, and I'm doing door credential so I can be a therapist in the future as well.
17:36:28 And I think what drew me to this was because it was like, in particular for Latinas, and I was like okay let's check this out. This means is probably going to be you know ran by Latina so I dig that.
17:36:42 So yeah I I come from a very big family where eight all my family is from Mexico.
17:36:51 Do you hear that music.
17:36:54 Okay, it's really loud.
17:36:58 It's just you're really good at. Okay, I'm playing this down because I just knew you ok cool so I just have to focus.
17:37:05 So, um yeah I grew up, my parents are from Mickey go my siblings I'm the youngest one all my siblings were also born in Mexico and so we have been eating traditional Mexican foods and I feel like I've always been very like self conscious about my body
17:37:23 because growing up I've always been on the bigger side compared to them. And so, I've always tried to be very mindful of like what I eat because diabetes does run in my family.
17:37:36 However, like, even when I lost significant amounts of weight, and I was, I did it in a healthy way, I was still sick. So, I think I you know through my own personal mental health journey I'm learning to like love my body and respect it.
17:37:51 But I also want to continue to be proactive and making healthy decisions.
17:37:55 Because when coven hey I did feel like I got a lot of like depression and anxiety around everything. So I did all I turned to a lot of binge eating I feel.
17:38:06 And so I'm kind of like, I don't do that anymore but I feel like I carry a lot of guilt because of it. And so one of my biggest goals and joining this program was to like get those reminders and be mindful about like you know keeping a healthy balance
17:38:27 between, you know my spirituality, my mental health and also what I'm consuming. One of the biggest things right now is like I want to keep my body moving a little bit more because I do work from home, half of the time.
17:38:42 So, I have, so I have an internship two internships. I work part time, I have my little hustle. I tutor on the side and then I'm a student. So I have a shitload of stuff excuse my language but I'm stressed out, and sometimes like when I'm like oh I want
17:38:57 to like work out or do Zuma or lift weights.
17:39:01 I'm just not there like I'm very exhausted and I kind of get myself a lot over it.
17:39:07 So it was really nice to see your text that you know it said to dance with family or go for a walk because I was like you're right like I don't have to do a whole as workout like I can just literally go for a walk so that was really nice.
17:39:20 But yeah, that's a little bit about me.
17:39:24 Yeah.
17:39:26 Thank you. Thank you so much for, for sharing that you brought up stressed and how at times.
17:39:34 There might be times where it gets overwhelming because you do have quite a bit going on for this last week, what would you say was your stress level on a scale of one, not so stress to 10, very stressed.
17:39:50 Um, this week was.
17:39:54 I want to say a nine.
17:39:57 This was the first week that I went on campus on my job. And so it was overwhelming. There's a lot of moving pieces, and I also got like triggered by something that came up in my own personal life that kind of made me kind of dip down a little.
17:40:16 Yeah, I would say it was a nine.
17:40:21 And every week I'll be asking you about about that just so we can record. We have a little skill though, we keep track of.
17:40:36 For sure. And you also mentioned quite a bit about your goals that you've set in the past, and that you've worked on for your help.
17:40:39 In thinking about that today and just having a baseline.
17:40:43 How, how are you doing and meeting those health goals on a scale of one to 10.
17:40:50 So I feel like when it comes to the eating.
17:40:53 I have been more mindful about eating more veggies more fruits.
17:40:59 Not as like not processed foods as much.
17:41:03 I've also tried my best to be a little bit more mindful about portions if I do eat like traditional Mexican foods that tends to be a little bit more, have a little bit more saw or a little bit more oil, things like that.
17:41:19 So, I feel like I've been okay I'll be honest, some weeks I feel like I've been pretty okay and some weeks I feel like I just don't like it.
17:41:33 Like it's hard to keep up because of my stress.
17:41:37 I turned to a lot of comfort foods when I'm stressed out, or I don't eat enough, and I snack a lot but it's not like healthy snacks.
17:41:47 So, it has to do a lot with my stress to be on this, to kind of an in between. Right. Yeah, I guess you can say an in between.
17:41:59 Yeah.
17:41:59 It just gives us a little baseline. So you mentioned also how there's things that you want to focus on.
17:42:07 I heard you want to keep moving. For example, especially right now during the pandemic.
17:42:13 but in thinking about goal setting.
17:42:16 One of the goals is for us to work together. And to think about what is a goal that you want to do. Each week to week, but we want to do it in a very specific way.
17:42:29 So we want to make sure that the goal that you choose is something that's specific that we're able to measure it, that it's attainable for you especially in thinking of everything else that you have going on.
17:42:42 Something that of course is relevant and there's going to be a time attached to it. So for example, we're meeting today Saturday. My hope is that we can meet meet on a weekly basis so we can meet again next Saturday, or a day that works best for you.
17:43:00 And then I can check back with you about how did you do with your role and our goal for the week.
17:43:06 Then I can check back with you about how did you do with your role and our goal for the week. Are you thinking that Saturday's might be the best time for us, and everything else that goes on during the week or.
17:43:17 Yes, I'm thinking Saturday's work. Yeah. Yeah. And we can keep this time. And I'll just make sure to look good on both of our calendars. That way, you know it's there.
17:43:36 Yeah.
17:43:33 And it also helps for that weekly check in, of, hey, how did you do have an engine will and setting up a new goal.
17:43:41 and setting up a new goal. It also helps so that we have the same amount of days between each week for you to work on, on that goal.
17:43:48 So what is something that you would want to focus on for this week. What are you thinking.
17:43:58 So I think for this week. I want to.
17:44:03 I used to like meditate, a lot like very consistently and they really helped me with my mental health.
17:44:09 So I want to make sure want to meditate, let's say, at least three times a week.
17:44:16 Is that specific enough, how long each time. I want to do at least 15 minutes.
17:44:27 15 minutes. Actually no, no, no, sorry, at least 10 minutes.
17:44:33 10 minutes.
17:44:34 I say everything that you say out loud just to do you can hear it.
17:44:39 I want you said for two minutes I was like wait a minute.
17:44:43 And I here with meditation you, especially if it's something that you've done before and you're getting back into it starting small and gradual is really good.
17:44:52 Although 10 minutes I think it's like a good chunk of time.
17:44:56 So you're thinking meditate, at least three times this week.
17:45:01 10 minutes the other part I would ask you is, are you going to do this and morning, the afternoon in the evening.
17:45:09 That's a tough one because it depends on how I feel that day. So like if I wake up energized, I usually go to my backyard and I have my tea and then I meditate.
17:45:22 But I also if I had a really long day and I couldn't wake up early enough like I'll do it in the evening.
17:45:28 So, would you want me to select a time,
17:45:33 a realistic time for you.
17:45:36 And the reason behind this is also to sort of create that habit. Because oftentimes we say all other when I have time. What if I didn't have time that.
17:45:47 Yeah, that's right.
17:45:48 Okay, so then Let's aim for morning time.
17:45:52 Morning. I feel morning it safe because if he if something happens or comes up, you still have the evening. Exactly, Yeah.
17:46:03 And you mentioned that you've meditated before so is there a specific resource you have for that or do you want me to send you a few recordings and ideas.
17:46:15 I'll use the calm app. Okay. Yeah, so I usually go on there and depending on like what I want to focus on for the day I also liked one of those.
17:46:29 No my pillow my whole thing.
17:46:38 Music calm app will help you to find sort of options on the types of meditation that that you could do.
17:46:44 And what is a way that you'll remind yourself to do this.
17:46:50 I have on the calm app I have reminders in the morning.
17:46:56 A reminder on.
17:47:02 How would you ensure that it's happening and that it gets done.
17:47:13 I'm not sure.
17:47:14 I usually do it if I tell myself like I really enjoy meditating so if I tell myself. I'm going to do it like I'll be able to to follow through with meditation, so being physically active though that sounds, that's.
17:47:30 we can, we can start to put it in your mind for them.
17:47:33 I think that's good. And then thinking about meditation and getting back into into this activity. Why do you say that is important to you mentioned a little bit about it before but why is it really important for you to focus on yeah I feel like it because
17:47:49 I have so much going on. I feel like it really helps me start my day feeling grounded. And
17:47:56 when I feel grounded, I feel like I'm more present. And so, I overthink a lot, and I have some anxieties around like
17:48:10 like not meeting expectations are not doing enough and so when I feel grounded and I'm present I'm able to feel a little bit more calm and in the moment instead of like thinking of oh my god I started this after that.
17:48:25 So that's why I enjoy it because I've noticed significantly when I meditate, how much more like how much better I feel throughout the week than when I don't meditate when I'm feeling like so stressful, like this week, I just meditated once or twice, And
17:48:40 I was so used to doing it every day.
17:48:44 So, hence why I had a number nine.
17:48:51 I'm glad that you do find that it helps and that there is something you use for those moments where things are sort of chaotic or going out of control and you have that way to sort of bring you back that's a very good skill to, to have you.
17:49:10 And in thinking about meditating, three times this week is there specific days that you think might be more feasible to do it than others, or do you want to keep that flexible.
17:49:26 I'll probably aim for Monday Wednesday Friday.
17:49:30 Because in the end, Tuesday.
17:49:33 Monday Wednesday Friday because Tuesday Thursday. I, in the morning, I either want to go for a walk or do Zumba.
17:49:42 So another part of why I joined this program was because I felt like I needed some accountability. And I feel like checking in, weekly is going to hold me accountable.
17:49:50 That's what I'm here for. Yes.
17:49:54 Before for this goal of meditation, what would you say is your confidence level about being able to achieve this goal on a scale of one that's of confidence and 10 very confident.
17:50:08 And then, you mentioned that it's something that you're already doing your sort of just wanting to maintain in.
17:50:17 Yeah.
17:50:19 And I also heard you talk about on Tuesdays and Thursdays you want to do something more physical, did you want to set up a separate goal for that.
17:50:28 Yes, good Yeah, because if not, I'm just going to go against all right.
17:50:33 Okay.
17:50:35 And you mentioned different types of activity. So I heard walking or soon but Are those the two that you want to focus on for this.
17:50:47 Let's do I wanted to jump ropes, jump ropes are walking, either or.
17:50:56 Okay,
17:51:06 how to spell folks.
17:51:07 Good.
17:51:08 So from jump rope or walking in how much time.
17:51:15 Um, how many repetitions especially for the rope part, or could be time since we're also talking yeah I feel like walking, probably an hour. I like to go to the like the marina or the Hayward shoreline I live in Hayward.
17:51:34 So far, like an hour, if I do jump rope, probably for like 30 minutes, I put music, I can do jump rope for a minute, like for a long time.
17:51:48 We have 30 minutes or an hour of walking.
17:51:53 How many days, would you do this.
17:51:56 I want to say I want to start off with two days.
17:52:02 And I heard earlier Tuesday or Thursday, are those you thinking yeah Tuesdays and Thursdays.
17:52:12 Is the magazine.
17:52:14 Oh sorry I was gonna ask Am I going to get a copy of this. Yeah.
17:52:19 What did I say, I'm your recorder, no worries. And at the end of the session before the end of the day, I'll send you an email summary with your goals.
17:52:29 And the reason why I was asking if you need it resources around meditation is I can also find recordings.
17:52:36 10 minute meditations, like YouTube videos that have, I've used or that others that I know have used and that way you have another option, you mentioned you have a calm app and that's very good resource I think you will be fine with the calm.
17:52:55 I guess I'll send you some. Okay, thank you.
17:52:58 So we have physical activity, jump rope 30 minutes walking our today's Tuesday Thursday. And is this something that you want to do in the morning, in the afternoon, that one would have to be in the afternoon,
17:53:16 evening, or in the evening.
17:53:19 In the afternoon to to eat me.
17:53:22 And I would just encourage you to, to think about a specific time. and we'll keep it, flexible, but the more specific that we tend to be with our goals and it becomes sort of like a set schedule, and then we're more likely to do it.
17:53:39 So for example if you say I'll do this, you know, at 6pm, then you can also add it to your calendar and that way you know Yeah, 6pm. This is my thing I'm going to do.
17:53:53 So I tutor by.
17:54:00 So I can do it at six.
17:54:05 I can say 6pm six to 6:15pm yourself some, Michael.
17:54:17 How confident, do you feel about your goal to do the physical activity, whether it's a jump rope for 30 minutes or the walking for an hour.
17:54:31 Then
17:54:31 you've got this is.
17:54:37 So what, what are some ways that you're going to remind yourself to do this one for the exercise for the app for the common meditation you mentioned the app could send you a reminder that physical activity so I have a little whiteboard calendar, next
17:54:51 to my door so I'm probably going to write, write it on there, put like a little box to check it.
17:54:58 I noticed that usually helps me but I stopped doing that, but I spent doing it again.
17:55:03 Yeah, so you swipe your calendar on the door.
17:55:07 And also mentioned that you can use that as sort of a checklist.
17:55:13 Visual reminders are good
17:55:18 also send you this reminder, so.
17:55:22 Oh yeah. Okay, thank you this team this email reminder only open it.
17:55:36 Yes, I will.
17:55:31 And then during the week. Typically I give you a few days to, you know, have had a chance to try some of these things. And I'll check in to see hey, how's your goal going to get during that week, and I typically do that through text so the same way you're
17:55:50 getting the messages I can respond to those messages are sending message. Wasn't sure that was like the automatic message system where like you can't reply to it.
17:56:00 So when you responded with like, I forgot exactly what you said but when you respond to something I was like okay nevermind, you have access to respond back yeah I have, I have access to respond and I continue can respond, and I can see your responses.
17:56:15 So each of the health coaches that have participants, we can assign each participant to the specific health coach. So some messages are automated like the daily messages that you get at like 930 in the morning.
17:56:29 Those are automatic messages that you get for the program.
17:56:33 And then I can reply. If you have questions or if you have comments about them I can follow. Okay.
17:56:43 Yeah, it's really helpful when, when you respond because I kind of also tells me like what you're thinking. Or if you're able to put them into practice and you let me know.
17:56:52 I really like it because then it gives me a little bit of insight of how your day is going, that you're up to.
17:56:59 So I appreciate it. When I get a little thing.
17:57:04 Okay, so I'll respond. Yeah, it's wonderful.
17:57:09 So we have two goals, how are you feeling Do you feel you need a third. Do you think you're good with these two to start with.
17:57:17 Let's just keep it with these two for now and then we'll see how it goes. Yeah.
17:57:23 I think these are great goals that you have for this first week, and there it's a very, very good start to start making those habits and changes.
17:57:35 When we come back a little bit to the messages.
17:57:39 I know that you mentioned there was a message this week that talked about dancing with family, and that that stood out to you kinda reminded you that physical activity can be done in a lot of different ways.
17:57:51 We don't go to the gym to do physical activity.
17:57:57 Were there other messages that stood out to you.
17:58:00 I don't have my phone on me right now because I lifted in the backyard I have the music for my mom's.
17:58:08 I do remember the fruits and veggies one. And then when you send me that document that kind of gave me because I'm a visual learner. So when you sent me the document with the pictures that was really helpful as well.
17:58:21 And then the meditation one like make sure like make some time for that. I was like done.
17:58:30 Yeah, I like, I like them in general, to be honest with you, they're really nice reminders.
17:58:35 Yes. Yeah. So let me ask you a little bit more about the meditation you mentioned the meditation, then you actually meditated after that.
17:58:44 No, I had already meditated. Ah, yeah.
17:58:49 Yeah.
17:58:51 Because I was like, So when I signed up for this program, kind of like boost like turned on the gears of like girl dust off everything is time to make it happen again.
17:59:04 You know, I started to slowly like do things again. And then I'll say maybe this is going to help me you know hold me accountable and like hype me up at the same time.
17:59:12 And that's really the goal. Now when you think about like where are especially during this time, we actually did not intend for this intervention to happen around this time.
17:59:23 And at the same time, we're kind of glad that it did because he would have provide each other with that little extra support that we wouldn't have otherwise during the same time.
17:59:33 Yes, no, I really appreciate this and I hope there's a lot of more people taking advantage of this
17:59:42 thing can be helpful.
17:59:45 Okay. I think that's it that's a good amount of feedback for for the messages so don't worry about not not having your phone or anything. And in general, I think I'm looking more to see.
17:59:58 Was there a message that stood out in terms of like, Oh yeah, I'm going to go do that, and you actually had already done it and then it you're like, Oh, I already did that.
18:00:06 So I think that's that's really good feedback for us. Well, tell you about you. Yeah, I'll tell you that the veggies and fruit one, that one did kind of encourage me I'm like all right let me go get an orange, because I haven't really been consuming a
18:00:23 lot of veggies and fruits.
18:00:27 So that one did kind of like push me to go get a fruit.
18:00:35 That's awesome. I'm glad that you're finding the reminders useful, and that's one of the things that we also realized as we develop messages that a lot of them are, it's nothing revolutionary.
18:00:47 Oh my gosh, I really needed this information is more of like, Oh, yeah, I really should do that right it's more of like a gentle reminder of the important things are the things that we can do to take care of ourselves.
18:01:00 Yeah, that's how we like to, to see it.
18:01:04 Yeah, that's how it's going. So far, good, I'm good.
18:01:08 So we have two goals, did some feedback. Anything else that you want to share or bring up today.
18:01:16 As I mentioned, we're going to be meeting weekly. So next week we'll check in about how you did. And then we can talk about how things are going and any barriers that might have come up, and then also either modify what we're working on, or make a new
18:01:32 goal. So depending on where you are and where you want to go with.
18:01:39 I think the only question that comes up for me is like how flexible Are you in terms of like the meeting times. Do you want to set a scheduled time like for the rest of the sessions are you flexible, because some of my classes when I switch classes, we
18:01:54 alternate with the other cohort and so I'll be ending at a different time. And then one of the Saturdays, two of the Saturdays I completely already have, like, like my parents are going to do a little graduation.
18:02:08 Nice I probably won't be available.
18:02:11 I'm flexible. So let's do this. Are you available next Saturday at 530 next Saturday yeah I should be because this is the last day of that, that class.
18:02:21 Okay, so how about we do this, let's schedule the next one. And then next Saturday we can reverse it what will be the next, the best time for us to meet the following me.
18:02:44 Yeah, that sounds good, and it can be it can be on a weekday weekdays, mostly evenings or during lunch time because I work eight to five. Or we could do really early, but really early. am I know before you know.
18:02:53 Am I not before you know. And we can next Saturday we can look at session three and one but what happened.
18:02:59 Yeah, that works.
18:03:01 I know that I just remember it, you mentioned something about the portion for fruits and vegetables. So the, the link for the document help, or did you have more questions about portions for fruits and vegetables.
18:03:16 I says, I think the
18:03:20 little picture that because it said the portion and there's a picture right next to it that was helpful for me. So then I kind of like, have the opportunity to think like okay, I can have it this way I could have it that way.
18:03:32 Because I was I wouldn't even mean like.
18:03:37 It was a semi. Yeah. Yet, it just means, so they're serving as what we use to measure the nutritional value of the food.
18:03:46 Typically we have a say in it. So that's the the serving size the portion is what we actually eat. So let's say we always like to use the example of rice because I think it's just like, easier conceptually, but when you think about it, a serving of rice
18:04:03 is the third of a cup. And that's the amount they used to do the nutritional value so that tells you that they would have a cup of rice has x amount of carbohydrates, X amount of protein.
18:04:15 By the way, it has 15 grams of carbohydrate.
18:04:36 Mike is gonna go ahead and then let's say I decide to consume, my portion that I want to have is a cup.
18:04:27 So if I have a cup of rice, then that means I'm eating three servings.
18:04:33 Right, because the serving size is one third. Oh, got it. Yeah, and that's when it goes to, like, Okay, got it. I didn't even know that, is that how much we're supposed to be eating.
18:04:43 So that's the trick question that sometimes people think, oh, then I should only be eating a third of a cup.
18:04:50 It's to help you plan your meals, if you want to eat.
18:04:54 You can eat a cup, you just gotta be careful what else you eat within right now, especially for someone with diabetes and this is very specific or someone with pre diabetes, they need to watch their carbohydrates.
18:05:09 So then if they're already having 45 grams of carbohydrates in a cup of rice. Then there's usually a range of, like, 45 to 60 grams per meal. So then you're all already getting close to that max.
18:05:22 Okay, I'm going to share that with my parents too because they're pre diabetic.
18:05:29 And, yeah, so it's not about, Oh you then you should only eat a third.
18:05:34 It's more of us that one third to to guide you how much you're actually eating to know the full nutritional content of the food that you're hurting. Yeah.
18:05:46 And a good, a good like visual, it's, it should be a third of a cup it's maybe like the size of your fist.
18:05:57 And I think for fruit. It depends on the type of fruit. I know a serving of fruit, could be like actually half of the fruit.
18:06:08 But if you decide to eat the whole fruit then you just know you're eating two servings rather than one server name.
18:06:15 So those little things. I like that graphic I send you because it also show you specifically for route. The serving if it's raw, if it's dried up and saw that.
18:06:26 Yeah, yeah.
18:06:28 And then, like, the different types of vegetables Yeah, he greens and not as we feel.
18:06:34 Yeah, I remember that.
18:06:36 Okay okay this is good information.
18:06:40 Yeah, I get the sense that sometimes people forgot and think, oh, but that's very little for me to you to me.
18:06:47 It's just a serving is to help you plan your meals, it's not the amount that you should eat some people eat more than a serving and some people eat less than a serving.
18:06:57 It's really what we choose. But the important thing is that we know how much work.
18:07:02 Okay, that makes sense.
18:07:06 Well, that's my skill. So, let me tell you.
18:07:13 We have more questions. Okay.
18:07:17 I'm trying to think of what resources I can send you this week because you have the information for meditation.
18:07:25 Is it okay if I ask you questions through the tux. Yeah. Okay, question. Yeah, anything that you that's going through your mouth of mine, you can ask me questions through text, and also when I type up this message and I send it to you if a question comes
18:07:43 up and you want to reply via email. You can also do that.
18:07:47 Whichever you find is more most useful.
18:07:54 Okay, sounds good.
18:07:55 Usually, either or, it'll take me a little bit of time to reply, I want to make sure that I provide you with a good resource then I would find useful and, hopefully, No worries.
