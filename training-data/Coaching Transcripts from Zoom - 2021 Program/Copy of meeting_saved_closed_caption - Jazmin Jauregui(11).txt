19:16:27 Hello.
19:16:28 Hi. Hey, I just texted you, So you can ignore that message.
19:16:35 Yeah, sorry it took me like, it takes me time sometimes to find like the emails and then to figure out which one a year.
19:16:42 Oh yeah, no worries.
19:16:44 I just, yeah sometimes the Google Calendar.
19:16:49 The Zoom link seems kind of hidden, so I texted it over to you but you're on here so just ignore that message and it's nice to see you.
19:17:00 So, one just like Hi my name is Jasmine and thank you so much for joining me.
19:17:08 I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks.
19:17:13 And I'll be giving you a kind of like a quick little introduction and then we're going to transition to like the health coaching part does that sound okay.
19:17:19 Yeah, that sounds good. Okay, cool.
19:17:22 Um, so firstly examine is a two part intervention.
19:17:27 One aspect is the health and wellness text messages which you should have started receiving.
19:17:33 Okay.
19:17:34 And then the second aspect is the health coaching health coaching, sorry that's another word, which is what we're doing now.
19:17:43 And my role as your health coach will meet about once a week for about 20 minutes.
19:17:51 I'm open to meeting a little longer, and so to, if that happens just, or if you're interested, let me know. and we can adjust our time.
19:18:00 But during this time we'll check in about the daily text messages, your weekly health goal, and your stress level. So, in addition to like our zoom sessions.
19:18:12 I'll text you just to check in about how you're doing in meeting your health goal and if you need any additional support.
19:18:21 With that being said, if any questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise. I'll let you know about the limitations and my knowledge, and then can help you get connected to the appropriate resource.
19:18:35 So one example of this could be like, maybe you're like, you're interested in pursuing therapy as part of like your mental health goal. Unfortunately, I'm not a therapist.
19:18:48 So, I'll let you know like, hey, I'd like to provide the support but it's outside of my role, but there's caps here to help you.
19:18:58 And then just slightly transitioning to, like, this being a research study, we will be collecting data, but our specific conversations will be kept confidential.
19:19:10 and at the data will be de identified, meaning your name will not be associated with, like the notes that I take, it's all kind of scattered. So hopefully you feel comfortable with that.
19:19:25 And also just share as much or as little as you'd like. Don't feel obligated to share more than you're not comfortable with.
19:19:34 But overall, by the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting specifically as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual mental and physical health.
19:19:49 And then, of course, just thank you so much. We really appreciate your participation.
19:19:55 I'm kind of outside of this.
19:19:58 Your participation is helping us identify whether this is a perfect students want, or that they need and whether we can offer it to a large scale at a large scale.
19:20:09 So, your participation is helping with all of that.
19:20:12 Sounds good. Yeah.
19:20:15 So that's why I would like this and serious, but thank you.
19:20:20 That's the end of my introduction. Do you have any questions before we get started, I know, we kind of touched on everything. So, yeah, if any other questions come up, please feel free to ask anything.
19:20:39 Cool.
19:20:40 Um, so, one question that I'll be asking pretty routinely is around the health messages that you're receiving.
19:20:51 I know you've only got in a few but what are your first impressions of them, and have they motivated you towards setting any health goals.
19:21:01 Yeah, like they're actually pretty helpful especially because you know sometimes after work you feel stressed, and you kind of, sometimes it's easier to just kind of like layer around and do nothing but then it kind of like doesn't help alleviate the
19:21:18 stress as much, especially because like aren't really energetic person.
19:21:22 So I appreciate it when I got the message about, oh do at least 30 minutes of working now and I'm like, Yeah, I probably could go for a jog or do something to get my self moving.
19:21:35 Mm hmm. So, it's just good little reminders, especially like with the fruits and vegetables because I have no problem eating a lot of fruit, it's the vegetables that are a little bit harder just because they're not as sweet, sweet.
19:21:54 So it's like, um, okay, vegetables have to be included.
19:21:55 Yeah.
19:21:58 Interesting. Yeah.
19:21:58 I think you. I agree with everything you said like feeling stress and all we want to do is like curl up in bed but we know being physically active can help us manage our stress.
19:22:12 So if you're interested, we can definitely develop health goals around that, as well as, like increasing your vegetable intake.
19:22:23 I don't want to like overwhelm you and, like, you don't have to do two goals, we can stick to one but these are good starting points, and if they're important to you, then you'll know you can you can achieve them.
19:22:38 You did talk about stress and I do have a stress question for you. Okay. Um, and so on a scale of one to 10, where one is like not stressed and like 10 is like super stress.
19:22:52 What's your stress level but like this week.
19:22:57 It kind of fluctuates between, like,
19:23:03 or to like seven, depending on like what I'm doing at work and also like the other things I'm thinking about because I'm trying to also see if I can move back to San Francisco.
19:23:19 And so I'm looking at, of course, look for places we have to make sure you have a job first to pay for those places. And so I kind of have to juggle that along with I still take like at least a class at USF.
19:23:34 Just to like get my degree out of the way.
19:23:37 And then the stress at work is more like I'm I barely started. So I'm still kind of new at it even though I've been trained but sometimes I come across things that I'm unfamiliar with.
19:23:55 And sometimes the my coworker is also pretty new like she started in January, but some of the things she hasn't heard about either like the different things I have to order like the scans and then sometimes what the doctor talks about with the patients,
19:24:11 I'm unfamiliar with and she's also familiar with so it's kind of like, oh, who can we ask so it's kind of just having to navigate and figure it out eventually.
19:24:22 Yeah, what do you what is it that you do a medical scribe so whatever the patient talks about I dictate it, and then whatever the doctor does is their diagnosis, and then he has PhDs under him, and students that are either do medical students or student
19:24:41 PhDs.
19:24:41 And so they'll also have me dictate for them. And I order like scans for people like MICT X ray and then also different labs that people have to do, and in other cases on if they have to have different monitor monitoring systems.
19:25:01 And then of course ordering medication.
19:25:03 A lot of them are like elderly patients and on your elderly tend to have more health issues.
19:25:09 So that's also why it gets pretty busy with orders and stuff like yeah and I can anticipate working in the medical field, high stress.
19:25:21 Especially because right now.
19:25:23 He's concerned with this third wave that he feels is going to come in, and it's going to be with the younger patients. So, so far we have had patients that have symptoms of covert but he automatically just has them be in the car, or over the phone.
19:25:42 He never brings them into the clinic.
19:25:44 So he's like just trying to stay proactive with that. But again, I had to dictate everything and yet to keep track of them.
19:25:54 Yeah.
19:25:54 Well, you do good work and I can imagine it being stressful.
19:26:00 And you also mentioned, wanting to move back to San Francisco or move to San Francisco, where are you currently are now back at home and Atkins Texas, it's a little bit outside of the city of San Antonio.
19:26:17 Wow, you're like in Texas. Yeah, that's why when you mentioned, like you mentioned the times my brain was like, oh, like step, like you know Central Time Zone and then I thought about I was like, wait, and then I saw that it said specific and the Little
19:26:31 princes and I was like, oh I keep forgetting that I'm not there anymore, because I had gotten so used to being a Pacific time so sometimes when I'm back here I'm like oh I got time.
19:26:59 I think like my first week, being back home from California had a dental appointment. And it was at 10. And it was, I should have been leaving already at that time I was like, Oh, it's 10 like I'm fine like you know another two more hours and I was like, wait, wait, way I'm totally off
19:27:13 Oh this is bad.
19:27:15 I know, and honestly, it's it's totally fine. I'm like our perspective, like, I apologize for not knowing the time zone. we had a participant one time.
19:27:29 Do like they were living in like Spain or something. And they were like not getting or text messages and we're like, why aren't you getting your text messages and she's like oh I'm in Spain, or like, oh okay so we have to take account like, you know,
19:27:45 those, and the time. So, we, we need to ask a question on the survey about time zones.
19:27:56 Um, and, and you also said you were you taking classes at USF, are you doing undergrad graduate, what are you studying.
19:28:10 Oh, this is to finish my undergraduate last last semester I made a, I made a mistake of not making
19:28:15 sure I took the, like, the enough classes I thought oh I'm fine with just these three because I thought I finished. Turns out and it's actually still take the four classes so I missed one class.
19:28:26 So I'm taking that one class now which is a neurobiology.
19:28:29 Yeah, I still have one like walk the stage I just haven't gotten my diploma yet because I need just one class so it's like frustrating but lessons learned.
19:28:40 Yeah, definitely. Having a good relationship with your advisor and helping them, ensure you're on track.
19:28:50 So, are you going into the medical field yourself.
19:28:54 I want to eventually Yes, I'm gonna have to be taking extra some extra classes, just to make brain GPA more competitive. And then also just to get more of the recommended classes because I want to do do medical school, versus MD, because I, I like to
19:29:14 more than the MD philosophy. Just do is about kind of how your whole body is connected. So, versus like MD is kind of like, oh it's hurts in this one area so let's look at only this area, do is kind of just like, oh, what is that off the connected to,
19:29:34 like, they tend to ask more about like your mental because maybe that's affecting something, you know, just like other areas of your body could also be hurting, and it's just not showing up in either.
19:29:48 Mm hmm.
19:29:48 Yeah, some so many things are connected to our mental health, like our mental health and our physical health are connected, even though we want to see them as two different things.
19:29:59 Yeah. Well, congratulations on one like graduating, like even they just have this one class on show you're rocking it, and you're, you're getting that experience to that can help you be a good applicant.
19:30:15 So, props to you.
19:30:17 Thank you.
19:30:17 I'm.
19:30:21 So,
19:30:22 in terms of like this program and how we can like work together. What were your main motivations in participating.
19:30:34 So, For me, like, so it's kind of like goes tied back to like my freshman year of college. So, you know, when you're a freshman in college I was called like the college 15 because like you just gained like wait.
19:30:45 So like for me like in high school and and even as a kid I was never allowed to like eat certain like sugary foods or processed foods because my parents were like, no, don't don't eat that like it was really fresh.
19:30:58 So when I finally got to college, I was like, I can't let stuff. Why gain a lot of weight, and then the issue was that I was always used to continuously working out because I did sports in high school, and even in middle school.
19:31:11 So I realized I didn't have sports to balance out my eating like I did before.
19:31:18 So since then it's kind of like, been a journey of just kind of like getting back into shape, like how I was like, I guess now more recently because I've been getting busier now that I started work and I would start working like in the past years also
19:31:34 also after freshman year, it's a little bit harder to maintain like continuously working out because it tired you don't feel like waking up so early because you're also tired from classes.
19:31:46 And then now it's kind of just like with code I feel like more like sluggish. Just because everything seems to be going really slowly and everything's all online it's like, it's a little bit harder to get out sometimes.
19:32:03 So that's why I wanted to do this because I was like, Oh, it'd be a good way of just like getting an extra reminder from, like, you know, besides myself just like, do something.
19:32:18 That way I can stick with working out continuously because I start doing it and then I have trouble following through with it because then I get it really
19:32:25 know.
19:32:27 I wonder too if like how you're saying the current situation the current status of our world is impacting your energy and motivation or determination to continue with the, with the goal that you've set for yourself.
19:32:46 So tell me a little bit about, like, the goal that you did have, for example, you mentioned like you were working out. Like What Did that include for you.
19:33:01 For me, it was just a way to also just get stress I'm a very physical person like I had to do something in order to really have one my stress and then also like any anxiety.
19:33:17 And so, like my main goal is just to like be more active in general, like whether that's, you know, doing more actual physical working out or you know have a set routine of with I do like certain workout, or even just to like get more outside and wander
19:33:37 around the yard, like my dad.
19:33:41 He literally put on his to do this walk around and I'm like why do you put that he's like because you have to always walk around a little bit.
19:33:48 So he literally like get up from his like workstation and whole just walk around the whole yard, like about times and then we'll come back in and go back to type in a way, it's like check.
19:34:02 Yeah.
19:34:02 It's like check. Yeah, like when he puts it in there twice. Okay, make sure that he goes multiple times. So I've started recently doing that too, because like you know like it's been inside sometimes you don't get that natural sunlight.
19:34:13 And then when you go outside you kind of like, oh the sunlight kind of makes me feel a little bit happier.
19:34:19 Vitamin D. It's a thing. Yeah, like I kind of didn't really believe it as often and then now that I'm like oh I was just really there was really helpful.
19:34:30 Pick this up and missing. Yeah.
19:34:33 Okay, cool. And so I'm hearing a couple ideas and I'm just going to reflect that back to you and you let me know whether you want to create one goal or two goals around the things that you've mentioned.
19:34:48 So I've heard that like being physical helps you alleviate some of your stress and some of your anxiety, and then you've faced some challenges before and keeping the routine.
19:35:05 But it's still important to you to like, maybe do something around there. And then I'm also hearing that like being outside or going for a walk outside can be something that you need in your life and want to incorporate just even a little bit of sun makes
19:35:25 you so much happier like that's powerful stuff.
19:35:26 So, and then also earlier you had mentioned around eating more vegetables and, like, I'm hearing a lot about physical activity. So, what do you want to set a goal around, either of those things, any of those things.
19:35:41 All of those things like i like i like the idea of both just to like, also help with my eating because like that's also a big part of like, making sure that you feel good when you work out.
19:35:54 Okay.
19:35:54 Yeah.
19:35:56 So, let me tell you a little bit about the way that I format, the goals, and then you can tell me kind of fill in the blank. So, we, we use the approach of smart goals which stands for specific, measurable, attainable relevant and timely for this program,
19:36:17 we keep the timely part two a week. So in a week, I will.
19:36:22 And then you want to be specific, go on a 10 minute bike ride for three of the four or three of the five days, or four or five out of the seven days so that's just one example.
19:36:36 And so even if you say like I'm going to exercise, I'd want us to be more specific, for example, I'm going to go on a 20 minute run, or I'm going to lift weights.
19:36:50 Three times, do three reps with 10 pounds like make it as specific as possible, and then.
19:36:59 So, yeah, I'm just gonna.
19:37:04 So Specific, Measurable, Attainable relevant and timely.
19:37:13 Okay.
19:37:11 Hit me with it what what does that
19:37:23 Specifically would be to go for a two mile run
19:37:37 at least three times out of the week.
19:37:45 was the third thing you mentioned.
19:37:48 And I think you nailed it. So, so far I kind of messed up.
19:37:53 So, in the next week.
19:37:59 Next week, you will go on a two mile run for her on three of the seven days.
19:38:25 in the evening on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday, Wednesday and Friday.
19:38:28 We can be that specific if it's helpful to you. But if you want that flexibility. That's okay.
19:38:36 I like the flexibility because sometimes like it just changes how I feel that day. Like, if I feel more sluggish. I don't do runs, I'll just kind of like we have a treadmill so I'll kind of like walk.
19:38:51 And then I'll do weights because that's more like stationary.
19:38:58 So, what this goal though you've made it really specific, and now you're going to go on a two mile run.
19:39:06 Yeah.
19:39:07 So, three days, so I was, yeah. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturday mornings.
19:39:13 Okay.
19:39:17 Cuz wednesday friday work.
19:39:24 So we, like I said, we do try to be specific with the health goals, because then you can also plan.
19:39:32 So, block, like if you use Google Calendar. Or, no you. You mentioned your dad users reminders. So like you wouldn't want to set those reminders for you, either.
19:39:44 The time before, is that are those tools helpful to you, like, Yeah, um what I used to do and I still do it actually any I need a bio markers you just reminded me, but I'm dry erase my marriage, and my restroom.
19:40:01 So, what I have things to do. I write them on my mirror, cuz you know you go to the restroom constantly looking for different.
19:40:09 It's always right there because it reminds me. So, okay, I'll start doing that also again, because I had stopped doing that.
19:40:19 Mm hmm. Okay.
19:40:22 So, I will let you remind yourself to buy those mirrors and write it on, on your mayor. So, by the dry erase so that you can write it on your mirror it.
19:40:36 So, let me think I'm.
19:40:41 One way to help make sure that this is a good, good SMART goal is to look at how confident you are in meeting this goal.
19:40:52 So I'm just going to like repeat it back to you so that you can tell me. On a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level, and one is like low confidence and 10 is high confidence.
19:41:04 So, in the next week you will go on a two mile run on three of the seven days, specifically, I'll say Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday.
19:41:25 So that it is a nine.
19:41:25 That's really good. Okay, cool.
19:41:24 Um, so, are there any other like resources or tools that you need to help you meet your goal.
19:41:37 No, like not I can't think of any.
19:41:42 Okay.
19:41:42 Yeah.
19:41:55 And so that hopefully that is helpful in like just checking in.
19:42:00 Now, just to
19:42:04 circle back to why this is important to you so hitting that relevant piece. What is going on a two mile run do for you. Why is it important to you.
19:42:17 It gets back my endurance, and then also my stamina.
19:42:24 Like, it's just also important for me to just get back into the swing of things like that because it's, it's also a really easy way to just like workout, the side like doing weights and other other stuff like.
19:42:49 Yeah. And something that you mentioned earlier too right like it helps alleviate your stress and anxiety, which I think we all can use a little more.
19:43:00 Cool.
19:43:02 Um, let's see.
19:43:05 Okay.
19:43:07 I think it's okay with you we can transition to your second goal, which was around a healthy eating.
19:43:17 So similar to the first kind of format, and the next week, you will, or I will. And then how would you like to fill in the blank.
19:43:32 And then next week.
19:43:42 I will
19:43:42 only.
19:43:45 Let us.
19:43:46 How do I work this.
19:43:49 I think if you some suggestions if needed.
19:43:52 I, because like I tend to like, um, because it's easy just to pick up fast food, and I know I shouldn't be. I should be cooking more because like I have everything at home it's just like, I want to like do that.
19:44:05 I know I have to so if I'm like, oh, like, I guess in the next coming week only pick up like fast food, once a week.
19:44:16 Like my usual which is I typically tend to do it three to four times because I get lazy and I shouldn't do.
19:44:23 Especially because I do have healthier foods at home and that's what also helps me eat more vegetables because they're right there.
19:44:31 Okay.
19:44:33 So, you will limit your consumption of fast food to one time.
19:44:39 Yes.
19:44:41 Okay.
19:44:53 So, one time.
19:44:56 Okay.
19:45:01 I guess one kind of scenario I can imagine is on those long days.
19:45:10 I'm like, say you ate fast food on Monday, and here comes Tuesday and you're like, oh man oh man oh man.
19:45:18 I really want to get some fast food.
19:45:21 What would you like, what would you like the game plan to be in that situation, like, like, what can you tell yourself, or maybe you like how can you hold yourself accountable in that moment.
19:45:37 Hello, when I was in San Francisco I just had my wallet for myself.
19:45:46 I had a roommate do that for me once I was just like take this and like put it somewhere I won't think about looking for it and she does just that, on the issue being is that ended up having to buy groceries, and she was at work and I couldn't so that
19:46:00 that was, that was the end of that plan.
19:46:02 Um, but
19:46:06 guess what I could do is just because sometimes I work.
19:46:11 They also feed us.
19:46:14 So honestly and they normally give us like a portion of solid so high, like, or like they'll also bring fruit.
19:46:22 And just like to have a snacks for us.
19:46:25 So I guess in that situation. I'll probably just take whatever's left over of the fruit, and then just like munch on that.
19:46:34 Or I should. Yeah. Better I'll just remind like make myself healthy snacks and I'll make sure that I keep them with me at work, and that way after work I can just like, munch on that instead of like getting,
19:46:50 like, like we're going. So, kind of, surrounding yourself with healthy snacks.
19:46:58 Also crunch person so that's also makes it hard for like certain vegetables because vegetables aren't always crunchy.
19:47:06 When I don't, I don't really like celery either and I know that's like a good crunchy want to have but it's I don't know I can't get past the taste of bitter.
19:47:17 Yeah, I'm not a big seller either but I do like carrots and cucumber.
19:47:23 Those are other.
19:47:24 Yeah.
19:47:26 I'm not sure if there's a trader joes in your area but they have like these, like small Persian cucumbers. They're kind of like the size of a pickle, but they're missing them yeah like they, yeah.
19:47:42 They come in like a big pack. Yeah. Yeah. So, and the cool thing about these is that the skin isn't better. And so you can really just like by, you can actually eat.
19:47:49 I didn't know that. Yeah.
19:47:51 Yeah, something, something to throw out there and give it a try if you want.
19:47:56 Huh. Okay, let me know that because I didn't realize, I always think they're better so that's why I try to peel them. That's good.
19:48:03 And skipped a step.
19:48:06 Yeah. Cool.
19:48:08 Um, one other thing that I'll just throw out there as an option is you can text me and say like jasmine, I'm really wanting fast food today, and I'd be like, no.
19:48:23 Can you wait till you get home, or like, Is there a banana available is there, cucumber available, so you can always use me as a resource is my point there, because sometimes I tell my other friends but they're also just as tired and craving stuff as
19:48:38 I am so when I get this and like, Oh, go for it like I'm craving the same thing I'm going to do it too and I'm like okay you're right, I'll do it to
19:48:49 that other opposite that's like, don't do it it's like okay you're right I needed your rights.
19:48:55 Cool. I'll be here, I'll be here that'll help me too.
19:49:00 So, to hit that like relevant piece.
19:49:05 And I know I'm sorry for like the repeated question but like, why is this goal important to you.
19:49:15 Cuz I believe that when you eat stuff that's fresher, you tend to feel better, or there was like a week, like to think my sophomore year I ate nothing but like fast food, and then I got tired of fast food.
19:49:33 fresh like I never craved such freshness and then after I did I felt amazing. And I'm like, oh, and I was like I'm starting to see why I need to start adding in more fresh either vegetables, fruits or just even like at fresh anything, taste, I don't know
19:49:53 better and it made me feel more energized.
19:49:57 So I know about. I know that's why I need to do it and it's always good to remind yourself like no it does make you feel better. It's like it does.
19:50:06 Yeah, totally. So like, and this is where you want like to live your life you want to live your life, feeling good and feeling energized. And I don't know there's like the exact details but you're taking neurobiology, and I'm sure there's loads of science,
19:50:27 I'd say like five vitamins and minerals and like all those nutrients are important to you and how they relate to your mental health so like I wonder if like grounding yourself in those beliefs as well can help.
19:50:41 Okay. Cool. All right. Sorry, another repeated question on the scale of one to 10. What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
19:50:52 This is more like a, like an 8.5.
19:50:56 Okay.
19:50:58 Like slowly, but I know like it's going to get a little bit challenging when like that scenario brought up because I happen to live.
19:51:05 That's a very real thing like thank you for bringing that up because I'm like that's that's a really good point you make, I forget about those little, little moments.

19:51:41 Yes.
19:51:43 And then, let me say it, there's.
19:51:49 And then your first goal is in the next week, you'll go on a two mile run on three of the seven days specifically Saturday Tuesday and Thursday.
