19:36:11 Okay, cool. Um you broke up a little bit, but I think I heard that you.
19:36:17 Each math and science.
19:36:20 Yeah, yeah, that's why I have my camera off is just like my Wi Fi that goes off every now.
19:36:25 Okay, yeah, if you want to take, turn your camera off like no pressure, you put on. Um, I can turn my camera off too because I know that can help the connection as well.
19:36:35 So let me know. Okay, thank you.
19:36:41 Um, but since this is our first session. Also, hold on, before I even get to that I'm so sorry, this about this morning. I'm not that this excuses what happened, but we don't have your names.
19:36:55 We have just like ID numbers. And so I got used, and again, not that that excuses it but, yeah, we don't we do for your confidentiality we don't put your name next to the number.
19:37:11 And I just texted the wrong person I'm so sorry.
19:37:17 I was like wait was like Did I miss something.
19:37:20 And I'm like, super busy to like I go to school full time and I work full time so I was like trying to jog my memory only week. Did it
19:37:30 know if he hadn't set any health goals yeah yeah like what did I commit to.
19:37:36 No, no, we definitely don't ask you know workout for 30 minutes that the participant was meant for decided that they wanted to work out for 30 minutes or go to the gym or something like that so it gives you a little bit of insight about like how I check
19:37:51 So, um, it gives you a little bit of insight about like how I check in with you, between our health coaching sessions, though, so.
19:37:58 Yeah, but thank you. And also I'm really happy to hear that you're taking time to go for a walk.
19:38:07 Okay. Um, so just transitioning a little bit I do have a just a brief introduction, and then following the introduction, we can go into setting those health goals for for you.
19:38:19 That's okay.
19:38:20 Okay.
19:38:23 Um, so, examine is a two part intervention program.
19:38:29 And one aspect of it is the health and wellness daily text messages, so you should have started receiving those by now.
19:38:39 They have Okay cool. And then the second part of the program is the health coaching, so I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks and then we're going to meet through zoom for about 20 to 30 minutes.
19:38:53 If you want to meet for longer than that. We totally Can you just give me, just let me know if that's kind of the support that you'd like.
19:39:02 And then during that time. During this time, I'll check in with you about the messages, your goal and also your stress level. And then, like I mentioned earlier, I'll check in with you in between our sessions through text message.
19:39:18 Okay, cool. And if any questions come up that are outside of my scope, I'll let you know, and refer you to the appropriate resource.
19:39:29 So the example, sorry about that. The example that I give for that is, um, you know some people may have a lot on their mind and would want to get connected to therapy, but I'm not a therapist, but I can help you refer you to caps or something like that.
19:39:51 And then the last little bit is the fact that this is a research study, and we will be collecting data, but our conversations will be kept confidential and your and de identified So like I mentioned, like we don't use your name we use like an ID, and
19:40:10 then.
19:40:11 Yeah, but I know your name, and I should know your ID but that's okay. Okay, cool. And then so by the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting as a way to feel empowered about your spiritual mental and
19:40:28 physical health.
19:40:30 And then the last thing I'll say is thank you for choosing to participate. Your participation is going to help us determine if like more USF students will benefit from this program as well as if we can offer it to them in a large scale.
19:40:52 Cool. Okay, any questions.
19:40:52 No, no questions.
19:40:54 Okay.
19:40:55 Um, so, like I mentioned, I'll be checking in with you about the text messages.
19:41:01 So I'll start there, what, what are your thoughts about the tech tech. Sorry, text messages so far.
19:41:11 I think, kind of like okay whatever I could ignore you know, but then like when I had time, I was like oh like this is interesting, okay cool I should go out on the walk, I should go you like fruits and vegetables, you know.
19:41:24 And so, like, one day I had a banana and I was like, I could do this like I couldn't eat a banana or like, it's all like the next day at like today I had to.
19:41:36 I think number four that was talking about like exercising being healthy and it's like okay, this is just telling me everything already knows something that doctor tells you, but like it's a nice reminder and then I was like, I have some time.
19:41:56 Let me go through my messages. Oh, they told me I should go on a walk, I guess I'm gonna go on a walk. And so when I talk. And then I invited my friend on the walk and then I took my dog on a walk, so it was like nice to like get out and maybe like maybe
19:41:59 that's why I've been having like two or three good days in a row which is like nice, it's a nice change, you know, it's like I actually vented about things on my walk with my friend, I like let off some steam when I went on a walk with my dog.
19:42:13 I wasn't cranky because I wasn't eating you know and if I was cranky it's like okay so I had food now I should go to sleep earlier, you know.
19:42:24 Wow. Who knew a text message could do all that, like, Okay, wait I want to see what they're texting me What if I reply Let me see my reply will fly a robot kind of thing, you know, and that was like, okay, cool like somebody cares somebody wants me to
19:42:46 okay so I'm going to go for. Yeah, no, definitely, so I do get those text messages do come to me, hence the confusion.
19:42:53 So, if there's ever a question you have, or if you just want to respond to one of like the daily text messages. I'll get the response.
19:43:04 Okay.
19:43:06 And then I was gonna say.
19:43:10 So some people like text me photos like if they decide to like maybe do healthy eating or go for a walk and then they'll text me a photo of like what they did on their walk so you're welcome to do stuff like that too.
19:43:26 Um, and the messages that do come at 930, every day.
19:43:32 The Pro, we actually created those messages.
19:43:38 Sorry.
19:43:41 We created.
19:43:44 Yeah. And we just have them scheduled to go out at a certain time. So, someone didn't make them.
19:43:51 It wasn't a robot. But we have a robot sending them.
19:43:56 Yeah. Cool.
19:44:00 And then.
19:44:03 So it sounds like the text messages also helped motivate you, and a lot of ways.
19:44:10 Where were you like in joining program was there like a specific goal that you had in mind that you wanted to like work towards.
19:44:21 or examine or for what sorry. Yeah, so like over the next four weeks.
19:44:27 I didn't have a goal I think it was more of like, Oh, you guys need somebody to do research with, you know, and I feel like it's always hard getting participants.
19:44:38 And if I get if I fit the criteria that I'm going to want you guys to do well and they want to like support your research, you know, especially like other business.
19:44:47 And I was like, oh, like that the criteria if I have time like I'll do it, I'll try and like support them. It wasn't necessarily for like my, to be honest.
19:44:56 Okay, appreciate the help and I think we can be creative, around like what you'd like to set around your health goals.
19:45:12 For example, like you mentioned going on walks.
19:45:15 Maybe you want to make walking a routine for healthy, like eating more vegetables.
19:45:22 So, we can set goals around those things. And then, If you.
19:45:29 And then you'll just achieve them really easily, or we can set bigger goals, maybe you're interested in like working out like for 30 minutes.
19:45:38 Like my other.
19:45:44 But, um, any do any of those like prompt inspiration.
19:45:51 I think definitely eating healthier. I mean, I play soccer, I go on walks with my friend whenever we have time. We just haven't set time recently, so definitely like your party.
19:46:06 Huh. Okay, cool. So, um, we can definitely set a health goal around that.
19:46:12 Before we do that, I'd like to ask about your stress.
19:46:16 What's your stress level been like for the week.
19:46:29 I think this week has been better to be honest I feel like I'm usually like 11 or 12 so I work full time I'm a teacher. Yeah, and I also in school full time like in this grad program.
19:46:45 And on top of that, um, I know that USF is like a semester system. I'm also in the quarter system for school. So I like was taking nine classes. This past like this actual semester with the quarter system.
19:47:01 And then like working full time and so it was just like super busy and yeah but I feel like right now I think because like two of my classes are over I'm like more like a seven or six I feel like things are more doable.
19:47:15 And I think that like going on walks and like eating healthier has definitely been helping me like be more productive and want to get my work done.
19:47:24 Whoa, just props to all around.
19:47:41 I can barely keep up with my classes, and my full time job like props to.
19:47:36 So, what, what's the other program that you're in.
19:47:42 Um, yeah I don't like you know i don't know if you are you from the Bay Area.
19:47:47 Um, I live in Santa Cruz, but technically is not the Bay Area but I know a lot of places in the Bay Area.
19:47:55 Okay. Um, there's a hill Community College.
19:48:00 And so, I grew up always want to be a veterinarian, and they told like everybody, I want to be a veterinarian, and now that I'm a teacher I tell everybody like you can follow your dreams work hard for whatever you want.
19:48:14 And it's like I didn't work hard to be a veterinarian like I'm telling my kids, my students to like do whatever they want, and like, follow their dreams if they try hard but I'm not doing it, you know.
19:48:27 And so, I enrolled in like a few classes for Hill Community College, to get those prerequisites done. So teaching, I do a full time and I'm in grad school for but it's kinda like my plan B.
19:48:48 I'm getting good, just in case I don't do with a hard or hard classes like chemistry sucks, I think. And so, I just want to do well there and like prove like see like, if you guys could do like I should be able to do it to you now.
19:48:59 And so I took like a chemistry class, like another intro to like memory medicine class.
19:49:07 So, a lot of things to handle on your play and also like be an inspiration to your children.
19:49:17 Yeah, it's all like, bye, bye, bye my kids I mean like my students I have 25 kids so that I have students, but I always call them like my kids so like my kids so my kids that but they're my students at school I don't have any.
19:49:29 Yeah, what grade do teach.
19:49:33 I teach fourth grade math and they teach third to fifth grade science.
19:49:37 Well, yeah, lots of kiddos.
19:49:40 Yeah.
19:49:42 And also fun in science, or science and math or fun.
19:49:47 Yeah, I, those are my favorites so I feel like if I'm able to like make it fun for you and have you learn I like it's a win win situation.
19:50:00 Yeah.
19:49:58 Well, considering like that you do have a lot of stress in your life, kind of base level, like even, even if a, if a seven is like on a day like that's still a significant amount of stress.
19:50:15 If when this kind of comes up, we can also set set set. I'm so sorry I don't know if it's just like late in the day but I'm like Stumbling on my work.
19:50:23 But we can also set goals around stress management.
19:50:29 So like meditation.
19:50:34 Taking a bath self care whatever, you know, that means to you, but we'll go ahead and move forward with the eating healthy goal
19:50:46 and see if you want to do two goals we can add more if you want.
19:50:51 But the format for the health goal is the SMART goal format. Are you familiar with the SMART goal.
19:51:00 No.
19:51:01 Okay, so smart stands for. Specific, Measurable, Attainable relevant and timely.
19:51:11 So we just try to ensure like your health goal has all of those that their specific, measurable, attainable relevant and timely.
19:51:21 Um.
19:51:35 Generally, the time is one week since we meet every week, and you're welcome to keep the same goal every week if you want to. But, for example, in a week or in, and the next week, I will go bike riding for 20 minutes, three times out of the whole week.
19:51:43 So we have that be specific, we made it measurable because it's for 20 minutes, three times that week. It's attainable because I have a bike, and I have 20 minutes in my life.
19:51:56 And then it's relevant because I want to increase my physical activity and I like bike riding.
19:52:04 So that's just one example of how we can set a SMART goal. So, with healthy eating it's really broad right now. Is there an area that you want to focus on.
19:52:19 I think definitely like not eating out and like eating more like fruits and vegetables like I mentioned, like I just grabbed, or maybe I didn't tell you what I got, I grabbed a banana.
19:52:39 Henry to 12th grade, I was used to like eating once a day. Because it's like I just would get up at like 715 when school started at eight get there right on time. Now you through the day after like school I will go to work, I had a job and ninth to 12th
19:53:01 and then I like soccer practice and stuff. I get home have my lunch and do my homework like that's what I was used to. And then I went to college, and I started eating like three times a day.
19:53:06 And like now I am trying to cut back down, I eat.
19:53:11 Sometimes I eat three times a day there's like no set time.
19:53:14 But I feel like when I do eat once or twice. It's always like eating out.
19:53:20 Not really eating at home, or like getting healthy snack is always like, I'm, like, going to a good dancer for like tacos, or going to like jack in the box or something.
19:53:34 I love that place.
19:53:41 I go to the one year Redwood City which is like a 10 minute drive and all like text my friend I'm like hey let's go. The one on middle field.
19:53:48 Yes. Oh my goodness. That's the only one I go to, they have the best food. yes. Okay, so, so relatable. But I hear you on wanting to reduce your intake of fast food.
19:54:07 So, and also you want to increase.
19:54:10 Like your fruits and vegetables or just like maybe more home cooked food, we can, You can tell me a little more about that.
19:54:24 about.
19:54:29 I'm sorry, I think mostly even like fruits and vegetables. Okay, because I don't need enough.
19:54:33 Okay.
19:54:36 So, put food fruits.
19:54:41 So, I'm in terms of limiting your consumption of fast food, there's a couple of ways to do this one you can say like, I'm going to eat. I'm not going to eat fast food for like the whole week, or you can say like I'm only going to eat fast food.
19:55:02 Three times the whole week.
19:55:05 Do any of those vibe with like where you want to go with this goal.
19:55:11 I think the second option of like only eating a like a certain amount of time. Okay.
19:55:19 Well, look, it's more doable and we eat all this and that's be, that'd be good.
19:55:27 Um, what we froze.
19:55:49 I don't know that's a good question.
19:55:53 Let's check your debit cards, three times, four times.
19:55:58 Honestly, yeah.
19:55:59 Okay, so what seems like a doable goal, like a to reduce the amount of fast food.
19:56:11 I think like once or twice would be best because it saves me money.
19:56:21 Mm hmm.
19:56:21 Okay, so you will, and the next week you will limit your consumption of fat fast food to two times the whole week.
19:56:33 That's an accurate.
19:56:42 Okay, then.
19:56:44 So the way that you going to meet here I just turned off my video.
19:56:49 Okay, I'll turn off mine too so that hopefully it helps the connection.
19:56:56 So, the piece that we're missing is how to make it relevant and you already mentioned, like, they help save you money. Why else is this goal important to you.
19:57:14 I think it's also like healthy body healthy mind, you know, so you won't feel tired and cranky all day.
19:57:22 So like, it'll help lift your mood.
19:57:28 Yes.
19:57:29 Cool.
19:57:31 Um, so one way to make sure that this is an achievable goal is to ask about your confidence level. On a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
19:57:47 Like an eight.
19:57:49 Okay, Cool.
19:57:53 Um, and then transitioning to the second goal that you were thinking of setting in regards to increasing your fruits and vegetables.
19:58:02 Are you familiar with serving sizes.
19:58:06 Yeah.
19:58:07 Okay, So, I'm kind of what your baseline.
19:58:13 I'm serving size of fruits and vegetable send a day.
19:58:18 Oh God, nothing. I don't need any fruits or vegetables at all.
19:58:22 Okay.
19:58:23 No worries for what what's, what's the goal in mind, do you want to like have a be one serving of fruit or a vegetable.
19:58:35 You can, like, what seems good to you.
19:58:38 Yeah, I think between like 123 servings would be great, hopefully like more on like the two or three and instead of just one.
19:58:46 Okay, so wanted to serving.
19:58:52 And then we do want to specifically focus on fruits, or do you want to specifically focus on vegetables or both.
19:59:02 I think for each other. Okay.
19:59:06 Um, what kind of fruits. Do you like
19:59:15 um like bananas strawberries I think all the fruits, I'm not picky when it comes to fruit.
19:59:22 Okay. And then, um, do you have access to fruits and vegetables or fruits like are they, is it something you have or that you need to go by
19:59:36 both I could go on and buy them and I have access to them at all.
19:59:40 Okay, cool.
19:59:41 And then, do you want to increase your.
19:59:54 I think I'm going to aim for every day.
19:59:58 But, like, I think realistically will have to be like every other day.
20:00:05 Okay, so I'll, I'll say, for four of the seven days.
20:00:15 Okay, cool. Um, do.
20:00:20 Would it be helpful to like put reminders on your calendar or set alarms on your phone to help you meet this goal.
20:00:30 Yeah, I usually set reminders for things.
20:00:33 Okay, cool.
20:00:44 And then I'll text you throughout the week just to check in on how you're doing. Um, regarding this goal. Um, I'm sure it's very similar to your first response but why is it, why is this important to you.
20:00:58 I think, yeah, just to be healthier.
20:01:02 In, with my body and my mind.
20:01:04 Okay, cool. Like, at least like, I let him setting goals like that's why but yeah at the beginning it was more of like new participants here.
20:01:14 Cool.
20:01:18 Thank you. Thank you.
20:01:22 And then, um, what's your confidence level and meeting your SMART goal.
20:01:30 Um, I don't know,
20:01:33 probably like a seven maybe.
20:01:37 Okay.
20:01:43 That's pretty good. And there's also like a little bit of, um, maybe you're anticipating some challenges or barriers to meeting this goal.
20:01:49 And you repeat that I'm sorry.
20:01:51 Um, so, you know, there's a there's a little bit of sense that you're sensing some barriers to meeting your goal.
20:02:03 Yeah, I think, like for example if I don't have fruits or vegetables at home, and it's like about getting access to it it's just like because I'm so busy.
20:02:17 When do you normally go grocery shopping or.
20:02:23 Do you like do you leave your home, I know, like, that sounds like a really strange question but with everybody being remote.
20:02:33 I try to go on Sundays.
20:02:35 Okay, Cool.
20:02:37 So not not too far away.
20:02:43 Okay.
20:02:45 So, um, I think you've said two really good health goals, I'm just going to repeat them for you and I'm also going to send these to you in an email, but your first goal is in the next week you will consume us or you will limit your consumption of fast
20:02:58 food to two times the whole week. And then your second goal is in the next week, you will eat one to two servings of fruits for four of the seven days.
20:03:09 And then for that one specifically, you're going to set reminders and then on Sunday when you go shopping you're just gonna load up.
20:03:19 Does that sound right.
20:03:22 Yes.
20:03:22 Okay, cool.
20:03:29 and then.
20:03:27 So that concludes like the health coaching session. And we just need to schedule another time to meet next week.
20:03:53 Let's see. So we're meeting today at 730. Does this time work next week as well.
20:03:54 Can we do like maybe 815.
20:03:58 Whatever you possible not I'm more free on Mondays.
20:04:02 Okay.
20:04:04 We can do a 15 on Thursday that should be fun.
20:04:08 Are you okay with that though because I know it's like pretty late for you to.
20:04:12 I'm fine. I think today is just a long day so I apologize for not being on it.
20:04:22 So yeah, no worries.
20:04:23 Okay, cool. So I'll send you the Google invite and a little bit for that meeting, and then do you want to meet at 815, every Thursday for the next three Thursdays or do you want to take it week by week.
20:04:37 I don't have my meeting every Thursday, or however you prefer.
20:04:43 Okay, I'll send you the invite for a 15 them on Thursdays them.
20:04:48 Okay.
20:04:51 Okay, Cool.
20:05:02 Hey, thank you. Yeah. Take care.
20:05:05 You too. Thanks, they say
20:05:10 hi.
