09:09:35 Hi. Sorry I should have started cleaning can't hear you.
09:09:43 I hear you now.
09:09:44 Okay, I said sorry I had to go move my car because of straight claiming really quick. Oh no, no worries Mike maybe something came up.
09:09:53 I figure something that come up, like, Oh wait, wait, see what about that. No thank you, thank you so much for being able to make it and we have time, and I, my, my schedule is flexible this morning.
09:10:08 So we can still do the allotted time so no worries.
09:10:14 So I'll start just by giving you a little introduction about the program itself, and sort of what, then what we're going to be working on today. How does that sound good.
09:10:25 Well my name is Eddie Gallagher.
09:10:30 And I'm going to be your health coach for the next four weeks.
09:10:34 And as you've noticed that someone is sort of a two part intervention. So one aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving.
09:10:45 And the other part is to meet with, with the health coach so that will be me and my role will be to check in with you for at least 20 minutes.
09:10:56 If we need a little bit more time that's that's totally fine and we can, we can schedule that in.
09:11:02 During that time, the goal is really to check in with each other. I'll be asking you about the messages to get your input on what is making a difference, are some of the messages motivating you to do things, or they're just kind of nice and you know you'd
09:11:20 like to get them every morning but nothing's really happening.
09:11:23 The other part is to set goals. So part of our program is goal setting. So we want to work with you to get your thoughts on what are some of the goals you want to work on.
09:11:41 And together we'll formulate them so that they are achievable and be able to do them within a week time frame. So I'll follow up with you between sessions to.
09:11:47 Usually I do that via text or email.
09:11:51 That way I can check in and see how you're doing with with your goal.
09:11:54 If at any time there's questions or topics that might be outside of my scope of expertise as a health coach, I will do my best to refer you or connect you to appropriate resources, because we want to make sure that you get the services that that you really
09:12:12 need.
09:12:14 So while this is considered research we and we are collecting data, just know that specific conversations will be kept confidential data will be de identified.
09:12:26 So you're welcome to share as much as you like, or as little as you like whatever makes you feel comfortable.
09:12:35 By the end of the four weeks, we hope that you gain skills around problem solving. Goal study which will be doing today, and that you feel empowered to be able to manage your spiritual mental and physical health.
09:12:49 So I really want to thank you for choosing to participate because your participation is really going to influence what happens next with this program, can we actually implemented at a larger scale.
09:13:02 So do you have questions before we get started.
09:13:10 Um, I don't think so like not off the top of my head.
09:13:12 Okay, well I've asked talked quite a bit because that's a bit of a long spiel.
09:13:18 But I guess before I start about asking you about messages or anything I do want to know a little bit more about you and sort of what brings you here today What are you hoping to to get out of the sessions and what are some of the things that you want
09:13:33 to focus on today.
09:13:37 Yeah.
09:13:40 So, well I'm a senior to nursing major. First off,
09:13:47 and I would say, I was most drawn to this program just because it's been a really hectic year for me, personally, and just like the last couple months like academically as well.
09:14:03 It's been really challenging to like balance health and wellness with like my studies and exams and we have like this big exit hussy it's called exam that is like.
09:14:17 It's on Saturday, and actually give a second time, which is really also stressful and it kind of got me down that I didn't pass it the first time.
09:14:30 And so my goal is kind of just to improve my mental health, as well as my physical health and I have been taking steps to improve my physical health.
09:14:47 Just because with everything that was going on like in my personal life and so busy with school like I didn't feel like I had any time to like eat healthy or exercise and those are things that I always prioritize in the past, especially with like coven
09:15:03 and like the gyms are closed like I was always like a gym rat kind of like, I would go like six days a week and like then it was like no jams and so I'd like figure out other things to do that I don't like as much and like, I'm really big on my physical
09:15:18 health and well being, but definitely it wasn't a priority the past several months.
09:15:23 And I did have like weight gain and stuff that really also kind of got me down and like made me feel just like not good about the way I looked physically.
09:15:36 And then also just like not eating well and not exercising like exercise is also like a stress reliever for me. So like just feeling like I didn't have time to do that and then having even more stress was like 10 times as stressful.
09:15:52 And so, like, I saw this opportunity and I'm like, you know, maybe this is presenting itself to me like for reason like I've had a really bad year it's been a rough couple of months, like, I'm going to take advantage of this opportunity.
09:16:13 Really,
09:16:14 Unless that you found it, or you saw this as a bit of a sign okay maybe it's something I can give it a try, is as you mentioned this, there's a lot of things that have been stacking on top of each other from, from what I hear, and it gets to a point where
09:16:31 you're realizing that there's something that you need to do about it.
09:16:36 So it's, it's a very good step forward and managing your health, and also knowing. Okay, I need not, I wouldn't say help, but I would say assistance I need some kind of guidance to move me forward.
09:16:53 And can you kind of add to that that rent or a bit. Yeah.
09:16:58 So, you mentioned that you are a nursing student student, and there's a lot of things that have happened or change during the pandemic.
09:17:07 The way that you've managed dress before it sort of has had to shift a bit.
09:17:12 So every week I will be asking about your stress level.
09:17:17 So on a scale of one to 10, what would you say was your stress level for this week.
09:17:24 Whoo. Hello.
09:17:29 YSR 10 very stressed, like a nine.
09:17:34 And you mentioned that you have an exam coming up to me that sort of adding to this level of stress then yeah the probably the biggie right now is just the anxiety around, am I gonna pass.
09:17:52 Have I done enough.
09:17:55 And what have you been able to do to help you manage that stress, are you working on something right now.
09:18:04 Or just kind of going, as you go.
09:18:10 And the first. So the exam is kind of.
09:18:13 It was like the first five weeks of the semester, you had like your first try and then it was like, this is kind of the next five weeks and this is like the second try and so like the first five or six weeks I also had like clinical, which was like 24,
09:18:29 hours a week, sort of like in the hospital like basically a part time job on top of like another part time job I already had on top of like full time students on top of studying for this thing so then I was not eating well at all.
09:18:43 I was not exercising, I slept like four or five hours a night like I was doing absolutely nothing for myself whatsoever.
09:18:54 Now that my clinical that finished.
09:18:57 I've had a little bit more time open up and I've had more time to study and kind of prepare myself for the second exam.
09:19:05 And so I have taken time in the day to like every day to like go for a walk or like go for a run or do yoga. So what I've been doing currently to kind of manage that stress would be like, I've made it a point to get out and do some kind of exercise every
09:19:20 day, and also try to like make a healthy meal and so just like buying like chicken and fries, because it was quick and easy actually like made, you know, a rap like stuff like that.
09:19:36 So I've been able to manage it a little better and I do feel more like okay I did so many hours of study, studying I had like a little break I did some more hours studying like I feel just more structured, because I like a lot of structure.
09:19:56 So then I would say my stress was like 10 to 1011 out of 10.
09:20:01 Now it's kind of gone down, and I do feel a little more prepared. Okay, good.
09:20:09 I mean, so it sounds like you are already doing some goal setting and you've already been making some changes.
09:20:17 Because you mentioned that you have a little bit more time now and and thinking right now just as it stands today.
09:20:24 How are you doing on meeting your goals on a scale of one to 10.
09:20:34 Be like a.
09:20:39 Okay.
09:20:40 Okay.
09:20:43 So I ask is, we have different skills and our goal is throughout the program to ask that on a regular basis to see if that changes. We hope.
09:20:54 Yeah.
09:20:55 So you, you mentioned quite a few things that you're already working on.
09:20:59 And I think our goal would be to ensure that you maintain them or that you continue to do the things that keep you going and keep you motivated.
09:21:08 So another aspect of the program is goal setting as I mentioned, ever we're going to be using a very specific form of goal setting and you might have heard of this before.
09:21:18 We use the acronym smart.
09:21:21 So we want to make our goals specific, we want to make the measurable, attainable, relevant, and there's going to be a time frame.
09:21:30 So for example, today is Thursday, and Michael would be that if we could meet every Thursday morning. However, I know that your schedule my change. So we'll we'll keep it flexible.
09:21:43 But let's say we are able to meet every Thursday, then today we set a goal. And then following week, we'll check in about that gold, along with all the other questions that I've asked before.
09:21:57 And, and sort of figure out how is it going, is it working out. Are you able to achieve that goal, and also make a new goal for the following week, how does that sound.
09:22:11 Yeah, yeah. okay.
09:22:11 So in thinking about this week and maybe some of the things that you're already doing, is there something that you want to continue to do or focus a little bit more on.
09:22:21 I know you mentioned that you go for walks, you also try to make food at home.
09:22:29 Is there something else that you had in mind because I know you mentioned that you want to focus on your mental health.
09:22:35 Is there something else that you were thinking maybe meditation or.
09:22:41 What are your thoughts.
09:22:49 Well, I do want to improve kind of my mental health.
09:22:53 I think I just don't really know how.
09:22:58 So I'm open to suggestions.
09:23:03 And the initial questionnaire, I took for this is like a lot of questions about religion, which is kind of like a sticky subject for me right now because I was always very religious like I went to Catholic school forever and ever like my family goes to
09:23:22 mass like every Sunday and when I'm home and San Diego like.
09:23:26 Of course I like go to Mass with them and everything, and pray before meals and all that but on my own I don't really do any of that anymore. And I also don't really have motivation to do it.
09:23:38 And I kind of don't care to do it.
09:23:43 I, it's more of like a formality and like I do it to like be a good like obedient daughter I'm like, not make my parents tab.
09:23:52 So they're like, Did you go to Mass today like you know like no.
09:23:59 So cool. It's kind of sad that I don't feel close to, like religion or God anymore and maybe that's like also played a part in my mental health in some way.
09:24:17 But like all, there's just been so much that have happened in my life and so much like loss and like death that I just kind of lost the desire to care about religion is night.
09:24:34 So, yeah, I don't know if that's there's definitely a times. I feel that that's part of being a really just human being, to be honest, that there's usually this pull between what we believe in what we see and the things that happen around us that affect
09:24:53 our believes, and I would say just be gentle with yourself, because our beliefs and our spirituality changes over time. So this is a process that you're going through, and it doesn't mean that you've lost all faith.
09:25:11 It just means that your faith is changing.
09:25:15 And I say this because especially in the Jesuit tradition. I think they're very open to this idea that if we don't question our religion. Then, what are we doing like we need to we need to and that's actually the essence of examined to, and that's where
09:25:32 took the name from, because we want students to, to learn new things question, what they know and grow. And it's part of a growing process. And I would say, spirituality or religion can happen in many different ways.
09:25:51 So don't feel that you have to go to church every single day or every Sunday to please people.
09:25:58 It has to be something that centers you and pleases you.
09:26:03 So I would say even meditation can be part of spirituality, even going for a walk, can be part of spirituality.
09:26:21 It's really about being present and enjoying that moment that you're in. Is that something that you want to work on, or what are you thinking.
09:26:26 Yeah, I think it can be one of the goals.
09:26:31 So let's work on to making it specific and measurable and attainable. So are you thinking, I'm trying to think
09:26:44 there's mindfulness meditation so that could be start.
09:26:50 What else.
09:26:52 You mentioned you go for a walk so I'm just trying to think if there's a way we can incorporate the walk so you can continue to do the things that you enjoy.
09:27:04 You know I see everything as a potential to help your mental health, even when you talk about making your own meals and cooking, just fully experiencing the moment of cooking.
09:27:15 I think it also be a good way to do it.
09:27:21 So what are you leaning towards, or if you have other ideas, we can bring some. Okay.
09:27:28 Yeah, and I like those, um, maybe let's for this week, focus on like, like when I do like Walker exercise like, just to be really present in that moment and not so much thinking about like school or like old conversations are like arguments I've had with
09:27:56 people and instead just kind of like enjoying nature and being present in that moment.
09:28:03 Do you tend to listen to music when you're walking or you just walk and pay attention to what's around you.
09:28:11 I do tend to listen to music, you can, because there's also. Have you ever heard of walking meditation.
09:28:21 I haven't really, because I believe there could be audios that could talk. So it's sort of like listening to something, but it's more reminding you about to focus on your breath to pay attention to your surroundings.
09:28:38 So that kind of brings that awareness back to, to where you are. So I can find a few of those and send them to see if you, if you would find them useful.
09:28:50 Yeah, okay.
09:28:57 So we'll do.
09:28:56 But we're gonna call this mindful.
09:28:59 Okay, sounds good. And how, how long do you, do you want to walk for in terms of time. Um, I'll probably go, I can only go forward to follow it hour, because I live pretty close to the beats and the park so it's easy to get, like, oh, going and kind of
09:29:18 get lost. Those are great locations to, because you'll see nature, you'll see water, it can be very clear to one hour, and how many days this upcoming week.
09:29:32 And thinking about your schedule and just something that is absolutely achievable. It doesn't have to be all week long, it can be one day, two days, three days, whatever you decide, 14, probably, let's see.
09:29:50 Two to three.
09:29:55 And will you do this in the morning and the afternoon.
09:30:07 early afternoon like between like 123, kind of like the peak, some like hours early afternoon.
09:30:19 And why would you say that this is important to you.
09:30:27 to help with my physical and mental health.
09:30:32 I really do think that this is a two in one very good to be helping your physical health but also your their mental won't be.
09:30:42 So we'll measure the progress. What are some ways that we can measure progress for this.
09:30:51 Like with the check in next week. Okay, so with our check in, do you use like a pedometer or do you carry your phone with you to track steps or anything like that.
09:31:08 Yeah, yeah I carry my phone so it tracks, my steps. Yes.
09:31:31 Something that you can, something that you can see, like right away, but also Yes, will be checking in about it. Next,
09:31:22 and and thinking about your confidence about doing this, how would you, how would you rate your confidence on a scale of one to 10, one being not very confident and 10 completely confident that you'll do this,
09:31:40 that it's like achievable.
09:31:45 Um, I would say, like a nine.
09:31:48 Like I'll definitely do it one or two days, I just might not do it the third day, when it comes up. So like hundred percent for doing at least twice.
09:31:57 Okay.
09:32:00 We'll keep it at two to three, but we'll know that it's flexible.
09:32:04 Okay,
09:32:10 think those are all my questions for you.
09:32:15 Anything else that you want to work on. Is there another goal that you would want to set or do you want to start with one and see how that goes.
09:32:27 Maybe let's
09:32:31 just start with the one that's sweet.
09:32:35 I agree, I'm all about starting small baby steps, because I find it can be overwhelming to try to do too many things at once. But yeah, I definitely don't want to overwhelm myself, especially with like the exam on Saturday.
09:32:49 If we said a second ago, I would be like, zero I don't think I would do it.
09:32:54 And, and the idea is that, that we set you up to succeed. I definitely don't want to set you up for failure, and you have quite a bit coming up. we have your exam, is it this Saturday.
09:33:09 It is.
09:33:10 So you have your exam this Saturday so you want to be able to to spend time on that too. So this should never be something that's stressful. And if you find that we ever make a goal.
09:33:22 And it's stressing you out.
09:33:25 One of the things I always remember is, well, I set this goal. So I can change it and do something that I can do right now.
09:33:36 So never liked. Don't let it stress you out so if you find that it's, it's becoming a bit of a challenge, just do something else that you really want to do and we'll check in on that following.
09:33:56 I'm really gonna ask me about the text messaging.
09:34:05 It's on my sheet but it's at the very top and since we started with everything else.
09:34:09 Yes, I want to ask you about the messages. So, any messages that stood out to you this week, or have any of them motivated you to do something new.
09:34:22 Um, I really like.
09:34:30 Think about this thing was in your day that give you a sense of peace strength joy and connection mind yourself with them every day.
09:34:37 I like that one.
09:34:39 And I actually like today's to make time for physical activity 30 minutes every day.
09:34:46 And then the second part, but I have a bad accent so I'm not going to read it.
09:34:56 Okay.
09:34:56 Yeah, we try to make them.
09:35:01 Some of them are just text and some of them will be more fun images.
09:35:07 But we, we try to add a little bit of like Spanish and a few of them, but it's totally fine.
09:35:13 Now I do like it I just, I don't actually speak it I can speak some stuff, but I'm definitely self conscious of my accent because I'm just English is my first and primary.
09:35:32 Yeah.
09:35:30 Yeah. But you're able to beat it and you're able to understand it.
09:35:34 Yeah.
09:35:37 So yeah, I've understood it so far. I hope the essence of it comes through.
09:35:42 Yes, yes.
09:35:45 Okay, good.
09:35:46 Well, make them to those have any of them motivated you to do something. I know you mentioned you like the exercise one that you know get you thinking, Okay, I need to get out there, but I feel you're already walking, there will be others around other
09:36:05 topics that maybe will trigger that I did like the work towards seven servings of fruits and veggies every day that one kind of made me think because I do a lot of fruit and veggies, but I'm like dude, Simon can only really like Camille today so I'm like,
09:36:24 like, maybe I should probably go another second, they have like a fruit or vegetable, because that one did get me thinking.
09:36:33 Gosh, and when we think about servings, and it varies for the type of food that you eat so for example, half a cup of an apple it's a serving. So let's say you have a whole apple or an apple is more than half a cup and you're actually having two servings.
09:36:55 Right.
09:36:55 And so it kind of varies on on the type of item that you're, you're having such as being aware of that it's good because you might be.
09:37:04 It depends on how many, you're happy.
09:37:10 But it's good to also add variety. So if you find that you're having more of one type of food than another sort of just reset that and it should be.
09:37:23 Are you familiar with my plate.
09:37:26 I heard of it. Yes. Yeah, so my plate has like a little guideline of how much should be like vegetables, fruit, and I protein and grains. That way your, your meals are always balanced and you get all the nutrients and vitamins that your body will need.
09:37:45 I can add a little resource on that. So after, after a meeting, what I'm going to do is I'll send you a summary of the goal that you've said, and add a few resources so I'll, I'll find some walking meditation audios that I can send you.
09:38:01 He could play on your phone as, as you walk.
09:38:04 And I'll send you a little bit of information on my plate.
09:38:07 Okay, thank you.
09:38:10 And maybe see some fruits because I always like to share what's in season.
09:38:15 Yeah. Yeah, I definitely really like that because I don't know seasonal foods but I do like I do like when I see them because they typically taste better.
09:38:24 Yeah, and it helps so that you have those in mind for when you go grocery shopping or when you get groceries.
09:38:33 Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.
09:38:36 Thank you.
09:38:43 Well next Thursday morning work to meet again.
09:38:46 Yeah.
09:38:46 Yeah.
09:38:47 So same time, nine ish.
09:38:51 Okay. Is it the same zoom link or will I get a new one every.
09:38:56 It'll be the same one. I'll send you the calendar invite so that you have it on your calendar again. Okay, that issue goodness name, it should be the same one.
09:39:07 Wonderful.
09:39:09 Okay, well have a great rest of your day and take care and best of luck with your exam.
09:39:16 Thank you.
09:39:20 Thanks so much. Have a good one. You too.
