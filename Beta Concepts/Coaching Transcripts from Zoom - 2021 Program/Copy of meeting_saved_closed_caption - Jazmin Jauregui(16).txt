19:13:37 Hello.
19:15:17 Hello.
19:15:19 Hi.
19:15:22 Yes Hey I'm glad this works.
19:15:26 I like got in and then they take me out but I don't know.
19:15:31 I think maybe because I'm using zoom, or another thing they have same time, I don't know. Oh, are you double zooming right now.
19:15:41 Yes, I am. Oh my goodness I'm so sorry. Do you want to find another time to me. No, no, no, that's fine, that's fine. I'm not like we're during the class break so we're fine.
19:15:53 Okay.
19:15:55 Um, well thank you for meeting with me and like double zooming.
19:16:02 Um, but yeah, my name is Jasmine and I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks. Um, I have a bit of an introduction, and then once we get through, and transition into your health goals.
19:16:16 So, examine is a two part intervention, where one aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages, which you should have started receiving is that correct.
19:16:27 Yeah. Okay, cool. And then the second part of the intervention is the health coaching. So, in my role as your health coach, I'll meet with you once a week, sorry, My voice is like weird, one second.
19:16:42 Okay.
19:16:46 Um, but yeah, I'll meet with you once a week for about 20 to 30 minutes.
19:16:51 I usually am flexible with that time. So if we need to meet for longer than that, just let me know.
19:17:06 And then in between our sessions, I'll text you here in there just to see if there's anything I can do to support your progress.
19:17:16 If questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise as a health coach. I'll let you know about the limitations of my knowledge and help you get connected to the appropriate resource.
19:17:28 So this could be like a therapist or a writing coach, whatever, you know, whatever the case may be.
19:17:39 And while this is a research study and we will be collecting data, our specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be identified.
19:17:49 So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with.
19:17:54 By the end of the four weeks, we hope that you gain skills around, problem solving, and goal setting as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual and mental, as well as your physical health.
19:18:07 Sorry, that was all very scripted, one last little bit.
19:18:12 I want to just again thank you for choosing to participate in our program.
19:18:18 Your participation will help us determine whether more USF students can benefit from this program, and whether we can offer no nerves goal setting.
19:18:27 So that's a little bit of the what I
19:18:33 do you have any questions before we get started.
19:18:41 No, no questions yet. I think there's a lot of information but I'll probably have questions along the line though.
19:18:46 Yeah, definitely feel free to ask her.
19:19:02 At any point you can text me the number that we're sending the text messages from like the automated text messages, is the same way that you can text me.
19:19:00 So, if you ever like any of the messages, all notice like, oh, Dennis this light, this message.
19:19:09 So you can communicate with in that way.
19:19:19 Okay, so it's a three three number right.
19:19:16 Yeah.
19:19:18 Okay.
19:19:22 Um, so I guess one kind of like open ended question that can help us get started is, what was your main motivation to signing on to the project.
19:19:34 I'm honestly, I was really interested with I think I saw the advertisement, or I got something like it was like automated email to my us, Gmail and I really liked how it was like, specifically like serving like you know like the Latinos, like USF students,
19:19:58 and I feel like I, I mean what's covered and everything going on, I, my like health gold and you know everything has kind of went down the drain. I started off really good and then I started working from home and then that kind of just like I kind of
19:20:15 got into, like, you know like, not that I didn't have no motivation to do anything but I know I could And so that kind of was interesting to me to see like, you know, maybe with this I will, you know like just really be extra motivated to do it because
19:20:33 I know I can, I just don't have that.
19:20:40 There's a word for it that I'm looking for but I just what you stand for and then what you're serving really interested me because I feel like I feel very connected to it and I know that I could benefit from it.
19:20:55 Yes, I'm a few you I relate to you.
19:21:00 And let's see what we can do.
19:21:05 Okay. So it sounds like you have some like health goals in mind.
19:21:10 Can you share a little bit about yeah what those are.
19:21:18 Yeah. Um, so, I have never been one to like step on the scale or like really have this like goal for my way.
19:21:26 I think that I'm, you know, pretty healthy for my age.
19:21:31 However, I do feel. I was always active with my whole life.
19:21:35 College undergrad and, you know, high school I've been in sports and just really love the outdoors and running. and so I think.
19:21:46 Ever since I started this grad program, I kind of.
19:21:50 In the beginning I started, you know, using that as like my coping skill and my coping mechanism instead of, you know, other things and I think probably it's been like to not month.
19:22:03 Now that I kind of stopped going to like my current gym and like stop really like actually setting time and then structure for working out because my gym ended up closing.
19:22:16 So I had to relocate gym drums and I just found one, but it's not the same I used to go to like CrossFit.
19:22:26 So, it's kind of more like lean to like a structure and so this one that I got now is more of an open gym so I kind of have to motivate myself to do things and kind of set that structure, there's a little bit harder and and so I'm kind of having trouble
19:22:42 But I would like to end up, you know, going back to my, at least like three out of the five days of the week working out, whether that be before work or after work.
19:22:56 I think that I just really need to kind of get back on the schedule.
19:23:01 So that's kind of where I'm looking at right now, just trying to get back on the working out.
19:23:09 I'd like I'm kind of eating healthy, so I will start, but I'm like my, my second goal right now is kind of getting in the gym.
19:23:18 But, yeah.
19:23:23 So I think this is a really good goal to like start off with, and it's almost like just getting back into the routine of things.
19:23:37 I'll add that.
19:23:37 So if you're ever interested in practicing like stress management, meditation, yoga,
19:23:55 or like creating a sleeper team, those all all those examples include include your health. So, I'm just I just wanted to throw that out there so that you know it's not just limited to like healthy eating and exercise.
19:24:11 Okay, okay, yeah i mean i feel like
19:24:16 i i don't know if you give any resources for like, both just because I don't know that sounds interesting but I don't know like have any like yoga or you know how to go about that.
19:24:34 Yeah, so, um, I.
19:24:33 It depends on like, if you want to set a health goal around it, but I can send you like web resources, um, just to give you like an introduction to the those options but don't feel pressured to like do something here it looks like not by being with.
19:24:52 Okay.
19:24:54 But does it okay just to send you a couple resources and see if they are. Yeah, yeah, that Wi Fi good look at them and you know, kind of look through, see if there's any that interests me.
19:25:07 Okay. And then you also mentioned being in like a graduate program, can I ask what program you're in.
19:25:13 Yeah, I'm, I'm in the MSP program.
19:25:20 How's that going
19:25:23 you know it's it's going.
19:25:27 I actually this my first year. No, I took off. I took two years in between like my undergrad and my masters and, you know, I felt like it was much needed break but now I'm kind of, I think it's just because the summers coming and Kobe, and everything
19:25:46 and I'm just looking forward to not having being outdoors and going back to the somewhat normal that I think schools is kind of, I mean I work full time as well so it's kind of a lot to handle and juggle but it's the program.
19:26:03 Yeah.
19:26:06 Okay, well I know you're like precious for time because you're in class. I'd like to know more about like your work and like other things that you're into but I'll keep it kind of simple, and then like, because I know you're like limited, so bear with
19:26:21 me. Um, so, and in terms of the health goal format, we use like the SMART goal, which stands for specific, measurable, attainable relevant and timely.
19:26:34 So one example could be in the next week. I will go bike riding for 20 minutes, three days out of the week. So, those, that's just kind of one format that we're going to read this book.
19:26:51 Does that sound okay.
19:26:53 Yeah.
19:26:55 Okay.
19:26:58 Um, so you made a goal, around, going to the gym. three out of five days of the week.
19:27:07 Is that right.
19:27:12 Yeah.
19:27:13 Um, one way that we can make it more specific is by saying you're going to work out for 20 minutes or 30 minutes, what seems most appropriate to you.
19:27:26 Um, let's do 30 minutes for three times within the seven days not five days just in case. Okay, my week is hectic at work or anything, flexible.
19:27:41 Yeah.
19:27:45 And then when you get to the gym I know you mentioned, like when you were doing the CrossFit stuff it was kind of like a program like they already had a program or you just had a follow that, for, for this new gym, you're gonna have to set your 30 minute
19:28:03 routine. Is that something you feel comfortable with and you have like the resource yeah yeah definitely I think I,
19:28:14 I kind of follow like some bloggers and I have some sort of plan but I like kind of what got so I think that, so cheap bubble.
19:28:22 Okay, cool.
19:28:27 And then, what, what makes this goal important to you or relevant to you.
19:28:49 Um, Just knowing that
19:28:49 it's going to enhance my life.
19:28:58 Yeah. Um, I think to go a little further than that, like how has working out enhance your life, broadly.
19:29:07 Um, I just kind of just like fills me with energy.
19:29:14 But I'm have more energy I feel better.
19:29:16 Throughout the day I feel better about myself.
19:29:20 Yeah.
19:29:24 So, I've written in the next week you will work out for 30 minutes for three of the five, sorry three of the sorry I wrote this all awkwardly but three days of the week, out of the week I just missed a word.
19:29:43 And then
19:29:43 you have plans, like workout plans from online bloggers. And this is important to you as a way to enhance your life, fill you with energy and feel better about yourself, as well as like throughout the day.
19:29:59 Okay.
19:30:01 Did I capture that correctly.
19:30:03 Yes, you did. Okay. And then, one way to assess if this is an achievable goal is your confidence level, so on a scale of one to 10, where one is like low confidence and 10 is high confidence.
19:30:21 What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
19:30:26 Um, I would say five.
19:30:28 Okay, so, um, but by you saying a five. It's like indicated that you see some barriers, what would be those barriers.
19:30:41 I think the barriers would just be
19:30:45 me.
19:30:47 Like, because I, I go to sleep really late and I wake up really early. So usually I have like classes in the evening after work so I would have to figure out either by go work out early morning before work or really late at night.
19:31:06 So my game is that
19:31:11 I'm finding the time for that, but I think that's my only barrier. But besides that I do see myself going so I mean, I'm just saying that as a five because, I mean, I'm just starting back up, and I took like a couple months off so I don't want to, you
19:31:31 know, say like I'm an eight and then not go all three times or something like that but, yeah, Yeah.
19:31:39 So how would you feel if we reduce the number of days that you went as like a starting point so like instead of three days, two days.
19:31:51 Does that feel more obtainable.
19:31:53 Yeah, Yeah, we could do that.
19:31:56 And then I'll be like, I'll be like out of eight nine.
19:32:00 Okay.
19:32:02 Yeah.
19:32:06 Because I know I could like I could make myself do it because I don't like not completing stuff but I would be.
19:32:20 I don't want.
19:32:20 I don't want to increase your stress. And then the other thing that we can do is like we can say, at least two days. So like, it gives you that route.
19:32:31 More than two days but minimum. No, no, we'll keep it up to. Okay.
19:32:37 No, no, we'll keep it up to. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah, well.
19:32:40 So, were you wanting justice at one health goal for this week.
19:32:46 Yeah, let's just let's just focus on that, and then we'll go from there next week.
19:32:53 Okay, sounds good. Um, do you feel like you need any support or resources.
19:32:59 Um No I don't think so. Not for not not for that goal. Okay.
19:33:03 I'll check in with you, um, like I said just throughout the week just to see how you're doing with meeting your health goal and if I can offer any support I will, before we sign off I do have a few additional questions for you.
19:33:23 They're pretty quick. One is around your stress level. On a scale of one to 10, what was your stress like this week.
19:33:34 One to 10 I would say a five.
19:33:36 Okay. That's pretty good.
19:33:39 And then the next question was around the text messages.
19:33:45 Were there any messages that stood out to you, or that motivated you
19:33:58 know nothing that really,
19:34:04 no.
19:34:05 Okay.
19:34:10 So, with a text messages.
19:34:12 It's going to be something I do ask every week. So, just a heads up about that.
19:34:20 Yeah.
19:34:21 Any questions, we sign off.
19:34:26 No, no question so my point of contact with you would be through the 833 number Correct, yeah and you're also welcome to email me.
19:34:36 Yeah, I'll email you a summary of your health goals that you set today, and then. Okay.
19:34:48 And then you'll just have that for reference. Okay.
19:34:51 Sounds good.
19:34:51 Alrighty, well thank you again. And, Oh, actually, do you want to schedule a time to meet next week or do you want to schedule that through text.
19:35:04 I think next week at the same time.
19:35:06 That's fine.
19:35:08 I will have.
19:35:13 By any chance, can you do 615
19:35:18 one.
