17:01:18 Hi.
17:01:18 Hi. How are you, Good how are you.
17:01:22 Good, good. How's your day going.
17:01:26 It's good.
17:01:29 Warm. So,
17:01:33 summer weather's coming, and you believe it. It's so early I'm like, gosh thing he does coming.
17:01:44 Yeah, it's, it's pretty intense. Yeah.
17:01:49 Overall, it's good.
17:01:51 Yeah, that's nice.
17:01:54 I, I've been having a little bit of internet troubles so please let me know if something happens I can turn off my video and then we can have better connection.
17:02:08 Okay.
17:02:10 But where do you want to start today.
17:02:15 Um, why my my health goals.
17:02:20 Friday and Saturday and then I went yesterday. So I actually went three times.
17:02:26 Cool. So you exceeded your health goals. Yes. So that was good.
17:02:35 Overall it's been a good week.
17:02:38 I got all my work done. It was a productive week, huh.
17:02:43 Yeah, so I have nothing to complain about.
17:02:49 Okay, this is good. Yeah, that kind of leads into like the stress question like on a scale of one to 10, how is, how's your stress been like this week.
17:02:59 Oh, like a two.
17:03:03 Wow. Yeah, I've been ahead of everything which is nice.
17:03:07 And I had been like that accomplishment of going like Friday and Saturday for my health goals.
17:03:13 Sunday, Monday off and then yesterday I was like okay I'm going to go, even though it's not on my goal to go.
17:03:21 I had the time and I wanted to go.
17:03:24 Yeah.
17:03:28 exceeded goal.
17:03:29 Yep.
17:03:32 Do you want to talk a little bit about like how you felt afterwards like after going to the gym or like what have been like the positive outcomes of meeting your health goals are doing your health goal, I should say.
17:03:46 I mean, it does really feel good. I mean, when I go I'm always feel like really great out there I feel like if I go early in the day it gives me energy throughout the day where I won't need that like coffee pick me up.
17:04:01 And then when I go at the end of the day, it kind of just like feels good to just end the day on a good note, take a good like hot shower and then just go to sleep.
17:04:12 So, Both options are really good.
17:04:16 And then I feel that having these goals have just helped me prioritize my days and my workload, because I've been like in the back of my mind like okay I'm going to check in with you.
17:04:28 I don't want to be like yeah, so it like forces me to actually like be held accountable for accomplishing them which for me to like not lack on anything else.
17:04:47 Hmm.
17:04:48 Well, so so much can be done when like, just like a shift in perspective happens. Yeah.
17:04:55 So I feel like progress from like week one to now, but like week when I was just lost and I'm like I don't know what to do like I want to be that person that wastes about five in the morning but that's just not realistic.
17:05:08 but it feels good to at least get something done.
17:05:14 Yeah. So, I think something that really stands out to what you're saying is like you feel like you've made good progress, and it's, I think, or what do you think that.
17:05:28 What do you think that is,
17:05:32 um, I think it goes hand in hand with like the daily messages like the reminders, as well as having to check in with somebody, so it's not just myself that I'm doing it for I mean it's kind of like you have that person that eventually you have to report
17:05:49 to at the end of the week and it feels crappy to be like I didn't do it versus like you just knowing you didn't do it.
17:05:58 Hmm. And, yeah, noticing the differences I mean when we first started I was struggling with like sleeping. I had like low energy my stress levels are high so now it feels good god.
17:06:11 Like all that is improving. So it's motivating me to continue.
17:06:19 No. Oh, yeah. so feels good.
17:06:25 Um, I say yes to everything you've shared and I also wonder like.
17:06:32 I remember when we first met you had mentioned like like the five I want to wake up at 5am and do everything. And then this kind of like made it more like obtainable like your goals more obtainable.
17:06:50 And so it was just not realistic.
17:06:53 I mean, not right now. I feel like I had to wake up earlier in order to get everything done but it was really that I was just not prioritizing my task and I was kind of just winging it day by day but now having it like okay these days I have to do this.
17:07:10 That means on the other days I have to do this so it just helps me time management, better versus thinking, I had to make more time in my schedule already.
17:07:23 Yeah.
17:07:24 I'm so like on top of that, we were able to do like short term goals that help you meet your long term goal.
17:07:34 Because it's not just like, okay, day one, and you do everything it's.
17:07:45 Exactly.
17:07:47 Yeah, the aiming for like the moon. When I just needed to do something small, in order to see, and have that motivation like okay to keep going versus getting discouraged like crap I didn't need it today, huh.
17:08:12 Yeah, well I think you've been doing really great. I'm kicking ass honestly, yeah.
17:08:10 Feels good.
17:08:13 Um, so let me circle back and ask you about the text messages because you did mention how like the text messages have like helped you make this progress.
17:08:25 Um, how, why messages stood out to this week.
17:08:32 No, let me see him.
17:08:50 It reminded me to eat my.
17:08:54 Geez.
17:08:56 Today, for lunch gonna have some for dinner.
17:09:00 And then one other ones do something fun on Saturday. That was a good one. That's Sunday I had a girls day with my best friends. And we had to leave like went out to eat.
17:09:16 And just had like a good time.
17:09:20 Like this week was more on like self care and doing things I think outside of like what my health goals necessarily are, but it also was important to like remember that stuff like to spend time with people to do something for yourself something fun, eat
17:09:41 good cuz I mean, yeah, yeah, going to the gym and all that's great but if you're eating McDonald's out there, you're not going to feel that good.
17:09:52 So, yeah, it was nice. This week's we're good. All of them.
17:09:57 Cool.
17:10:00 Um, so I did write some stuff down, and I like that you had your girls day, those are nice.
17:10:08 Yes, opening up. Yeah, much needed.
17:10:14 Cool.
17:10:17 So, did any of them, or I guess in terms of like your health goals for this week where do you want to go.
17:10:27 Um, for sure. I'm going to go Friday, I'm going to try to go tomorrow.
17:10:40 And Monday.
17:10:52 I'm going to aim for three this week. Okay. And then, last time I think we did it for 45 minutes.
17:10:57 Hmm. Do you want to do it for 45 minutes, three times.
17:11:01 Yeah, let's do that.
17:11:14 And then you said
17:11:25 Um, let's see.
17:11:27 So
17:11:32 was I gonna ask, Is there any thing that you need, like you haven't blocked off on your calendar Do you need to put a calendar reminder.
17:11:48 No, I mean those are just the days I work with my work schedule right now so like Monday I'm off.
17:11:48 Friday I'm not working till the evening so I'm going to go in the morning and then tomorrow.
17:11:53 I'm going to go after class at night.
17:11:58 Cuz I'm gone for the weekend so Saturday and Sunday, I will be out of town so I don't even going to count on those days.
17:12:09 So it's, it's realistic.
17:12:11 Yeah, like those are days that I'm like okay these are guaranteed days for now.
17:12:17 And then if I can add like a Tuesday, or next Wednesday, then I will, but three for sure this week for 45 minutes.
17:12:27 Okay, cool.
17:12:29 So, I guess for like the relevance piece. I know you mentioned some stuff before but would you want to add anything to as to why this is important to you.
17:12:45 I think it's just to keep that motivation and just that like weekly.
17:12:52 I guess accountability to do something I least half of the week or the majority of the days, so just to stay in that rhythm of like doing something every week and not having too many days where I get discouraged to not do anything.
17:13:18 Mm hmm.
17:13:08 Just kind of like I just have to stay in the rhythm of it until it just becomes I guess second nature where I don't need so much like setting blocks in my schedule for it, it just kind of hand in hand.
17:13:24 Yeah, so make it make that behavior change just yeah Joel, have a yeah more stick habit turned more into like a habit versus I do list.
17:13:37 So just having healthy habits.
17:15:02 Thank you froze.
17:15:07 Sorry I got disconnected. It's okay.
17:15:11 I didn't hear what your confidence level was nine.
17:15:33 Okay, what what what's preventing a 10.
17:15:33 Hi, I feel like 10 just like, I don't know.
17:15:37 I'm.
17:15:37 I mean it could be a 10. My thesis maybe Monday might be tired from this weekend trips, so even though I have the day off I might spend that day like doing laundry and all that.
17:15:46 So just depending. It's more like Monday.
17:15:50 I might have to switch it to Tuesday.
17:15:53 But I do have Monday off right now so we really want to fit it in that day.
17:15:59 Okay.
17:16:02 I think that that makes sense that makes sense. It's not about the availability or your commitment or your any of that it's just more like sometimes you don't quite know how the week is going to play out.
17:16:17 So,
17:16:23 I know I'm gonna do at least
17:16:29 you're gonna do at least what I'm sure.
17:16:36 Three days.
17:16:38 Gotcha.
17:16:38 Okay.
17:16:42 Um, yeah I feel like the internet connectivity is making everything really awkward so I apologize.
17:16:53 It's okay.
17:16:55 Mine's like pretty unstable to hate it. But thanks for working with me.
17:17:11 Um, so, was it was there anything else that you wanted to, um, work towards this week.
17:17:14 We're just focused on the one will know just that one goal.
17:17:23 No, just that one goal. Because I go, my works with all the other.
17:17:31 Sorry. Oh, okay. I see we're saying yeah if I do not want all the other ones will kind of fall into place.
17:17:39 Make sense.
17:17:42 So I'm wondering out for for the intervention like we are hoping that you're gaining skills around like gold planning in general, do you feel like you're gaining that skill.
17:18:01 Yeah, I feel that
17:18:12 realistic goals, versus going like, maybe where I want to be in the future doing little baby steps that will get me there.
17:18:21 And normally I just go for like the end goal, like, Okay, this is it. So, teaching me to set realistic goals, and then later once those become more like habits I can increase it to something a little bit more intense versus just going full blown life
17:18:41 lifestyle change.
17:18:44 You know night yeah like going black and white like okay doing little baby steps.
17:18:53 Huh.
17:18:55 Cool. Um, And then, I don't know if you knew but we have one last health coaching session.
17:19:14 Sorry, did you hear that.
17:19:17 I just heard you say we have and then they just cut off. Oh, we have one health coaching session left. What next week or last one.
17:19:29 I believe so this was the third time that we're meeting.
17:19:32 Wow, it's gone by so fast.
17:19:41 And so, I think we're not we're going to talk about this next time but start considering like how, how you want to move forward beyond the program.
17:19:56 But, and then for scheduling purposes. do you want to meet at this time next week.
17:20:05 On Wednesday.
17:20:08 Yeah, that's your work at five.
17:20:11 Yeah. Oh it's Cinco de Mayo, maybe something to consider.
17:20:24 I could also meet earlier in the day if that works for you.
17:20:29 Yeah, unfortunately, um, I can either meet like really early in the morning like ATM, or I can meet up after 5pm.
17:20:42 Okay, because of your job.
17:20:45 Yeah.
17:20:51 So
17:20:51 I think the evening should work.
17:20:54 Unless you want to do eight in the morning I'm open to that too. If you want to do a morning one.
17:21:01 You know what what works better with your schedule.
17:21:15 Probably. Their equal honestly, because I start work in the morning but I work from home so I mean already be on my laptop it's really up to you. And I get off at four so
17:21:32 I'll go ahead and put us down for five o'clock and if I can get off a work early that day. I'll message you all I'll text you and say we can meet earlier.
17:21:42 Okay. Does that work out. Yep.
17:21:45 Okay, cool. And they'll send you a Google calendar invite tonight. Any questions before we sign off.
17:21:55 Now I think we got it.
