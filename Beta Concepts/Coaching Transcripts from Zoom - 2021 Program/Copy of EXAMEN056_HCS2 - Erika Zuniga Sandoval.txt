15:31:03 Hello, going.
15:31:08 Oh, hi.
15:31:09 Hi Alex so blurry.
15:31:11 I look so blurry. It's probably the lighting.
15:31:15 Sometimes the way where that you said, kind of effects at all.
15:31:20 It's true.
15:31:21 I'm doing okay I just finished last session so that I'm done for the day.
15:31:32 Yeah. What about you, it's warm in San Jose today. Yeah, again take
15:31:42 it.
15:31:43 Yeah, it's just more of pretty I feel like it's pretty the sun I was outside during lunch and I was like I need to get some sun and the sun is pretty strong.
15:31:52 My dad just recently fixed like put some like layer of something on the roof so I feel like it keeps the, the house a little bit more cooler. So that's, that's the good thing about that.
15:32:05 I have a fan, and I've been thinking about turning it on but first I need to clean it because I haven't turned it on in a while so I'm really dusty and have allergies.
15:32:16 allergies worse cleaning first. Yeah, but I put it for a living.
15:32:20 But, but we're here for you today. We're here to check in and see how did you do during the week, how your goals went.
15:32:30 So did you do. So, I feel I'm going to move seats because I need the charger. I feel like I did pretty good on, I kept up with my
15:32:44 with meditating actually meditated every morning.
15:32:49 So working out how active, I did it on Tuesday, Thursday I didn't do it, but I did it on Friday morning do it on Thursday I woke up super late, and then I was like, I still have to get it done.
15:33:08 So are you ready to do it on two days during the week so you were able to do the two days. Yeah, I did it on Friday and then I did it on Saturday as well.
15:33:16 Yeah. And so you did the two days and different days.
15:33:22 Oh, three days so you actually get more than you thought you are Yeah, yeah, pretty good.
15:33:30 Yeah, I was like I gotta, I gotta report back so I need to do it.
15:33:33 Awesome. So in terms of the progress itself. If you could give it a rating between Oh, have one that's a great and a 10 great, how, how do you feel that you didn't meeting your goals.
15:33:46 Well in meeting my goals I those two goals I added 10. Yes, I would say, a nine, because I met them but I feel like.
15:34:02 Like, I wish I would have been more intentional about them, specifically the movie my body one like I feel I feel like I, I kind of put it in there because there happened to be time, but I want to prioritize it stick to the days and times because yeah
15:34:21 I just, I feel like I need to prioritize it because then if I'm not prioritizing them prioritizing myself.
15:34:28 Yeah. Very true. Very true. Yeah, that's a very good point.
15:34:32 Thank you. And in terms of your level of stress I know there were a few things that came out there were some really good things that came up your, yes.
15:34:41 Congratulations.
15:34:44 And what was your stress level during the week for one not so stressed 10 stress.
15:34:52 Um, I think this week.
15:34:54 It was probably a four.
15:35:00 A stressed, yeah I wasn't very stressed. I think some of the things I stressed me out was like my professor hasn't like put the final assignment instructions the vignette that we have to do, and it's due on Saturday so I'm like come on home girl like
15:35:16 post it already, so I was a little stressful because I was trying to figure it out and everything on canvas is like this organized but other than that, the I think that the job application process I don't know if I talked to you about how I'm starting
15:35:29 to look for jobs anymore about how your, your search.
15:35:35 Okay, so it's going good, because I have, I feel like once you have the resume the cover letter down like it's easier for you to just adjust it and then apply, but I feel like last week I avoided it completely, like completely avoided it so dad brought
15:35:53 a little bit of, like, stress, to me because I kept going in circles about it but then I was also like I gotta be kind to myself It's okay, it'll get done.
15:36:04 But yeah, I feel like what alleviated it was that one of my professors asked me if I was interested in a position that's open and Santa file, which is not where I live.
15:36:15 So I spoke to the lead counselor about it and it went pretty well. So I think I was like okay like things are coming up. And I know that I will be aligned with something.
15:36:29 So, and then one of my sisters also told me about how the district is opening up like a bunch of different positions for counselors as well. So I think that's what it's alleviating the stress like the jobs are there.
15:36:44 You just got to apply.
15:36:46 Yeah.
15:36:47 Yes. If you do not apply. There's no way, in a good job right that day, I always tell my sister, people are not just gonna come to your door, and tell you hey here's a job for you read get apply.
15:37:02 So what are you hoping to check in about today, I know you mentioned a little bit about what's going on with, with the dove hunting, but is there something specific, and that completely affects your stress level and mental well be.
15:37:18 But is there other aspects that you wanted to check in about today. I think is is like I'm in this funk, because I gained so much weight since quarantine and I really want to lose weight.
15:37:29 And so I keep going in circles about like, I want to lose weight but then I'm also telling myself like okay that's not the way to approach it like you got you want to be more healthy you want to make more healthy decisions, but it's really hard for me
15:37:40 to commit to healthier, like I'm gonna be completely honest with you, like it's I struggle a lot specifically in the weekends I just like eat things that I probably shouldn't be eating because it has a lot of salt or has a lot of sugar and it's tough
15:37:57 because I feel like I guilt trip myself about it afterward.
15:38:02 So I'm kind of always in this circle of like okay you did good this week, keep it up and then somehow I mess it up and then I just.
15:38:09 Instead of saying okay tomorrow's a new day I kind of just keep going downhill. So I struggle with that a lot and I feel like it does kind of impact my mental health because I go in these like cycles of like I need to lose weight but I don't really need
15:38:23 to I want to but if it's not going to make me any happier like, you know, but like, Yeah, I just get in my head a lot, but that i mean it's it's a normal part of making changes right sometimes we we sit in that ambivalence of it all right.
15:38:40 That's how I would call it, but I think having a understanding of why it is important for you to do it, maybe asking those questions a little bit more like the why.
15:38:55 And then, the goal setting that we're doing can help us to make those small changes the small gradual changes, and it can be very overwhelming. I think that's something that I hear that you want to start you're not sure where to start, you have good days
15:39:11 but then there's like setbacks.
15:39:14 And that's part of change. I mean it's part of the process of changing. Yeah. When we think about like stages of change, we don't just go in one linear direction and then hey it's all good.
15:39:28 There's that loop that sometimes brings us back to the beginning and when you pre contemplation all over again.
15:39:36 So I, I do.
15:39:39 I hear you. Absolutely.
15:39:41 So I would say that in.
15:39:45 And the purpose of getting you started and thinking about it we can start with these small goals that we said, so you've been working on meditation right to help that stress and anxiety and everything else that's going on.
15:40:00 You started working on physical activity and those two things in themselves can move you forward. Yeah. And in the change that you want to be.
15:40:14 And I would say, you could start with physical activity and just make that consistent and keep going with that, before you think about adding something else, more you can add something else and then figure out how, how to schedule things in, but I would
15:40:33 absolutely just mentioned how you don't want to try to do too much, all at once, if that makes sense and I think it's like I get in the past I've tried to just isn't working out and it helped me out with like alleviating stress I would go to CrossFit,
15:40:49 but then I stopped going because of the pandemic and I couldn't afford it anymore because of school. So, I feel like that kind of, like, put me in this funk of like, oh my god I'm not working out like can you do something and I told myself okay.
15:41:02 Let's just eat healthier and cleaner, because everyone says that it's like 80% 70% or the percentages but it's more about like what you eat what you consume then the working out.
15:41:13 And so I think I would want to invest my energy in that a little bit more the consumption of the food of what I'm eating more than the physical activity for now.
15:41:24 I feel like that will make me feel a little bit better, like mentally internally, because I there are times where I just feel really exhausted when I'm not eating good.
15:41:33 So yeah.
15:41:37 And I think what I'm hearing is the, this idea of the 8020 is that, yeah. Some of us have heard something like that, or. Yeah. And even with, let's say you want to focus on the foods that you're consuming, we can make a SMART goal around that we can think
15:41:55 about is it that you want to include more. I heard you talking about me eating and what does that mean to you, doesn't mean eating more of a certain food less of a certain food.
15:42:11 During the week like for one meal. So we can feel like I that's where I get lost.
15:42:15 I'm like, I don't know, wider, what would you want to start with, let's start with something small that the chief mobile.
15:42:25 Hmm.
15:42:27 Let me, let me just do this.
15:42:30 What do you typically have in the morning.
15:42:32 So in the morning, I usually have eggs, like scrambled eggs with a sometimes public caught I'm not really a fan of avocado by country I forced myself to eat it because it will technically, yeah.
15:42:47 The fruit well because as a seed, I don't know. The dilemma is there.
15:42:52 So like avocado and then I put sometimes I put like a toast to make me feel a little bit more full, and then I'll have like my Macia tea ice cut off coffee.
15:43:06 So I've been doing maturity, or green tea.
15:43:12 And if I, if I don't have any time.
15:43:15 I don't eat until lunchtime.
15:43:18 So, it's either eggs with toast and tea or nothing.
15:43:24 You can see and about how many days a week, do you actually eat a morning meal.
15:43:41 So, because of this new transition I'm on campus. Now, I, I have not been like giving myself enough time. So because I was used to like rolling out of bed and now it's like work time right and now I have to actually go to work.
15:43:51 So before I eat breakfast, six times out of 766 days of the week.
15:44:01 But last week, I probably have breakfast.
15:44:06 Three times or four times, probably three times because I didn't have.
15:44:11 So that could be a start right that could be instead of.
15:44:15 I want to have practice X amount of days.
15:44:21 And and we can talk about what are some ideas of things that you can prepare especially because you mentioned that if not you're going into the office.
15:44:29 Is it something that you can prepare the night, warm so that you just grab and go.
15:44:35 And if, if that's I know my read I know for sure that I eat lunch so let's do that then we can talk about how do we, because part of, when you think about, because you mentioned weight and weight management when you think about weight.
15:44:50 Also think about the fact that your body does need to be right. And if we don't feed it, then we're going to be more likely to overeat when we do eat because now we're just starting.
15:45:01 And the likelihood of us making healthier choices at that point is very minimal.
15:45:07 So I mean I did try. I'm one of the last one of the days last week, I did overnight oats, so I put like peanut butter blueberries, strawberries, bananas, oatmeal and oat milk and honey.
15:45:23 And so I had that at work.
15:45:26 So that was that's doable. I can do that. And sometimes like I used to.
15:45:32 I used to like boiled eggs and I just put like to do in the morning, and I would eat that. Also, so I just I think it's this is a prioritizing myself part, because, like, if my partner is like oh let's go do this, I'll go do that I'll drop what I'm doing
15:45:49 If my parents are like you go to the store and get me this I'll drop what I'm doing. So I think it's the prioritizing myself, where I don't make time for this because I used to even meal prep for the same reason because I would like it's easier for you
15:46:03 to just be consistent when you meal prep because you have everything ready.
15:46:10 So in thinking about all those different topics, what would be something that you want to focus on for this week. I heard a few things I heard meal prep.
15:46:24 I heard prioritizing, which can help with the meal prep heard well sometimes I'm like eating in the morning, or bad.
15:46:30 What are you thinking, or is it something completely different that you want to start with. No, I want to meal prep why because I'm going to Costco after our session.
15:46:39 So, I wanted no prep. Yes.
15:46:43 Now the thing is like, what, to make, like, I'm going to back you up even further. Yes, yes. What to me but how much time do you spend actually doing the meal for.
15:47:00 In the past I mean it takes me probably like to actually cook.
15:47:05 Probably like an hour and 30.
15:47:08 So, because what I'm thinking is we need a specific action right so it could be.
15:47:15 I'm trying to kind of think of the steps to get us there. So it could be that you have to go shopping right and that's part of meal prepping, you're going to shop for certain amount of items, or for specific items and dedicating grocery shopping time
15:47:31 can be an activity in itself. The other thing I'm thinking is you're going to have to cook the food or prepare the food. So spending you mentioned an hour and a half on.
15:47:42 And then you can let me know which days of the week of what day of the week doing the actual meal prep.
15:47:48 And then you brought up. Well, I need to know what to prepare. So, thinking of when you're doing your meal prep, are you going to, when are you going to make time to figure out how your meals are going to look of what you want to make.
15:48:02 Okay, I think.
15:48:05 I think I want to focus on Mondays. Okay, because Mondays is my internship day as a clinician so I have more flexibility.
15:48:16 Because if I say Sundays I know for a fact there's not going to happen because it's like I want to rest I want to chill, like I'm not trying to cook.
15:48:25 No, so you'll spend an hour and a half by Monday meal prepping. Well if it doesn't include the grocery shopping so probably two hours.
15:48:43 to two hours because you're doing the grocery shopping today.
15:48:46 Okay. And your goal will be to do two hours Monday, are you going to do it Monday in the morning, in the afternoon. Well, that's more flexible time probably in the evening.
15:48:57 Okay.
15:48:58 Yeah.
15:49:02 What else can we add to it to make it more specific meal prepping and breakfast.
15:49:10 Very good.
15:49:19 read this for for just Monday's meals or for the rest of the week for Tuesday through Friday.
15:49:32 Okay.
15:49:32 What.
15:49:38 That's a great goal. Thank you, motivate me.
15:49:43 Pull your motivating me so.
15:49:45 No, I'm still working from home today I completely understand you. I can just go to the kitchen, make my make my egg come back. He doesn't like checking email.
15:49:56 Yeah, I can wear anything I don't have to make a change. So, by the way, I'm not very personable.
15:50:05 And it's all good.
15:50:09 Okay, so we have no purpose bowl number one, is there something else that you were thinking of including or do we want to start with meal prep and see how that goes.
15:50:19 But I also want to keep the meditation. Okay, meditation, me.
15:50:27 I have that on here.
15:50:30 So you'll practice 10 minutes, three days of the week.
15:50:36 Yeah, we can do three days of the week, they
15:50:42 do one quick thing here,
15:50:48 very consistent to its inception, and how. Going back to the meal prep.
15:50:56 How confident. Do you feel that you can do that on a scale of one to 10.
15:51:05 Um, I feel, I feel confident turn.
15:51:09 Yeah.
15:51:11 Let me know what you end up getting for for your shopping, like your grocery shopping list. If you want to create a shopping list.
15:51:21 Okay, that we can do.
15:51:24 I think I want to I'll probably want to look up some guy wanted to same deal because I feel like every time that I do that I'm like, I don't want to eat there's no more.
15:51:32 So I kind of want to mix it up. Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday. I can't do it Saturday because off school.
15:51:41 Yeah, so I think I want to Google some stuff, and then I'll connect with what
15:51:48 and how confident, do you feel about continuing the meditation, the meditation I feel confident Nestle solid son.
15:51:57 Solid son. Yeah, I think I literally can I can do these things it's just a matter of like, because you're holding me accountable, that I will follow through.
15:52:07 Like, it's okay but like I want to eventually be able to do that by myself.
15:52:12 And it makes me think about like how do we create a kind of the living within ourselves.
15:52:18 Yeah.
15:52:24 We're gonna I'm gonna ask, I'm going to talk about that, during my therapy session. Hey, if you get any insights.
15:52:32 Right, right, right.
15:52:34 Okay, so I have to go. Continue with meditation, you know, practicing.
15:52:42 Those are very good.
15:52:44 Any other successes that you want to share that you had during the week any other challenges that you're facing.
15:52:51 Um,
15:52:56 I think the only challenge is like the weekend part where I just like I call out so I.
15:53:04 He obviously and so I feel like I want to be more mindful about how much I'm consuming because I feel this need to eat the whole thing all the time because like being raised I was always I would get in trouble if I didn't finish my food.
15:53:19 And so now I feel like I struggle to like to portion myself. Because of that I feel like I need to just eat it all.
15:53:29 Yeah, I don't I don't want to have to feel the need to eat it all, or feel like I can't stop eating until I physically feel full.
15:53:38 You know, so that's something else that comes up for me often.
15:53:42 That's a very interesting point that you bring up that as as kids sometimes we're told you know you have to eat all your food.
15:53:49 Yeah, it's a bit of a disservice that we're doing to our kids to when we're not letting them understand how to know when they're full right because we are asking them to go beyond that point and by men.
15:54:05 And thinking about, we mentioned portions to.
15:54:09 Do you have a pretty good understanding of like servings. vs. vs portions and how all that works.
15:54:17 Let me see if I can find some resources, because I know that's a topic that sometimes we sort of, nothing too much about, but just like a little quick thought is that go portion is what you actually put on your plate so when you actually eat and observing
15:54:34 is what we use to measure the nutritional value of something.
15:54:38 So I don't know if I mentioned to you this before but for example the serving size of a rice is a third of us.
15:54:49 Yeah, and a third of a cup has 15 grams of carbohydrates.
15:54:49 But then if we, let's say the portion that I want to eat is a cup of rice. I can eat a cup of rice, but then I'm eating 45 grams of carbohydrates and eating three times, the one third.
15:55:02 Yeah. So in thinking about that. It can help us to figure out, well, how much am I eating versus in am I eating like too much of something or not enough of something, right.
15:55:15 Yeah, cuz I feel like I don't eat enough of veggies and fruits I feel like my proteins usually pretty good. I try to be my full of the carbs.
15:55:25 But, like the veggies and fruit portion like I feel like I don't really have much of a like I'm a meat person, which I am trying to, like, reduce the amount of meats I consume but, yeah, I'm just so last week, I think I added something but a healthy play
15:55:47 play Did you find that useful health in my, in my become useful this week as you're doing your meal planning, all the picture one.
15:55:58 I think it's a video, a video, let me check and see.
15:56:35 no, I didn't get a video.
15:56:39 What is it, yeah I didn't get a link. Do you see.
15:56:43 Do you see that how to create a healthy plate.
15:56:48 That should be like a hyperlink that takes you to a video.
15:56:52 But it should have it attached at the bottom that's so strange, maybe broke or something.
15:57:00 How to create a healthy plate you saw me see.
15:57:06 Yeah, it was on the health coaching session one follow up email, or email. No.
15:57:17 Okay, so when it comes to the emails first cohort.
15:57:21 I don't keep up.
15:57:24 Okay, well, you are a resource and I think it can help you with thinking about your meal planning to.
15:57:32 Okay. And it talks a little bit about portions and serving.
15:57:38 And so I'm sorry it's under examined.
15:57:49 It's the title of it. Yes, it comes from the excitement to settle with that GMO.
15:57:51 It's from April 24.
15:57:56 Oh, I see it. Okay. There it is.
15:58:03 Okay, so I'll watch that.
15:58:07 Yeah, I think it's very short.
15:58:09 I think it's it's it's a little bit.
15:58:13 Maybe I think it's, it was created for maybe like a way younger audience, but I found it really cute.
15:58:22 Oh it's by Kaiser Permanente yeah okay yeah I'll watch it.
15:58:28 And I say, and I'm like, oh my gosh this is so cute cute it's like a little hard talking about, Oh, I love these types of videos, and I mean I just think it's a good way to maybe if there's like anyone in the family that you wanted to share with I think
15:58:43 it's very applicable in English, though, so I'm pretty sure I mean it's Kp so I'm thinking they might even have it in other languages. Yeah.
15:58:56 But for this week I'll, I'll find something that talks a little bit more about specifically about portions and servings. And, and try to do that. So at the end of every session when I send you a summary of goals.
15:59:08 I do that through email, and I try to add additional resources so just let me know if if it works. If you have preferred a different way cuz I know we can also text and but I know for like the bigger items like attachments and things like that it's definitely
15:59:22 easier to do three little Yeah, emails, emails Fine, I'll look at it now.
15:59:28 It's because I get so many emails from like all these events and like USF calendar and Career Services I'm just like, so I one of the things that I've done through Canvas.
15:59:41 I have to go on campus and check under that group to see what notifications are posting, not sure that's a good advice.
16:00:06 Any other questions that I have anything. Oh yes, the messages that you receive this week, any that stood out to you.
16:00:16 Um, I really, I think the women took a look at them right now and then, he responded to a few
16:00:30 remember getting notification.
16:00:34 Oh, the why it's important to know your why remind yourself every day why you want to eat healthy and stay active.
16:00:43 And we talked about that a little bit today. Yeah.
16:00:55 The do something fun.
16:01:02 Yeah.
16:01:08 also really like that picture of the to be an active person get their mental, physical activity every day.
16:01:18 That's very inclusive, exercise, our purple lady, we call Yes, yes.
16:01:25 Yeah,
16:01:37 we had, we, we really worked hard and making sure that any images that we use were absolutely said, but also that spoke to just our own diversity as some woman and the man.
16:01:52 doing, you're doing great. I love it and appreciate it.
16:01:58 Any other thoughts.
16:02:01 No that's I think that's it for me.
16:02:03 Well you have said two very good goals for this upcoming week, I'll send you a summary of what those will be. And I'll add a few resources. Okay, with meal prepping.
16:02:19 Sounds good and think of things that you've done before that has helped you, because you've done it before. And, yeah, you better make it work before.
16:02:28 So, yeah, I have I think I just need to follow through. Yeah, and anything that you need to dedicate some time like carve out some time to do it. Yeah, we're just magically.
16:02:39 I know, you're right.
16:02:41 Well, thank you so much. My was really good to see you. All I know we do need to schedule our session three, guess what are you thinking, um, you said you can't do Sundays.
16:02:53 Let me see some things that are open.
16:02:56 Yeah, I could do a Sunday.
16:03:03 Yeah, this Sunday is Mother's Day.
16:03:06 Most likely listen to somebody
16:03:18 Okay, so I.
16:03:22 We can do Saturday, 1011, one
16:03:29 at 1pm because I have a break at that time.
16:03:37 I'll send you the calendar invite. Okay.
16:03:43 If anything comes up for me. Okay. did you get to see your, your nephew.
16:04:06 No, no, yeah, I they're kind of going to wait a couple of days until we can physically see him.
16:03:58 I've seen pictures but that's all. Yeah. and I also went to a wedding. So
16:04:08 was that know how was it. Oh, it was. I mean, I was really nervous about it because like I was like okay nobody's gonna probably wear their masks, but I mean my partner and I wore masks.
16:04:21 It was fun, it was cool but towards the end of it they had been that it was outside. So when we're dancing by now or just kind of soul over x were hella sweating so we took it off.
16:04:30 So I also want to like I am we get tested tomorrow and then I'm a wait some days because I would feel like more like responsible if I just wait it out.
16:04:41 Yeah, but it was a good time I was like oh my god has been so long.
16:05:01 Yeah, I think, trying to do things that at some point we're normal right now after this pandemic it's, it's going to be a little different.
16:04:59 We celebrated someone's birthday here at the house and it was all outdoors, it was only like maybe 10 of us, but it still felt really strange. Everyone was wearing a mask and like they were like eating or drinking something, but it was just this year.
16:05:18 Exactly. Are you hear somebody like cough or sneeze and you're like, oh, like, yeah, yeah.
16:05:27 Wonder my housemates was telling me after how she was feeling like headache and stuffy nose and in my mind I'm like oh my gosh Did someone brand new virus
16:05:38 allergies.
16:05:40 In my mind I'm thinking yeah, it goes like 1000 miles per hour you started thinking of all these things yeah but I mean it is allergy season, technically, but I think you bring up a good point that it's important to just be cautious and if you feel that,
16:05:55 okay, I just need to double check it's good to do that. Right, exactly. So then I should be getting my results, I'ma go tomorrow and Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday, probably by Thursday evening, and then Friday I'm going for my Maxine shot.
16:06:13 My second dose. Okay.
16:06:16 And when you look pretty had one vaccine so that should have given you some protection.
16:06:21 Right.
16:06:23 All right, but I'm still paranoid.
16:06:26 Because I feel so guilty.
16:06:28 Like if I was to, you know, spread it with my family. Yeah, absolutely.
16:06:34 I totally get it. Yeah.
16:06:37 Thank you.
