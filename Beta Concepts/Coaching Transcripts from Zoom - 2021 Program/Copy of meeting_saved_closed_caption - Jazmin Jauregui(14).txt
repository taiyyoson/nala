17:16:47 And speaking of going by fast. This is our last health coaching session. I know, I don't have the rest of my calendar.
17:16:58 Um, so, this session, honestly is pretty much very are very similar to our other coaching sessions. There's just instead of scheduling a follow up like a session number five.
17:17:12 We're going to do an interview and.
17:17:17 And just so that you have the opportunity to share your experience about participating in the program. Okay, so we can schedule that later, but why would you want to start today, do let's talk about the messages stress or your goals.
17:17:36 We're going to start
17:17:38 my stress level is okay right now I'm not stressing about anything at the moment.
17:17:45 I think just because the week just started.
17:17:48 And tomorrow maybe they'll change for my house I can you give me a number one through five.
17:17:57 Five, not there.
17:18:03 Sorry, and you're saying, for my goals so last week I took my vitamins, every day.
17:18:10 So, even if I even if I like I think one day I didn't take them at 10, but I didn't take the notification off so it kept reminding me, but I took them.
17:18:23 Even though was in at 10am but I took them every day. So I did what I told you like that with the water bottle next to my vanity and then I put the three bottles right there like the right there.
17:18:33 Let me show you
17:18:40 the right very nice. Yeah, in your face. Yes.
17:18:50 Nice. Yeah, in your face. Yes. So they're right there so it worked out for me.
17:18:54 Cool. So for that one. On a scale of one to 10.
17:19:00 So 10 Plus I did everything.
17:19:04 I didn't want to make assumptions, but I would tend to. Oh, awesome. So how are you feeling like after like 10 out of 10, or seven out of seven days.
17:19:19 I feel good and I feel confident like I think I, I know I can do it I can continue doing it.
17:19:37 Yeah, I'm
17:19:32 just gonna ask something.
17:19:37 I forgot the newest Okay, Cool. Thank you.
17:19:42 Um, so, for the text messages. This week, um, do you have any comments about those like, Did any of them stand out.
17:19:52 Did any of the motivate you.
17:19:55 Yes Let me look for it. There was one unlimited
17:20:03 works.
17:20:07 All I remember my other question, but I'll tell you in a second.
17:20:17 I think it was about the veggies.
17:20:23 Oh, I hate it. Well I'm only so much that they I think she make God oh my goodness you didn't get a text message today. Did you
17:20:33 know I just got your reminder.
17:20:47 It was my but I didn't schedule any messages today, or let me double check. I don't think I did. No, I totally forgot to do it last night. Then, I just got your,
17:20:53 your reminder for today.
17:20:57 I just sent you a message today. I'm so sorry,
17:21:04 what was the other question.
17:21:06 So the veggie but the big one was the one that you liked, yeah.
17:21:14 Anything else about the text messages though.
17:21:20 For me like I love them because it's just like, I'm excited sometimes we need a reminder that we have to take care of ourselves and for me getting that in the morning, it's, it's very important like I think it helps me start my day.
17:21:36 Good especially I think you send some like like the little pictures.
17:21:41 Those are also nice.
17:21:50 Um, and then my question for you before when we were just talking about like your health goal for last week. Was there anything that you that you think you did that helps you meet your goal, like I know having them like next year event and he might have
17:22:02 been helpful. Was there anything else.
17:22:06 helpful. Was there anything else. Um, well, the little reminder that you add it to my calendar
17:22:13 calendar reminder cool.
17:22:17 Do you feel like
17:22:21 maybe that that's something that you would continue to do.
17:22:24 Yeah.
17:22:26 Guys, I need it.
17:22:29 Okay, cool.
17:22:36 Um, So, any other questions for me regarding.
17:22:38 Yeah, anything from like goals or what you want to focus on today for this week.
17:22:53 My focus would be for this week would be.
17:22:56 So I I'm, I'm doing like laser removal, laser hair removal, but for my underarms they tend to get dark if I shave. So I bought like I'm not consistent with greens like I put a cream under my under wrong so they can get lighter.
17:23:17 And I'm not consistent.
17:23:19 My goal for this week would be to just apply with them cream every night
17:23:26 cream application,
17:23:30 and has to be at night.
17:23:33 I prefer at night just because it's, I don't know if it's going to stay my clothing, and so like if I do it at night, I just, I put like like a tank top that I don't use out, and then I just go to sleep.
17:23:48 And is it.
17:23:49 It's not something that like you're supposed to like wipe off.
17:23:53 After 10 minutes or anything like that it's just no you just leave it on it's like a moisturizer.
17:23:58 Okay, cool.
17:24:00 Um, so, I guess, if you were to phrase that into a SMART goal, like how would you worded.
17:24:19 No.
17:24:21 So I'm here let me do.
17:24:25 Sorry, I have like so many tabs open, but I think previously when we were doing your helpful.
17:24:35 I had emailed them.
17:24:37 Yeah.
17:24:38 Let's see if I can just reference back one of your goals from the past.
17:24:50 To do
17:24:50 so, and then next week, you'll take your hair vitamins every day at 10am because you want your hair to grow and be longer.
17:25:01 So, I will apply my, um, it's called whitening cream.
17:25:10 Every night, around like a 9pm, the solution when I go to bed.
17:25:18 I'm to make my to help my underarms gay later.
17:25:26 And then, what, Why was it a goal important to you.
17:25:33 Because summers coming up.
17:25:36 I don't want to work things out.
17:25:40 Some deadline of summer.
17:25:43 And I'm paying for laser hair. So what's the point of paying for laser if I can show off my underarms right
17:25:54 show off.
17:26:00 And then.
17:26:06 So what are you going to do to help you achieve this goal.
17:26:13 So we're going to do.
17:26:19 I am going to put the cream in the bathroom. So when I shout, when I shower or brush my teeth, like, I know it's there. So I don't have an excuse.
17:26:31 If I'm going to the bathroom, might as well just do it.
17:26:36 Okay, so cream in the bathroom.
17:26:40 And then you're going to buy a flyer, yet. Yes, or brushing my teeth.
17:26:47 Brushing.
17:26:53 Um, so I know you said that calendar reminders were helpful. Do you want to do that again, or do you want to do like foam alarms, what, How do you want to track it.
17:27:10 I'm.
17:27:41 Okay.
17:27:55 Okay I did
17:28:03 anything else, I think anything else.
17:28:19 Um, no, I think that's it, because I want it one of my goals to be.
17:28:14 So I wash my face every morning and every night but sometimes. Um, I don't use like anything like just water, but I didn't, I got my eyebrows micro related so I can't fully like wash it.
17:28:29 So, I don't want to like any product like for this whole week I can't fully wash my face. So I know I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to do that one like the whole week.
17:28:41 I'm like washing your face for the whole weekend.
17:28:44 Okay, like to wash my face but now with any product, but I wanted to make one of my goals to add, like to add some, like I usually I usually wash my face with products right.
17:28:56 Um, but I'm not consistent. And I want to be consistent so this whole week, I can't wash my face with any products.
17:29:06 Hmm.
17:29:16 Yeah, so I'm wondering like what would it be like to pretend the products on. So like you say, it's something that's going to be a part of like your morning routine or your night routine or both, both.
17:29:26 So then it's like taking the time looking at the product for attending to apply it.
17:29:33 And then just getting into the habit. Yeah, that's one approach since you can't do anything on your face.
17:29:42 Or, that's a goal that you can focus on next week when you don't have.
17:29:49 For us first
17:30:07 this limitation that's gonna say yeah I think I'll try that. Next, I'll start what you told me right now and then I'll start the products next week. Okay.
17:30:05 Um, so for this goal around like the whitening cream for your underarms. What's your confidence level and meeting this SMART goal, on a scale of one to 10, to 10.
17:30:23 I wanted to be a 10. But you say really want this, or I'm going to say, like an eight.
17:30:32 But I really want it so I am going to make it happen for the full seven days.
17:30:37 Yeah. The other thing that might like motivate you, or help motivate you, I should say, is you can do like a before and after photo.
17:30:48 Or like take a photo every night. You don't necessarily have to send this to me if you don't want to, but maybe if you start to observe a difference like after two nights at all, middle like to show you that you can achieve the results that you want if
17:31:05 you just commit. Yeah, every night.
17:31:09 Um, would that be something you'd like to do or maybe. Yeah, and my observation.
17:31:15 I took a picture I took a picture of that yesterday.
17:31:20 I wanted to see the cream actually works because I had another one and it was costing like irritation. And it was sort of cheese so I had to buy a new one so I want to see this.
17:31:31 Yeah, definitely.
17:31:35 So I'll just say like maybe taking before and after photos. Mm hmm.
17:31:47 And then, were you wanting to set the same goal around like your hair vitamins this week to
17:31:57 that to keep the same one.
17:31:59 Yeah.
17:32:01 Okay, so then you'd have two goals.
17:32:06 Possibly.
17:32:06 In the next week.
17:32:09 You will, I forget how is it to take my vitamins.
17:32:16 My hair vitamins, to me.
17:32:22 And then, Do you have an alarm set for that already.
17:32:26 I can add it to my hair, I mean, to my cream. No, I need to make anyone
17:32:34 unless you want to change the time that you take that you do your hair creams but it might be easier to separate it so that you can track them separately.
17:32:44 Let me put it, let me leave it at 10 a year.
17:33:13 Okay.
17:33:18 I did it
17:33:22 for like the relevant piece to this goal.
17:33:27 What did you or how did you feel about like meeting your goal for this one for the hair vitamins Yeah, I would say I can now say attend because I did it.
17:33:43 But I guess more so to like I said you mentioned like feeling confident. I'm just like meeting your health goal help you feel confident. Did you observe any other like positive outcomes from, like either taking your vitamins every day, or like just feeling
17:34:05 accomplished that question makes sense.
17:34:19 A little bit.
17:34:13 So maybe I can give an example and then you can apply it to like the situation so, um, some participants have like set goals around drinking water. And then there, they would say like, oh, it, drinking or having set this goal helped me feel more hydrated,
17:34:32 or helped me feel like I can say no to sugary drinks. And so I'm wondering if like you know you having taking your hair vitamins every day is helping you feel some way whether it be like health wise or just like feelings wise.
17:34:56 Well, it did make me feel accomplish, and I just kept thinking like, I kept thinking up like about you, I don't know.
17:35:13 I can't let her down like when I also can't do myself down Oh, it's just a week, you know like, it's a little challenge and. And unlike them What if I like I have not.
17:35:17 I've accomplished a few of the other goals that I had but not fully for a week. I think like this is the first one right so yeah then make me feel like oh yeah you push yourself to ya vitamins is I'm like, they're right there.
17:35:34 Yeah, but it was hard because the big ones like they're this big. And it's hard for them to like for me to swallow them so it's like, oh, those were the ones that I was like, I don't want to take them.
17:35:48 But I was like if I cut them in half, it's like, it's twice a pain so might as well take one at it like that one.
17:35:58 Did you notice any differences within your like hair health.
17:36:07 Well I don't strain my hair like every day. I stopped, so like grow. And I heard all day yesterday, and it does look longer.
17:36:15 Oh, I took the vitamins before, but i like i like i said i've been trying to be consistent. So, I do see a difference so I yeah I have to keep taking the vitamins.
17:36:25 Um, did you like measure your hair before him.
17:36:29 Now yes.
17:36:30 Oh, so it's it's before I started, I got a haircut last year, I think, and my hair takes forever to grow. So if it was like a little bit below my bra.
17:36:44 And right now it's like close to my weight.
17:36:47 So, yeah.
17:36:50 Cool.
17:36:51 I think that would have been like another way to measure it to your progress. Cool. Well, like, just this one, I mean, I know you've been doing it off and on, but like this consistency like can help you get those.
17:37:08 Yeah, things you want. So, with the next goal that you are with your new goal for the week like getting the getting the pits to have a good summer.
17:37:23 Yeah, I'm almost here for you so they need to be white.
17:37:31 Oh fun. Do you have plans for the summer, like I going somewhere.
17:37:35 Um, no.
17:37:37 have summer class so I'm not going anywhere.
17:37:41 You're gonna be like,
17:37:47 going back to campus like no for enough for the fall semester or you're done and when are you done with school.
17:37:55 I was supposed to be doing for summer but I changed my classes last semester because they were just like a little too heavy for me know.
17:38:03 I'll be technically enrolled in summer.
17:38:07 They're trying to make me go in person, but I'll see what I can do about that.
17:38:14 What's your major.
17:38:15 I'm a Masters of Public Health student.
17:38:18 Okay.
17:38:20 Yeah, so you will be done in in the fall.
17:38:24 Yes.
17:38:25 Nice. You excited.
17:38:27 Yeah, definitely. I'm.
17:38:31 I think my brain needs a break.
17:38:34 What's your goal actor.
17:38:37 Um, I think for me it's still to be determined.
17:38:41 I think for a long time I didn't even see myself as a graduate student, so I needed the terms that I've already graduated.
17:38:49 Yeah, and to where I want to go like I have a good like full time job right now.
17:38:56 to where I want to go like I have a good like full time job right now. So I have a little bit of time to decide, like should I stay or should I. Yeah. Where do you work.
17:39:04 I work at UC Santa Cruz. Oh, nice. I'm, I'm one of the advocates there for survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and things like that so I meet with them and help them get through college, honestly.
17:39:19 Oh, that's nice.
17:39:21 Yeah, I love, I love doing all that my other job that I had I used to be an outreach specialist and I used to work for a community college, and I would go to different high schools and talk to you about about college.
17:39:35 And then just help them enroll and all that good stuff. So now with my job I still do the same thing for homeless youth.
17:39:44 Hmm, yeah. I'm excited to have for your program. I have.
17:40:01 I graduate next fall. No next next spring, huh, yeah, like start, I still have summer with three classes.
17:39:58 And then my, my training ship one class for the fall.
17:40:02 Hmm.
17:40:02 Well, yeah, It's a lot. It's.
17:40:06 Are you planning and returning in the fall, like in person.
17:40:11 That's the plan that's that's what they said.
17:40:15 So, because our campus is like super small.
17:40:18 I'm like we're going to die.
17:40:30 Well I don't know if it works but the classroom, the classroom, gets so hot like super hot, so they have to have like little fans like around the classroom.
17:40:42 And it doesn't work like this now work so our director said, we might be going live one Friday in person one Friday on zoom.
17:40:54 And my older was mad, they're like what's the point like we've been on zoom for this long.
17:41:00 But yeah, I think we might be going back is a, is that what you what are you ready to go back in person.
17:41:09 So we honest like I don't even care. I like, you know, I'm might like I said my daughter was mad. But first, they were complaining that we were online.
17:41:25 And we're paying like $10,000 a semester. And now that we're going back, they're complaining that we're going back and allow us me to get it together.
17:41:29 We're going to be split it's only 20 people like 20 of us in the cohort so it's going to be 10 and 10. So it's not like we're going to be crowded.
17:41:37 It's not gonna be super crowded like we're still gonna have space, but I don't know, I have a few Karen's in my cohort so
17:41:47 I'm so tired of them but yeah mind like I can do both flexible. Yeah. Yeah, and I think like the work that you do now, like it. Sometimes you do have to go in person and so like you're, you know that it's not as scary.
17:42:05 Yeah.
17:42:06 I am conflicted myself. I like because my most of my cohort is graduating already like like new people, but I'm also the traffic from Santa Cruz to San Francisco.
17:42:23 So we'll see. I only have to go, technically like eight times because it's like often on.
17:42:31 But, yeah, I'm not looking forward to having to wear a mask for Oh yeah, I think that's the part that gets me more hours my class is is from, from four to 10 six hours, yeah six our classes.
17:42:48 Yeah.
17:42:50 Like how good, how are people gonna like you can drink water.
17:42:56 That's what I'm worried about that's what I told my director I was like I'm just worried like the classrooms, they really hard like and we're going to be wearing a mask like how is this going to work out.
17:43:06 You know, so we'll see what happens.
17:43:10 Well good luck. Hopefully they come up with a good plan that is comfortable.
17:43:18 Considering the weather insane, considering the pandemic.
17:43:23 Yeah, good luck to you to what the traffic.
17:43:26 I know, that's okay.
17:43:29 Yeah, I don't have to think about that now.
17:43:32 It's for a future, it's a few, but I'm sorry I do have like a little bit more about the next steps.
17:43:44 Oh sorry, I do have like a little bit more about the next steps. So let me circle back to that because I know we're like nearing the end of our time together.
17:43:51 It's been so fun.
17:43:54 Um, but, like always, I'll send you an email, of the goals that you've set. Do you feel comfortable with those two or did you want to add another one.
