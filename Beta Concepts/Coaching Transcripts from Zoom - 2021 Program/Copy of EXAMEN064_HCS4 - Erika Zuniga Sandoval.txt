12:02:30 Hi, can you hear me yeah I hear you on your message right now. like, oh yeah.
12:02:39 Okay. Give me one second, so I can turn on the camera I don't know why it's not working.
12:02:44 You mentioned on your phone home.
12:02:47 Yeah, you have to give permission on settings for sue your camera, a lemon, have done that to where, if I joined through my phone, if I haven't given you permission, it won't.
12:03:07 They won't show it
12:03:08 through the camera right or
12:03:13 Where's it zoom. Sorry I'm trying to figure it out like that axis, maybe. Let me see. Let me see.
12:03:20 Oh, I found it I, yeah.
12:03:24 I don't know if you would have to log out and log back in or if it just automatically does it.
12:03:34 Oh sorry kicked me out but let me see if it works. Oh, there you go.
12:03:38 I have you twice. Nice.
12:03:40 Yeah, I think it's because then they have to like like you back in.
12:03:45 Oh, got it, got it. Okay, cool.
12:03:48 How are you today.
12:03:50 I'm good. I'm gas so today I was some supposed usually I'm working from home but I decided to, they decided to schedule me for a vaccination site so I'm here.
12:04:02 It's really slow and I'm on my break so it's okay, okay, okay. Well, today is our last coaching session. Sadly, so towards the end of today, I'll tell you a little bit more about next steps.
12:04:17 But before that, of course I want to hear how your goals went for the week.
12:04:23 How did you do.
12:04:25 I did really good, I was able to like work out and really stay focused, like on my health goals. And I think that was my main one right like like doing, keeping track of that.
12:04:40 Yeah, yeah, being able to exercise because you knew that your work schedule was going to be changing and you also have that additional job that you weren't going to be doing.
12:04:51 So you wanted to make sure you still have time to exercise. Yeah.
12:04:56 Yeah, so I did I'm really excited.
12:05:00 So I was able to do that. And today is the only day that I am not going to go to the gym.
12:05:08 But it's because finals are starting to creep up so I decided that, when like today will be my day Have a nice day outside I don't know in your area but it's actually pretty in San Francisco right now so I'm thinking.
12:05:22 Yeah, so I'm thinking of just like looking at my assignments and what to do and like really focusing on that.
12:05:31 No, that's good, that's good. And in thinking of the things that are coming up has has your stress and how is your stress this last week on a scale of one to 10, one that's a stress and 10 very stress.
12:05:44 I would say it without a falling for it wasn't as, it wasn't bad, much better, much better.
12:05:56 And, were there any messages that stood out to you this week.
12:06:01 Yes, just give me, I know I looked at, I looked at it so it was.
12:06:11 I like that I know I didn't respond exactly to it but actually like the self care bingo I thought that was really cute.
12:06:22 Yeah, that was a fun one to make, like the graphic itself, I was like wow like it's it's really, it's different. It's not just the,
12:06:33 Not just the sheet with things. Yeah, yeah.
12:06:43 Any others are that was the main one.
12:06:49 It was mostly the main wine that I that stood out to me. I also, I think it's more because of like I'm a visual person. So I actually really liked the, the one with the avocado bowl.
12:07:01 I'm like it.
12:07:04 Like, puts an image in your head of like, oh, maybe I should try like recreating that or like that looks good but then they'll have, you know like, okay, avocado looks good.
12:07:14 Like, I went in the fridge so let me add it to my like literal rice and stuff.
12:07:21 Okay, awesome.
12:07:22 So being that Today is our last session, what are you hoping to check in about today. And how can we continue to keep you on this path to stay on track of of your goals.
12:07:36 what are you thinking.
12:07:39 Um, I've been, I've been liking like the consistency that I feel I've been able to build.
12:07:50 I'm using things like writing down my intentions for the week or like my goals, but also I think my Apple Watch, using it more strategically it would be the word because before like I used to use the Apple Watch more for like aesthetic purposes like oh
12:08:04 yeah it's my watch and it's there. But now it's more like, I actually use the features that it offers you know I use the rings and I use the apple settings and I take advantage of like the free Apple fitness plus that allowed me to try virtual yoga and
12:08:24 like all these cool things that I wanted to always try but it allowed me to kind of just like dip my toe in like okay maybe I could do you know you'll get in person, or something like that.
12:08:33 Yeah.
12:08:36 Well, that's awesome.
12:08:38 And I think sometimes we forget all the things that it could come with right or the access. Yeah, that's good. So you mentioned you were able to try the virtual yoga What did you think of him.
12:08:53 Um, I really liked it the one I did was only 10 minutes which I think was perfect because it was a beginners yoga class and the way Apple sets it up is like, you don't need any equipment just, you don't even need a map, if you don't have one so that's
12:09:07 really cool it's very like in my point of view it's inclusive, but I luckily had a map already so they want to use that. And a lot of it was more like being present so it was like a lot of breath workout first, and then slowly transitioning into like
12:09:23 stretches and then doing like basic poses. And so it made me, ease into it a little bit more.
12:09:34 Yeah, I think that's a very good start and oftentimes we think of yoga is like automatically jumping into all these like stretches and like damn or dogs right.
12:09:47 Yeah, there's a lot of work behind it in terms of like the breathing aspect of it. So I think that's a very good first introduction to get to and.
12:09:57 Yeah.
12:10:00 So for this upcoming week.
12:10:03 What is something that you want to, or what is the goal that you want to set for yourself.
12:10:09 What are you thinking.
12:10:15 Um, for this upcoming week, I think it's going to be.
12:10:19 I want to stay in the same theme, you know that I've been in the past because I know, once I start doing something consistently and no longer has to be something that I have to purposely do but it just becomes like oh it's part of my like schedule.
12:10:35 So I want to be able to work some time in for my sweaty pursuit.
12:10:56 I call it like sweaty pursuit because it's not, it doesn't necessarily have to be at the gym you know it can be at home, or like, I live right next to Ocean Beach so it's like, even a walk there and back is like something that I can do.
12:11:01 So I think I want to stick with that in that in that schedule and keep the momentum of what I've been doing the past weeks, like, you know, stick.
12:11:10 Keep the keep the momentum of that physical activity going, and it can be in different ways like you said it could be through going to the gym or it could be through going for a walk.
12:11:20 So, having a variety of activities that you could do.
12:11:30 And how many days during the week do you plan to continue to practice like some type of physical activity.
12:11:39 My goal is minimum, five days a week.
12:11:44 Because I do want to lock myself, two days of like.
12:11:49 Also, 100% focus those two days on I finals that are coming up. So even though like I can do both right like schedule a time where I can pursue like a workout or, you know, active.
12:12:04 Like when I, I know that as a study like my studying habits, it's like if I started EDM. I just keep going all day and like that's how I get these done versus like carving out two hours.
12:12:16 It basically takes like two hours to like get in the mood to study so it's like I can't do that like I need a whole day to like get it going. Yeah.
12:12:26 And when you're thinking of doing this for five days a week. How much time do you want to a lot to it, like how much activity time do you want to set aside for think an hour is pretty like a good time like one hour.
12:12:42 One hour five days of the week.
12:12:48 And do you, what time of the day works better for you or have you found that works better if you do something morning, in the afternoon and the evening, what has worked the best for you so far.
12:13:01 So far I've done like a mix to be honest I've done, depending on my work schedule sometimes it's like, I will get up in the mornings to just kind of knock out that workout in and then go to work right after.
12:13:15 But then on days that I can work from home. I'm a little bit more flexible so I wake up and I'll do a work, but then in the evening, in order to like kind of get off the house and get air out of working, I'll go in the evening.
12:13:30 And, yeah, so, but definitely like, morning and evening are going to are my go Tues.
12:13:43 Any other goal that you want to set for yourself, or do you think this one is a good one to keep, keep going for now.
12:13:53 Yeah, I really liked this one.
12:13:57 How confident, do you feel about being able to achieve it.
12:14:00 On a scale of one, not so confident and 10 very confident.
12:14:06 I think all in, like, 8.5.
12:14:11 Yeah.
12:14:13 Yeah. I always say anything, seven or above tells us that, yes, you've thought about it. And this is something that you want to keep going.
12:14:23 Yeah.
12:14:24 And you've, you've been working towards this throughout the last few weeks very consistently. And that's you mentioned, it sort of open your mind to exploring other ideas of other physical activity that you could do.
12:14:39 So I think it's a very good thing to keep going.
12:14:46 And he also has talked about ways to keep yourself motivated so using, like for example your watch, because it gives you like real life updates of how you're doing with your physical activity.
12:14:59 I think those are all good ways to also remember it is to stay on track
12:15:05 meet other successes that that you had that you want to share, or any challenges that you're facing that you want to maybe problem solve around.
12:15:17 No, honestly like, I think, saying, I think what's really helped me is like intentionally setting my goals beforehand, and not just being like, oh, I'll get to it when I get to it or like I'll figure it out in a little bit like talking about it.
12:15:34 Early on, kind of plants the seed in my, in my head, and then subconsciously on the planet and like, do this and do that and so once I think about it, early on.
12:15:45 It allows me to like my personality I think also helps achieving my goals because it's like once something's already like.
12:15:53 Once I say I'm going to do some damn 7% like has to do it, because it's like if I don't, then I just feel like shady at the end like, Oh, I didn't do that.
12:16:01 or like I didn't get to that and I cut up and, you know, especially if it's something that benefits me in the long run like my workouts and stuff like that and um, I don't know it's it's been really helpful and I think also like my personal trainers been
12:16:15 super helpful just because that's given me confidence to like feel stronger and I just do a new workout that I would never do on my own, but like now I am and, yeah, that's also another thing that's very good.
12:16:33 The other thing I would say is I mean this is only four weeks that we have with each other. And the goal of course is for you to gain sort of skills that can help you long term, right.
12:16:47 So I think you bring up a really good point about how important it is to intentionally set goals.
12:16:53 So in thinking about, you know, future goals that you set for yourself, or even just thinking about improving your health overall.
12:17:03 Whenever you find yourself in that situation or kind of wanting to refresh things up.
12:17:10 Use this again, the idea of goal setting is really helpful. And it's, it's also the reason why we focus so much on it every week because if we just break things down into smaller, more doable steps and tasks, it can really help us to, to reach like bigger
12:17:28 goals that that we have in mind.
12:17:31 It makes them more attainable, in a way.
12:17:34 Yeah, it does.
12:17:37 Yeah, so as you continue to grow in your, in your health course or your wellness. Just think of everything as, how can I set a goal around this, that can help me achieve like what I want at the end, which I know for you you had really wanted to work on
12:17:53 strengthening and being able to be stronger and Lyft, I remember you mentioned that you are trying to will box and it was like 25 pounds.
12:18:04 It was difficult. So just being able to figure out, well what are the steps I need to take before I can actually do that.
12:18:12 It's, it's important.
12:18:13 Yes. Yeah, I agree, I agree and I think yeah I think for me I was always into like long term goals you know and i think that works for me but I've also not have been able to practice short term goals which are so much, or spiel so much rewarding, like
12:18:31 I think long term goals be overwhelming but like short term goals.
12:18:44 Kind of like bring that instant gratification, which is something I always want and so it's just nice to like, learn something new about myself like okay yeah like you can also do short term goals.
12:18:46 Yeah, I know a lot of us just as human beings we want that instant gratification.
12:18:54 Yeah, yeah, definitely short term goals are the way to go for that. But knowing that those short term goals can add up to something bigger thing. And I think that's, that's very good to think.
12:19:08 So thank you, done very well.
12:19:12 Thank you. This has been a great time like talking to you it's so easy and comfortable. I really am so happy I decided to join this project.
12:19:25 It's been, it's been really exciting for us I guess as students, as well, to see something that we develop coming to real life. And, and see how I can impact, like individuals, other individual students I think that's been very rewarding for us.
12:19:42 And of course we cannot have this without you.
12:19:49 Otherwise, well I think that you set a great goal for yourself to continue to work with.
12:19:55 As with other weeks I'll send you a summary of the goal, and just so that you have that and as a reminder.
12:20:04 So in regards to next steps, you will be receiving a few more texts, I believe. I don't think you've received all of them yet.
12:20:14 But it should be ending. Probably around the end of this week. So there's a few more.
12:20:22 And please feel free to continue responding with your thoughts about them. It really helps us to figure out what messages we want to keep or how can we improve the messages for example you mentioned will maybe more more graphics more photos would actually
12:20:36 be more more helpful and that's that. That helps us.
12:20:41 And you're also going to receive a link or a follow up survey.
12:20:46 And you should get that before the end of today.
12:20:51 So the survey you'll notice is very similar to the one you took at the very beginning.
12:20:57 However, it's not as long
12:21:06 as I probably should only take you maybe 15 minutes or less. And then after you complete that survey, it is important that you do it right away, because then we can schedule, sort of like a little feedback interview.
12:21:18 Okay. And that will be done by another colleague of mine, because I am your health coach I cannot do the feedback because they want an unbiased opinion, ask you a few questions about your experience, once again, they'll ask you about your feedback on
12:21:34 how we can improve the program.
12:21:37 This meeting, typically is a little bit longer maybe 40 minutes to an hour.
12:21:46 And we have been trying to schedule it around the same time where the health coaches have met with the participants. So for example with you, we've been meeting on Wednesdays at noon.
12:21:58 Do you think that will be a good time for to set up that feedback interview.
12:22:04 Yeah, I think it's still will be a good time.
12:22:07 As long as like it's scheduled you know and I know, again, that way I might got a better space and and like more flexible and stuff like that but yeah it should still be a good time.
12:22:18 I mean so right now as it stands for thinking next Wednesday, which is, which I believe is me.
12:22:27 Yes.
12:22:30 Yeah, it looks like I could do that at 12pm. Okay, yeah. So let me just double check that someone is available to do the interview with you. And then as soon as you complete the survey.
12:22:45 Though the follow up survey will confirm the date and send you the link for that.
12:22:52 Okay yeah that sounds good because I want to stay consistent with like my schedule I don't want to miss it. So, yeah, yeah. So except and know that it might be a different zoom link because I'm not going to be the person running the meeting.
12:23:06 Just FYI, but it should invite the invite will still come from the excitement to send within Gmail. So, you should still be able to get that to get it.
12:23:16 Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.
12:23:19 And if you have any questions in the meantime, just let me know. And I still get your responses to text messages, and I still have access to the email where we have been corresponding so if anything comes up along the way, just feel free to to reach out.
12:23:36 Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Pleasure to meet you and I really. Likewise, I'm well sad but it's okay well I feel like we'll reconnect or crop, our possible cross somehow, some way.
12:23:50 I mean, I think. Alumni Association, or it gets large to.
12:23:55 Yeah, I was telling some of the students so I have your email, if I ever want to stop.
12:24:02 Good.
12:24:03 I think for the purpose of the study and until like at least their feedback interview is complete.
12:24:10 We're, we're doing our best to rate the, the personnel from the business yeah I totally understand it's part of your research and your program so yeah definitely you'll have our contact info so whenever you want to reach out, I'm here.
12:24:28 I mean, can I connect like that works for like three opportunities and stuff like that too so we'll chat will chat. Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank you for all the great pointers for the applications I remember we talked at some point about the
12:24:35 job searching and applying to different.
12:24:45 Thank you.
12:24:47 And then, yeah.
12:24:49 Need a raw, I will always keep an eye out here. You know, so where are you today physically located. So I am in the Mission District of the vaccination efforts right now.
12:25:05 Yeah.
12:25:06 Yes, and I've never I'm not placed in like vaccine sites but they are they the person that usually is in my spots on here today so they were like can you please come in because they do need like a lot of folks speak Spanish, in this district so of course
12:25:22 you know.
12:25:23 Yeah, we have to support we are we are the translators interpreters and everything. Yes, so I've just been here and then kind of like my personalities like I always kind of chat with everyone like.
12:25:34 Have you seen a therapist no I'm following that but like I'm just like, how's your house like almost fast like that like all these things and it's nice to communicate because some people talking to a stranger they can actually really bent like how they
12:25:48 actually feel versus talking to a family member who they kind of just want to look like they're okay to, you know, so it's nice.
12:25:55 Nikita and gala school was going with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but give us a few of them being different.
12:26:02 Yes.
12:26:04 Yes. But yeah, it was nice. I'm like, all of the goal setting and everything. Thank you so much I appreciate it and like I said, can reach out sometime.
12:26:18 have a good rest of your day. Bye. Bye.
