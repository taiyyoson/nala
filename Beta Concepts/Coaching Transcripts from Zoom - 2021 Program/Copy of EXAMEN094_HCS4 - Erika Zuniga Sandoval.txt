10:01:03 Know. I think I'm this morning.
10:01:05 Good. How about you, sir.
10:01:10 Let's say I have been keeping my room very dark Salisbury that it wasn't going to be bright enough that I grew up okay, because really warm now. So I have the lights off the curtains are closed
10:01:22 Trying to keep the room cool.
10:01:25 Okay, so let's, let's get started for today.
10:01:31 Today is our session for so it will be our last session for for the program.
10:01:37 Towards the end of today, I'll tell you a little bit more about next steps and sort of an follow up that is going to be happening.
10:01:46 But until we get to that point I want to know how was your week had to do with your goals of Ed practice and physical activity and I know you also wanted to spend some time outdoors.
10:02:00 So how did it all go for you.
10:02:03 It was pretty good.
10:02:06 I think I kept up with every one thing was I just wasn't as creative in terms of trying new things to eat.
10:02:15 But, um, my mom's really been cooking so I've just been eating whatever she's making and I think she put asparagus, in my pasta the other day and I thought that was delicious.
10:02:28 So that was one different thing that aid that include vegetables.
10:02:34 But yeah, in terms of getting out and doing exercise, it's definitely been a lot easier.
10:02:40 Now that the weather's nicer and I'm feeling more willing to be active.
10:02:46 Great. That's great to hear it yes the weather definitely changes the mood of it.
10:02:52 and then thinking about stress level this week.
10:03:04 How was your stress this this last week on a scale of one to 10.
10:03:04 I would say like a seven just because it is winding down in the semester and a lot of stuff. I have two presentations this week and a bunch of papers so comes with the territory.
10:03:17 Now, I know. Yeah, it's the end of the semester. Everything needs to get done, time,
10:03:25 and then thinking about today. So today, as I mentioned, is our session for.
10:03:30 I was still want us to think about water you.
10:03:34 What do you want to check in about today or what do you want to focus on. And think about your goals a little bit more long term like for example and 36 months, what do you want to be able to accomplish.
10:03:46 And we can still set up SMART goals that can help you to be able to achieve that.
10:03:53 So what are you hoping to get about today. What has been your thoughts.
10:04:00 I think for me it's just trying to maintain the consistency and wanting it to last forever and it's hard when I'm busy throughout the day but is trying to make an effort that's kind of my biggest thing is really trying to make an effort in, not, not be
10:04:20 content with doing nothing.
10:04:24 Yes, can be it can be easy to just not do anything.
10:04:30 But if they remember that it will affect the way to feel the way their body responds to things in our mode it is definitely affected a lot.
10:04:41 So hopefully getting outdoors and doing some of the activities that you will are doing, and have helped you be able to understand how that can also change the way that you feel and that in itself can motivate you to to stay consistent and wanting to,
10:04:58 to keep it up for a little longer.
10:05:02 So are there specific goals that you want to continue to be able to do Do you want to continue working on the previous calls that you had like the eating practice and the physical activity.
10:05:12 I know last week you also had getting outdoors.
10:05:16 So those, I mean those are really good ones I say to, to keep up.
10:05:22 Or is there something that you want to change up, were you thinking, I definitely want to keep up these goals.
10:05:29 Just because they're good goal to have.
10:05:33 But I think, I do want to add them up as the time goes I do want to like increase the frequency and how often are both, but I'm so yeah I really just focusing on those.
10:05:49 And I think for me it's, it's about building up my energy in the long term.
10:05:54 I feel like a very low energy throughout the day. So, and I have a new clinical training site with children on the spectrum. So that's going to require a lot of energy and I want to be able to give my all, in that training sites so I definitely like long
10:06:11 term wise I want to increase my energy level and in order to, you know, really utilize my day.
10:06:22 And I would say that the goals that you set for yourself can help you achieve that you feel you that you've seen that happen.
10:06:30 So hopefully picking up, keeping up with those words would be helpful.
10:06:36 Something
10:06:40 in terms of.
10:06:44 So, will war. What I'll do is I'll write the goals that you had last week, and that you'll continue with those for this week.
10:06:53 How confident, do you feel about being able to achieve, like the eating practice, and physical activity and also they getting outdoors.
10:07:01 I feel really confident, especially since the summer is coming so we'll definitely get outdoors more.
10:07:09 And I've been eating breakfast every day now I think it's like, now I'm just like I can't eat breakfast. So, um, yeah I really do feel confident that I keep it up.
10:07:21 On a scale of one to 10 Would you say that your.
10:07:25 Where, where would you qualify yourself for pilot can remind them to 10 by nine.
10:07:37 I always say anything above. Seven tells me that okay you've been invited and yes this is something that you will
10:07:45 usually work on it if it's anything knowledge and thinking about the progress that you've made over the last three, four weeks.
10:07:57 What would you say have been like your successes, or what are some of the MR with that, what have been some of the successes that you've had.
10:08:08 I think a major success is eating breakfast, well really eating every meal of the day now that hasn't that's been an issue for me and either forgetting or just not being in to go find something to eat.
10:08:21 So I've definitely been proud of myself for eating more consistently I've had weightless stomach problems.
10:08:29 And I think that's a good thing. And then,
10:08:34 I think, exercising too I think my shoulders, I can already see a difference because that's kind of an area of been focusing on because I really bad shoulders.
10:08:44 So I already see like a difference when I see my reflection, like if I have a T shirt on there, a lot more square and look not as like narrow.
10:08:54 So I'm just noticing the changes has definitely been a good thing.
10:09:03 And what are some of the, you mentioned this a little bit earlier with the energy level, but what are some of the challenges that you're still facing that maybe we could do some problem solving, so that when they come up, you're able to know okay this
10:09:18 is what I can do to overcome this.
10:09:22 I think myself is probably the biggest obstacle like I'm very willing to say, Oh, I don't want to do something I'm not going to do it.
10:09:31 And I need to really break that mentality and tell myself like this is a requirement, this is, this is a required assignment, you can't skip it.
10:09:40 Because I do like there'll be times where I'm just like yeah I really just don't feel like it, so I'm not going to. And then my partner will be like, no, get out there and go do at least 10 minutes and I'm like, all right, and then that will extend to
10:09:53 the full time so I'm like okay I'm already out here. So it's really just that initial step of just doing it.
10:10:04 To say that that that tends to be quite a challenge at times right, taking that first step.
10:10:13 You've been able to find ways to do it.
10:10:17 And it also sounds like you have support from others that can push it to do it.
10:10:22 So it's, it's very helpful to have support.
10:10:25 And I think that is something that it's something that can push us forward at times when we doubt ourselves or it might not even be the dab of when we prefer to just okay, I'm not going to do this right now, but if someone gives us that motivation or
10:10:42 that little extra push, then we might be more likely to do it.
10:10:56 And how would you continue to track your goals moving forward, or sort of hold yourself accountable for for your goals.
10:11:06 I think I mean I don't necessarily hold myself accountable, it's really just me thinking about like my partner, when I see him over the weekend he's like how often do you work out I'm like, so I know like I have to if I tell him alone over he's going
10:11:18 to be like, Wow, really, and I'm like, No. So it's just I think having somebody else hold me accountable is helpful, because I do make the excuse of like, well, I'm young, I'm healthy enough, you know I'm able to walk as far as I need to walk I'm able
10:11:39 to get up and go wherever I need to go, so do make the exclusive I am capable to do anything. I don't necessarily feel like I need to exercise but I am reminded you know, in the long term, I'm not going to always be able to do this and it's really about
10:12:00 the future, not necessarily about right now. Yes, I would say, I mean especially when we're thinking about in the realm of public health we think a lot about prevention and preventing future potential, the chronic conditions, or just the ability to be
10:12:17 able to do more as we get older is really important and critical. And just as you mentioned when we are at a certain age we think well we can do it on right now.
10:12:28 And just like you mentioned, is it may not always be that case right because eventually, if we are very lucky, we will get to an older age, and things are going to change our body will change.
10:12:39 So the more that we can stay active and have those, those habits that are going to help us to have a long and healthy life, the better.
10:12:51 And it really is about starting those lifestyle changes now, so that it's not so difficult later on in life.
10:12:59 Yeah, I think I definitely agree and I even like it's little things you don't start to notice until you're called out like I have a bad shoulder and I didn't realize I can't reach backwards with it.
10:13:13 Like I can go like that but I can't do that with this arm. And I was like, Oh, that's kind of an issue. If I can't necessarily just reach. Anyway, and it's kind of like okay well that's like the first thing to go right now is my shoulder and everything
10:13:28 else will start to follow. So if I let that go then everything else is going to go so the goal now is to really make sure that the shoulder isn't a problem, and that nothing else becomes a problem, like you said, Yes, and, and maybe, and I'm hoping that
10:13:44 the exercises that you're doing are helping you to regain more like range of motion.
10:13:53 For that, without shoes and shoulders are are my weakness to.
10:13:59 I'm going to tell you a funny story high side note, and I have like rotator cuff issues. And, yeah, and I get what is called a trophy shoulder, every so often, which to me is I have to walk around like this because it's so painful.
10:14:18 And I can move it, or I call it the shoulder.
10:14:27 I've had that a few times in the last, maybe three years, I get it at least once a year.
10:14:31 Last year actually did not. And I was surprised. That's really good.
10:14:37 Yeah, so we want to prevent those yeah yeah that's a wild I Yeah, mine is also the rotator cuff and they for me they called it stretchy tissue. So I have like, I'm prone to dislocations I dislocated my shoulder all the time.
10:14:55 And if I'm walking my dog, I have I cannot carry the leash on my left because he will pull the shoulder out. It's so it's like, apparently that's true for everywhere in the body, so it's like I really do have to, like, Yeah, this is that's an issue that
10:15:11 is like bad for the long term, short term I'm like oh it's like something little that I deal with but it's like no, that could be a big issue and so yeah you're right, definitely focusing on like the mobility stuff like getting the bands out, knocking
10:15:27 the dust off of them and doing those exercises.
10:15:31 Yeah.
10:15:40 Yeah, it is about, in the long term how we can keep those, those joints healthy.
10:15:40 Johnny joints now.
10:15:41 They keep us normally we gotta, we gotta keep them like oil kind of like car right on the edge of them for sure.
10:15:53 think.
10:15:54 So you have goals. We talked about successes that you've had.
10:16:13 I'm trying to think. Any other thoughts that you have for today's session I know it's our first our last question, any other topics that you want to bring up. Oh, I think, in terms of like getting the text messages.
10:16:17 They definitely make me want to expand my taste palette because like when I saw the spinach and strawberries, I was like, I hate both of those. I was just like wow I like, I don't give any food a chance and I'm just like, over it.
10:16:32 So I think for music, it really is getting me to want to try new things like whether or not I like strawberries, I want to go try some, like strawberry situation, and whether or not I like Spanish I want to try to incorporate that some way somehow because
10:16:48 how can so many people in this world, eat this food and I refuse to like it.
10:16:53 So I do want to, you know, expand my palate as much as I can.
10:16:59 Okay so, so quiet you mentioned actually just said I think I was checking to see what messages are you receive this week and I saw that one.
10:17:09 So it just made me think about it in a way that this is just an idea right oh spinach and strawberries, but maybe there's another fruit and another like leafy green that you enjoy.
10:17:20 But just, it's also meant to give you, like you said ideas of what other things you could try potentially sorry we didn't hit the mark with this penitence job.
10:17:32 That's okay, I think, for me it's like the strawberries have been like a childhood trauma situation and I think it's just about me moving past it and seeing is it really I don't like them.
10:17:43 or is it because I was traumatized with these things. So it's, it's very interesting to me I just don't know what happened what the strawberries, if you don't mind me asking.
10:17:55 I was, I don't even know if this is an accurate memory, because I was so so young, I was like, maybe five.
10:18:02 I was babysat by an older woman and I just remembered her being such a terrible lady and she had created a, like a strawberry snack for everybody and I was like oh I don't want strawberries I don't like them, and she forced them down my throat and I was
10:18:17 just like, I think. From there I never eat strawberries ever again I was like I'm over it.
10:18:24 So I think for me that has like unconsciously been the reason, and I've just stuck with the story of I don't eat strawberries.
10:18:33 And now I think it's like I, I mean I make chocolate dipped strawberries for my family all the time. Maybe I should eat one, and just give it a try.
10:18:42 I was asking, Well how about if they're covered in the back like really covered like a nice thick layer.
10:18:53 I mean, but sometimes those memories. And that's one of the wonderful things that I talk sometimes about with food foods bring up memories, whether there might be good, or whether they might not be so good right.
10:19:05 So how do we how do we still enjoy the foods that that are going to give us like good nutrition, like good values that we need to are like vitamins and minerals that we need to consume, but still have some of those like good memories that we want to have.
10:19:24 Or, yeah.
10:19:25 That's a tough one.
10:19:27 Interesting. Now I wish I did my dissertation on like food and emotions or food and memory.
10:19:33 I mean sometimes I'm looking, I'm eating something or this dentist and they will take me back to when I was a kid and having XYZ. Right.
10:19:45 Maybe we should have had the food and memory conversation.
10:19:53 How is the dissertation going.
10:19:56 That's going slowly but it's going.
10:20:02 Yeah.
10:20:02 Any other messages that stood out to you this week, or that was the main one. I think that one, just because it like I was just like, yeah, you're right, you and everybody else I need to eat more thing.
10:20:15 It's just these messages are always like speaking to things that I'm always like, Yes, you're right. I know I need to do that.
10:20:26 No, it's true.
10:20:27 And our hope is that as you're thinking about it then when we do our goal setting.
10:20:33 Then you can set goals around it so for example right now you're doing the directors, maybe just adding fruit or a vegetable to your practice.
10:20:44 And that's those are ways that we could add that on to
10:20:51 We covered everything.
10:21:04 That's good. So let me give you
10:20:57 just a few more details about what comes next. Because today's session for.
10:21:04 And as I mentioned you have set great goals for yourself for this last week, I'll send you an email with a summary of what those will be.
10:21:12 And then for next steps, you are going to continue getting a few more text messages. I believe your messages will, and maybe this Sunday or so.
10:21:24 After that, so please continue to respond to them if you have any thoughts on them, you will, by the end of today you will receive a link to do a follow up survey and think you should be able to get that today for the survey is similar to the one that
10:21:44 The survey is similar to the one that you did at the very beginning of the program. However, it should be a little bit shorter and it should not take more than 15 minutes.
10:21:53 After you complete the survey, you're going to be invited to meet with one of my examined colleagues, because they want to do like a follow up meeting to get your to hear more about your experience during the program to get your feedback on how to improve
10:22:11 the program.
10:22:12 This meeting is typically a little bit longer, maybe 40 to 60 minutes.
10:22:19 As of now, we've been trying to schedule them around the same time when you and I meet.
10:22:25 But I think I was asked because interviewers have a bit of a conflict with this time I think they wanted to know if you need on the 20th.
10:22:35 At this time at 10am.
10:22:39 Or we could do next Thursday, but it would have to be maybe 11, and later.
10:22:46 Okay.
10:22:51 I think I could do either time. My only thing is I have class at 1245. Oh wait, I don't think I'll have class, right because classes and after this week or next week, no after next week after next week.
10:23:02 So I'll, I'll be available.
10:23:05 So you could do next weekend in London. Next Thursday, you think the 13th or the 20th at 13. I'm just thinking maybe do it sooner rather than later so that it's fresh in your mind.
10:23:19 Okay, I do have an appointment on the 13th at 1115.
10:23:24 I don't know if you could do 10, or if the 20th would be okay. We can't do the 20th and I think that seems to be the best.
10:23:33 Okay, this date to keep the same time. Right.
10:23:40 At 10am, okay.
10:23:46 But 10 works. Yeah. Okay, so I will, so that I would also give you a little bit more time to complete the survey, because ideally you want to complete the survey, the follow up survey before your meeting.
10:24:03 I'm going to send on on the survey email output back a deadline for it, it won't be before the 20th. But just as soon as you get it then, the sooner the better because then you don't have to think about it today.
10:24:09 Yeah. Awesome.
10:24:14 So I'll send. So you will get the calendar invite until you complete the survey so that's something to keep in mind. So you'll get the survey complete that and then we'll add you to the calendar invite but I'll put a hole for that date and time for now
10:24:27 on our calendar and invite the person that can do the interview.
10:24:35 Any questions about them.
10:24:40 Well thank you so much for participating and excitement. It's been a pleasure working with you and this last four weeks.
10:24:47 You worked really hard to make lots of positive changes with your physical activity and eating breakfast every morning.
10:24:54 So remember that you are in control of certain things in your life, right. And it's important to just stay active moving to improve our health and just overall wellness as as we move forward.
10:25:06 I know it's also the end of the semester so having some time for yourself and hopefully these practices can can help you stay like centered and and clear that might have other stressors that are going on.
10:25:19 And hopefully it's helped you to gain some skills that you can continue to use moving forward in your journey to, to continue with your health and improving your wellness,
10:25:34 where all the dots I have any questions that you might have.
10:25:39 all the dots I have any questions that you might have. I really enjoyed this and being able to talk to you is really nice. So thank you.
10:25:48 Oh, I know I'm we're getting close to the end I have anyone else to talk to her why
10:25:54 it's been really good for at the beginning this intervention was not meant to be done during co it, but I think it actually worked out really well because it allow us to somehow stay in touch with others.
10:26:07 I didn't give us that up, you need to still stay connected.
