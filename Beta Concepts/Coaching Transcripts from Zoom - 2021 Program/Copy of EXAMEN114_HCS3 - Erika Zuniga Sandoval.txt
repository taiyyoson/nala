12:45:03 Hi. Sorry, I was just finishing my, my lunch
12:45:11 today.
12:45:14 But I was able to sleep in until 10 today even though that was not a good idea because I got back to work, but it just felt good to like take care of myself a little and just sleep until 10.
12:45:27 Yeah.
12:45:29 And how did it go last week with the goals that you had said.
12:45:34 I believe you want to go walking on your own for a bit. How did it go.
12:45:39 Yeah, so I did once on Saturday, which was actually really good because I went with some co workers to walk I think we have like not where I live, but like maybe five minutes they have like this long trail and we actually met up in the morning and I'm
12:45:56 not a morning person so I but I was totally just gonna flake.
12:46:00 But I actually got up and I went and we did about two miles. So that was like really out of my out of my schedule because I don't really like walking or running, But it just felt like I just felt like healthy.
12:46:16 And then that was like the only time that I was actually able to walk by myself.
12:46:21 So I think in that terms I know that I had said I think that I was going to, I think, three times throughout the week, but I ended up just doing like one, which was like a longer walk, because I think was like 3030 minutes.
12:46:39 But yeah, I think it was it's just been a very hectic week and then I know that I was going to keep my goal for the water and take some of that I've been keeping up.
12:46:51 I think just having my own place kind of helps because I'm like getting a water bottle every single like time. When I work from home and it just kind of helps versus like my parents house I would never get up and get a water so it's just kind of.
12:47:05 Yeah.
12:47:06 So in thinking about your goals, both the water and the walking on a scale of one to 10 How, how are you doing in meeting those goals.
12:47:19 I would say, you said the walking and the drinking water.
12:47:25 I would say an eight.
12:47:27 Okay. Yeah, cuz you've been able to do.
12:47:30 You just sort of had the modified time frame, right instead of three days you did a longer walk. Yeah.
12:47:44 When you were still able to walk which I know it's something that you wanted to start with. Yeah.
12:47:42 And in terms of your level of stress for this week. What would you say it's, it's sort of been at on a scale of one to 10.
12:47:54 I think this past week.
12:47:57 I would say like, He
12:48:01 also a lot of things going on.
12:48:03 Yeah, mostly like school. I have two more weeks left for spring session.
12:48:20 So it's kind of basically a final paper final presentation so I've kind of just been doing that and staying up super early, as I can with throughout the day because I work full time so that's been a little.
12:48:24 I've been a little tired.
12:48:26 Are you graduating this year to know, so I do.
12:48:32 I have summer so basically two more weeks for spring and then I have one week off, and then it's six weeks straight for summer sessions. And then I become a trainee so I can start doing my hours, that's for a whole year.
12:48:45 And then I graduate, so I don't have a year left.
12:48:49 Okay, and remind me which program are you doing at USF.
12:48:53 The marriage and family. Okay, yeah.
12:48:58 So nice to have a few more months to go, but it or almost actually a whole year you said right.
12:49:06 Yeah, but it's, um, you know next year is mostly just doing my traineeship.
12:49:13 We have one class, sorry, following one during the spring. So it's going to be very mellow like basically it's just getting my hours doing therapy individual therapy so it's going to be like better because I don't have to worry about school or homework.
12:49:29 So be nice, good. Yeah, it's more the practice. Yes. Good, good.
12:49:35 And what are you hoping to check in about today or what do you want to focus on this week.
12:49:43 I think this week like maybe managing my time a little better.
12:49:48 I think last time we talked about like self care a little bit I was like, This week I was like what do I want to work on. And I think like managing my time so that I have like time to do like everything because by like nighttime I get so stressed out,
12:50:04 that I feel like I have no like I haven't done anything even though I still work, they still did some school stuff like I still.
12:50:12 And then I start getting anxiety from like all these other things that I need to get done and so I think just like managing my time, along with eating healthier.
12:50:23 I think sometimes like now that I live by myself sometimes I'm like so tired so I just go in like make a quick sandwich. I'm not saying like a sandwich is super unhealthy but i i think my goal is to like on my parents I would cook more than I do here
12:50:39 so I think it's just the matter of, you know, making like a recipe and maybe a goal that I cook like two or three times like a week versus just popping something in the microwave or just kind of like to go so more help, so more healthy so I think those
12:50:59 two goals.
12:51:02 I was thinking about.
12:51:03 And when you're thinking of time management hectoring make that a little bit more specific.
12:51:10 What do you think of when you think of time management.
12:51:16 I'm, I'm guessing like having.
12:51:22 I think having a set time where I wake up, and then I do work, and then because I feel like throughout the day I'm all over the place like I'll do work and then sometimes I'll do school and I'll go like, back and forth, back and forth, I feel like I,
12:51:39 if I want to be super specific like actually waking up on time. And, you know, starting work at a certain time and then finishing by a certain time, so that you know I also have a set time for when I'm going to dedicate school time.
12:51:55 I just feel like I am all over the place, sometimes I don't really manage that part of it that well.
12:52:03 I don't know if that's like super specific Let me see.
12:52:14 We can we can work with that because when you say wake up by a certain time what time which one to wake up by,
12:52:15 I would say, like 730, because sometimes like I'll wake up, like 830, or even nine.
12:52:26 And even those like hour, hour and a half, or even two hours like it makes a huge difference in, you know, getting caught up with emails versus like if I wake up at nine 930, like, I'm already in and do I start getting stressed out and then I don't start
12:52:40 start my day, like, right. So, I think even just waking up at like 730 would be awesome.
12:52:48 Okay, So I cannot by 730.
12:52:52 How many days this upcoming week.
12:52:57 Um, I think I would do
12:53:01 like three days, I think three is like my number.
12:53:25 Do you have specific days of the week that you think this is most possible to do.
12:53:20 This week I would say definitely tomorrow, Wednesday. Yeah, so Wednesday. I would say Friday.
12:53:26 Thursday and Friday so I guess.
12:53:28 During the week is easier because the weekend is the only time that I can actually sleep in so I know that that won't be super possible.
12:53:36 Yeah, and I think that that work so let's say that. And I know that this is for the purpose of time management itself right.
12:53:47 And to give you more time in your day to do the things that you want to do. So the goal is to wake up by 730 for three days this week.
12:54:01 Think that's specific enough. Yeah, I think so too. Yeah, I was thinking I was like what what other days but I'm like oh there's only Saturday and Sunday as well there's also Monday because we see each other every Tuesday, too.
12:54:17 But it could be, you could leave it, I think three days is a very good amount of days to start with, especially if it's something new, right.
12:54:31 theme. How are you going to remember to do this. How are you going to hold yourself accountable for it. So I think like, typically my dogs wake me up around like seven to or like 637 to walk them until I come back and then I go to sleep so I have a routine
12:54:43 a routine like I'll go and then I come back and I'm like okay I'm gonna go to sleep like for one more hour and then I'll wake up, and then that hour maybe turns into like an hour and a half.
12:54:51 But I think that if I hold my self accountable like walking them. And as soon as I come back don't go to bed like just start work and like freedom and start work, just don't go to bed.
12:55:03 But I do that every, every morning and I think, just like my work that it's like so flexible, like sometimes I don't like it because I'm like oh man like I can go back to sleep and then wake up but then I'm, I'm behind so i think that i think that can
12:55:18 help like don't go to sleep. When I come back from walking my dogs and I have to do that every morning so.
12:55:31 Then there's already something that wakes you up early in the morning and that can help. Good. And how confident, do you feel about being able to achieve this goal.
12:55:35 Like, if I had to do scale one to 10 I like probably 10.
12:55:44 So do you also talked about healthy eating.
12:56:08 Let's work. Let's make something a little bit more specific around that. So I heard a few things I heard you want to eat healthier you want to cook more meals.
12:56:04 What do you think would be a good one to start with, or a good start for you this week.
12:56:11 I think making a grocery list, um, yeah I think making a grocery would be like my first step.
12:56:18 Because I've kind of been like liking it, even though I thought I was going to be really good at it like well I'm going to move on and do a grocery list but I think actually making a grocery list.
12:56:28 And then, if I am super specific like maybe finding two to three recipes that I can make this week.
12:56:40 I think that would also be like helpful to know like okay I'm going to make this and I'm going to like write down like what I don't have, and then actually like going to the store either today or tomorrow to actually buy them.
12:56:55 Okay. Yeah, yeah, I get.
12:56:57 I think sometimes we we think of what we want to do, but we gotta take a few steps back just like you're describing think of when I first I need to start with making a list of my groceries.
12:57:18 So when is, when is it time that you could spend doing this and for how long do you want to. How long do you want to take to create this list.
12:57:22 I think today if I had to be super specific like five, because I know that I'll be hopefully done by like doing my work so like if I'm super specific like by five I could say by 5pm, because if I have a break in between I can definitely do it but I guess
12:57:39 by 5pm today have that list done, and then go to the grocery store, tomorrow like after work and actually go in tomorrow and the Office of I'm super specific like I know that I'll you know there's a grocery store just down the street where I live.
12:57:55 So I can go to the grocery store, right after.
12:57:58 Yeah.
12:58:05 And how confident, do you feel about being able to make that grocery list right today at five.
12:58:12 Um, I would say like, when eight, because there might be a chance that I forget, but I'm going to mine myself to remember.
12:58:23 I was that was gonna be my next question. How can you remind yourself to do this by the end of today.
12:58:28 Um, yeah I was, I can put in my calendar, because I usually throughout the day like if I have any meetings or anything going on like I can just put that home there
12:58:40 were perfect.
12:58:43 You also mentioned the creating the two to three recipes for this week. Did you want to add that or do you want to just stick with the first two.
12:58:56 I think it's not, I think for me, I can definitely add that because I know like certain recipes that I can make that I haven't made in a while then I'm like oh I know that would be like a nice meal to have this week, so that I can always, I think that
12:59:10 will also help me make a grocery list.
12:59:14 Like, looking at what I have here my house, and then looking at what I need to buy still.
12:59:21 So when you thinking about the recipes themselves you're mentioning that there's some recipes you already know or can use.
12:59:31 So is there. I guess I'm trying to figure out how to make that the goal itself more specific in terms of. Are you going to spend like 20 minutes looking up recipes, or thinking of the recipe.
12:59:47 Yeah, um, I would say probably, I think 20 minutes is a good time frame to think about it or sometimes like I even just look up some videos.
12:59:59 I'm not the type of person to look up like on Google. I'm more like, I want to see videos so I usually look them up on YouTube, of like, some recipes.
13:00:10 So, like spending 20 minutes, I think I have one already in top of my head so I guess I would just look up another one.
13:00:18 I was mentioning this yesterday, my boy afraid of language what I wanted to make so that's like one recipe. So I need to just come up with one more recipes so just taking those 20 minutes to look up.
13:00:31 And do you foresee that this is something that is I'll just take you one day of the week to do or will it take you multiple days during the week to do this.
13:00:38 I think one.
13:00:40 I guess if you count like actually going to buy the groceries, it would be too, because sometimes I might not go the same day. Yeah, well maybe like one to two if we include like going to buy the groceries, as well.
13:00:56 So what I, what I did is I sort of separated the recipe both from the making a grocery list that way it's two separate activities that you're going to be working on I mean there at the end of the day they serve the same purpose which is that you want
13:01:10 to be able to make your own food at home, rather than we just do doing frozen food for example from the microwave
13:01:23 thing.
13:01:25 Yeah.
13:01:26 And how confident, do you feel about being here.
13:01:29 I find 20 minutes that you can, where you can do that research or look up wanted to recipes.
13:01:36 I would also say an eight.
13:01:45 I think that's a good amount to for this week, I wouldn't recommend focusing on on more than those three things, just so that you have plenty of time to do each and process, single.
13:02:02 Yeah. In terms of the messages that you receive this week, were there any text messages that stood out to you that you thought, Oh, this is really motivating me to want to do something different.
13:02:15 Yeah, it was. I typically have my phone, but I really liked the, the picture.
13:02:24 I'm
13:02:25 trying to remember which one it was.
13:02:28 Can I get my phone real quick.
13:02:43 To the one I got this morning I like that one in that actually made me think like of the fruit, I woke up I told my boyfriend I was like I want some fruit.
13:02:50 But anyways, it was this one. Oh, it wasn't one on Saturday so it was actually right before my run.
13:02:56 It said do something fun while dancing shopping call a friend do whatever you enjoy as long as it's healthy. So I really liked that one because I was literally like five minutes away from actually starting to run.
13:03:08 So it kind of made me think like, Oh, this is actually fun and towards the end I thought I was dreading waking up, and then in the whole morning I was like in a bad mood like why did I sign up to like you know why.
13:03:22 after I was finished, I just felt like more healthy and just relax and I'm like oh like this is actually not bad and I got my exercise in, and I was able to chat with my co workers around me so it was like, you know, which is nice.
13:03:39 So I really like that one that one.
13:03:43 You know, because it asked a question like feeling stress question mark and then with the picture. So I'm like I am feeling stress because I don't like reading but, you know, it was actually turned out to be awesome so I really like that one.
13:03:55 And then I also like the one where it said Spring is coming take a break from the computer and TV. Get outside smell the flowers walk fast and get ready for the new season.
13:04:07 I think that's just like a good reminder, because I was actually in the office all day yesterday, and it was just kind of like overwhelming and I'm like, but then it was nice to think like I rather be working then be at home watching TV, because I think,
13:04:22 like, when I don't have anything to do like at night I can watch TV and like watch and just like binge watch. And then, you know that doesn't make me feel productive so I like that one and then I would really like the one today so I think all I really
13:04:35 liked all of them, but I think if I had to pick one it would be the one on Saturday.
13:04:40 Sorry, that was like longer than usual.
13:04:45 The one today you mentioned was the one with the fruit. Yeah, that one I was like that looks so good.
13:04:52 And yeah I agree, especially because summer is getting closer to summer the weather is warmer. So yeah, yeah, yeah they actually have one.
13:05:03 Just like little stand like maybe 10 minutes away from a house with they actually sell these. So like oh that sounds so good.
13:05:12 Yeah, that's, that's good, it's accessible.
13:05:20 Awesome.
13:05:20 Any other questions that you might have.
13:05:25 Think I think that's it. We have a good amount of goals for the week.
13:05:30 And last time I'll send you a little summary of the goals, and I usually do that via email. So let me know if if you're able to see them see them sometimes I add links or just some tips or things that you might find helpful.
13:05:48 I'm not sure if I've added the one about seasonal photos, because that might help you with your grocery shopping list.
13:05:57 Okay. No, I don't think I have I think the other last week he only send me I think the meditation. Okay, so let me put the one about seasonal produce because that can help you to maybe think of some of the fruits and vegetables that you want to do for
13:06:14 your for your grocery shopping list. Okay, Awesome. Thank you.
13:06:20 Okay. Yeah, thank you.
13:06:23 If anything else comes back during the week, just feel free to text and respond to the email, either. Either one works. Okay, awesome, thank you so much Erica, and we will be seeing each other next thing
13:06:43 at, well, do we need to change the time to a little later again. What are you thinking. No, I think next week. You said 12.
13:06:52 I have it on that 12. Yeah, 12 works for me.
13:06:58 And it will be our last session. So, I'm ready to still make a goal that you want to work on because we can still do that.
13:07:08 And then I'll give you more details about sort of next steps after we're done with our sessions because there's of course survey follow up. Okay, perfect.
