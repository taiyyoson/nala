11:00:21 Okay. Hello. How are you, good how's it going today, tired, but good
11:00:29 long week.
11:00:31 It's been a long week I think I've had some difficult nights in a row, and it's impacting yeah I don't can't talk right and what do they call I said like sleep deprivation.
11:00:46 Yeah, yeah, that a little bit. Yeah. How are you.
11:00:54 Yeah. Good good it's, I'm excited that is Thursday Tomorrow is Friday, I know.
11:00:58 Yeah, I'm off from work this morning and tomorrow morning. Oh, yeah. So I'm excited that I get some time to just focus on my project and the winning score work that needs to get done, but
11:01:17 that's really.
11:01:18 Are you here to check in about you.
11:01:24 We can do that for, like, please.
11:01:26 So how was your goal that last week, how did you do really well. I'm, I'm, I actually overdid it, meaning that it was 20 minutes minimum. And then on a couple of oak, I think, to wise in the past week, I was able to do more.
11:01:53 I'm just because you know, I felt like it. Um, but I think that the strategy to have a plan in the morning and then kids didn't happen you know have a plan B in the afternoon, worked really well really really well because before.
11:02:12 The challenge was, I was heading for all I can do it today, I'll do it later and that later never happened.
11:02:19 And now if it doesn't happen organically in the morning.
11:02:24 We have another chance. I do.
11:02:28 And it's worked really well. So I am very happy.
11:02:32 Good. I'm good.
11:02:33 So we'll just say, a scale of one to 10, how are you doing man meeting your, your goal. go 10, like
11:02:44 you mentioned that you've had some difficult nights. Do you think they're associated with stress, and if so, like, what has been your stress level this week or is it something else.
11:02:57 It could be stress, um, but
11:03:04 I do so many things throughout throughout my day to make sure that I keep you know myself balanced and grounded.
11:03:14 But I'm sure that, you know, a month from graduation, that has a certain impact. However, it was related to my diabetes.
11:03:29 I had a night where I had a hypoglycemia at one, and usually I fix it you know I wake up, fix it was some sugar, wait an hour, because that's what I need to do in order to make sure that it's going in the right direction.
11:03:54 Um, and after an hour it was only 230 to 30, I was at a right level to go back to bed and sleep, but for some reason my body was still feeling when I have symptoms, physical symptoms when I have a low.
11:04:06 And this physical symptoms. We're not leaving without going your way, which is very odd. After an hour for me to be at the right range and still feel not good.
11:04:18 So, that kept me up all night.
11:04:23 And I think I over caffeinated. The next day,
11:04:30 and I couldn't fall asleep until one.
11:04:33 So, yeah, that has been kinda, it could be stressed, but I think it was more health than anything else.
11:04:41 And why would you say was your stress level this last week on a scale of one to 10.
11:04:53 Seven because I had last week, life took over. And I wasn't able to achieve all the goals that I had set up for that week.
11:05:02 which means that I'm working on getting back on track, which usually gets you know takes time for me to get back on track.
11:05:11 Just because I feel behind. And so that's creating stress. So I would say that I did my best to, you know, keep myself grounded but I was, yeah stress was there so seven.
11:05:24 Yeah, yeah. So you're feeling that you're sort of having to play catch up at this point, with some of the things that you want to do, last week. Yeah.
11:05:33 And what else are you hoping to be able to check in about today, or what do you want to focus on for this week. I was thinking about that. I'm definitely continuing with the meditation because that has helped by the way, I'm tremendously.
11:05:50 And, you know, giving myself like okay I can do it I can, you know, stay on track and all these things.
11:05:57 But I've been thinking about.
11:05:59 If I want to focus on food.
11:06:03 Or, as we discussed last time, though I do this. If I wanted to go, you know, focus on more plant based meals.
11:06:13 As I did have that as the note that you wanted to consider food for the next one.
11:06:21 I think I had mentioned.
11:06:25 You wanted to start. I sent you something to start thinking about the types of fruits and vegetables that you might want to include for your next goal.
11:06:32 Yeah, we could do something around that or if you have something else in mind it's whatever you decide to do.
11:06:37 Right, right. And the thing is I've been so tired.
11:06:42 In the past couple of days and I'm wondering if last 10 minutes of my thinking.
11:06:51 Um, I thought about why not create a new strategy around sleep, to make sure that I get quality sleep.
11:07:03 I feel like it's out of my control.
11:07:07 I wanted to ask you about that because I know you mentioned that the reason why you weren't able to, to see force because of the symptoms of hypoglycemia.
11:07:28 What are some things that maybe can help you to ensure that that hypoglycemia doesn't happen so that then you're able to get a good night's sleep. That's what I'm about, no yeah no it's a great it's a great question and I, I, I eat early enough in the
11:07:38 so that by the time that I go to bed. I don't have any acting rapid insulin in my system, which, that is most likely 90%. The reason why I experience, hypoglycemia when I'm sleeping.
11:07:54 I'm.
11:07:54 Another reason could be.
11:07:56 I didn't have enough of a big meal at dinner because I wasn't hungry.
11:08:02 And my long acting insulin kicks in Kingston continues to work because it works 24 hours, and that's the second reason why I may have a hypoglycemia like I cannot run too long without enough sugars in my system.
11:08:20 So it's the balance between the two. And, you know, I've had this for five years and.
11:08:26 Oh my goodness. I've played trial and error.
11:08:30 And I still, you know once in a while have the hypo at night, and that feels very much, outside of my control.
11:08:39 Because you know like it's like first.
11:08:42 The first strategy is have the dinner at the same time every night which I do.
11:08:48 Another strategy is have the same meal, you know, the same combination, so I play with the same meal it's like protein, carbs, you know, vegetables, It's looks like there's are very boring, they look all the same.
11:09:00 I mean, you know, in terms of micros.
11:09:04 They're exciting because I cook so,
11:09:08 um, and then the last thing is you know check your sugars, before going to bed.
11:09:14 Two hours before going to bed and before, right before, you know, turning the lights off.
11:09:20 And if I made the right level there's nothing I need to do. I sometimes have the intuition to have an extra sugar piece of sugar, before going to bed.
11:09:30 If I know that my meal was too small.
11:09:34 But sometimes, everything is, you know, sort of say, you know, normal, and I still do that so I think the strategy is there.
11:09:54 Um,
11:09:47 so, and in terms of going back and thinking about improving or working on this thing because I know that's what you brought up earlier, how do I develop a better like sleeping regime.
11:09:59 What do you think would help you, given the situation with the hypoglycemia and that that may or may not happen. Yeah, that's a great question. Um, so, besides that, you know, outside of that what I meant with better sleeping schedule.
11:10:17 I read about this term not too long ago and I thought it was very very good and really embodied what I sometimes do.
11:10:25 It's called sleep revenge.
11:10:28 Oh, I have not heard of that. Yeah, it's really cool it's really cool. It's really cool because we, I think a lot of sleep revenge is when you know you had a very long day, and there was lots to do lots of work and studying and calls and zooms and errands
11:10:48 and groceries and you've been running the entire day, non stop, and you want some neat.
11:10:55 And you get up to dinner, you're like, Okay, I don't care. I'm going to watch something on Netflix right, but instead of, you know, keeping it and saying at 10pm Okay, done, I've done my half an hour of Netflix thing and going to bed.
11:11:14 You're like, no, I had a crappy day or had a really long day, and I really
11:11:21 want to take revenge. Right. I'm on this day and have this, you know, full three hours of binge watching. So that's sleep revenge.
11:11:33 Wow. Yeah, when you're taking it you know you're taking your from your hours of sleep, to make cup.
11:11:44 You had running your own like a cuckoo.
11:11:48 And, and what exactly do you have in mind to do for for your plan that might include them.
11:11:55 I was wondering if I'm
11:12:02 finding different. And how do you say,
11:12:07 new ways to unwind at the end of the day, that don't include watching Netflix has you know has this awful thing where they goes on to the next thing.
11:12:24 You know it has this awful thing where they goes on to the next thing. So unless you stop it, it just continues. Yeah, it's that's how they gay so that they get you.
11:12:32 And I'm wondering if I could find something that would, you know,
11:12:39 is there a way to turn that up.
11:12:43 I don't know, good question.
11:12:47 I don't know, cuz I'm assuming it's a setting right that you can. I don't know no check, I need to check. Yeah, I never thought about it. I will tell you that.
11:13:00 Personally, I don't have Netflix, for that same reason. And I applaud you. I tend to just watch watch watch and sit on the couch and not do anything else.
11:13:13 My sister has an account My brother has an account but they will purse, like on purpose will not share their account with me because they know me.
11:13:24 Okay.
11:13:27 I will admit to that account. Yeah. And, and they told me, we would share with you, but we know you need you to be productive.
11:13:39 Yeah, nice, clean and safe.
11:13:48 No, it's so easy to turn it on, you know. And, yeah, it's it's.
11:13:51 I do need to what I do get from Netflix, by the way, I do get something positive. Right. I get, which I could get so many other ways, but I get the disconnect.
11:14:01 So I want to focus on. How can I disconnect without, you know, like, while being mindful.
11:14:12 What would you suggest would be a good like routine i mean i think that i think watching something is completely fine and but I do get the sense that you want to make sure that you're also setting a specific time for it.
11:14:27 And that you stick to that.
11:14:29 So I think it should be find, I don't see why that's not okay. And that's a good way to disconnect and not think about anything else your mind is distracted.
11:14:41 Because I mean you're already doing meditation and I feel is a different type of disconnecting. Yes, and you're looking for something that's a little bit different to help you just relax and not worry about everything else that's been going on during
11:14:54 the day, exactly because I I love reading.
11:15:00 I love reading, and the experience of reading before going to bed is always disappointing. I never remember what I read them but like I don't go.
11:15:16 It's my mind is like I'm so tired by the time I get to the book that it's not fulfilling it's not in fulfilling experience because I'm still stuck in my head, not really paying attention to what I'm reading.
11:15:24 Um, so I tried that. So you're saying, I could continue doing the Netflix, same thing, or watching some TV. But, setting a time.
11:15:36 Yes.
11:15:37 Okay, like we do for meditation your meditate for 20 minutes for example, you did that before. So thinking of yes I'll watch. If there's like a specific show that you want to watch.
11:15:49 I would say look at how long the episodes art and like tell yourself, I will watch like one episode. But I mean, it's going to require willpower, right stick to that time frame and I would say also look into the idea of, see if there is a way to turn
11:16:03 out. I'm checking that out Yes, I see.
11:16:17 Yeah,
11:16:17 I agree, I agree. The thing is,
11:16:23 yeah I to see what I'm watching and see what an episode is because yesterday, for example, it was already midnight by the time I was only one episode that was, that was my mindset.
11:16:37 Um, but I wasn't feeling tired. That's also the other thing right, I wasn't feeling tired. By the time the episode ended, which is why that was not tired, I might as well just,
11:16:50 just watch another one.
11:16:54 Yeah, that's not a good idea.
11:16:58 And we're just back i love it i just love watching your face and realizing that it's not
11:17:10 very real I keep it real. Yeah.
11:17:14 Okay.
11:17:16 Do you have.
11:17:18 Do you have something in mind that you can just watch for one episode or it's something that you need to still kind of locked into.
11:17:35 No, I need to look into it, I tried something new that wasn't at all, because the thing is also. I'm to find the show. And I'm looking for a show or documentary something that I'm not depressed at the end.
11:17:42 I'm sorry but documentaries on climate and environment.
11:17:52 So I keep those documentaries for the weekend and the afternoon, so that I can you know do something else afterwards.
11:18:00 I'm looking for something that is uplifting, you know, not too sad I don't want to go to bed and feel sad about what I watched. I don't watch the news for example at night.
11:18:10 I don't watch horror things or anything so I'm looking for something that could just do that you know disconnect for half an hour will be great.
11:18:18 Maybe just even if it's a comedy something that that will make you laugh. Yeah, exactly.
11:18:25 And how many nights, do you want to do this or how many days of the week do you want to do this.
11:18:54 Good question.
11:18:46 Good question because I don't always turn it on, I just turned it on on you know again have a long day, I really that that's my that's my go to, um, how, how often do you have long days during the week is it like once a week thing twice a week.
11:19:12 Oh, long days.
11:19:07 I feel like half of the week are long days and the other half are, you know, more, more balanced, particularly lately, where, you know, it's the end of the semester and I'm doing this TA.
11:19:22 So that's, and the thesis, and the extra class that I have on sustainability and looking for jobs. These things lately I've had more long days I think that's what's been going on, huh.
11:19:36 Yeah. If you had to choose and amount of days to do it for this week. How many days do you think would be feasible. I think for, I think, for
11:20:06 Do you know the length of time that you want to spend, I would, I would want ideally less than an hour
11:20:06 also allows me to
11:20:09 be in bed, and check you know what's the direction of my, my glucose.
11:20:17 Yeah, yeah, basically, and how confident, do you feel about being able to do this goal for this upcoming week.
11:20:28 Um, I never tried it. Um,
11:20:34 So I think
11:20:38 that it makes sense, it's like a goal that makes sense. So, I will want to make my best. I try and get the link is the part where, you know, I know I'll get tempted to do more than an hour.
11:20:51 I think it's six over 10.
11:20:55 Okay. And, and, do you think the man of time is what is making it a six confidence level of six, or how fun to be sick confidence level of you being invited to it.
11:21:08 Um, well I don't want to do more than an hour, but you know at the end of the day, your brain is not really the thing that is the most like the willpower is no longer there.
11:21:18 I didn't know the day feels like anything that is, you know, like the temptation gets bigger,
11:21:24 to like, it's fine I'll just do my.
11:21:28 That's a good question.
11:21:34 I think I'm going to trip on the one hour.
11:21:40 But also, I like the challenge. So,
11:21:48 I want to make sure that you succeed so that's sort of where my question comes when it comes to the confidence level that you're telling me that your confidence level is six which tells me you're, you're thinking about it there's something that makes
11:22:01 you unsure, because you foresee that something might get in the way of doing it.
11:22:07 It's the time, it's the less than an hour time, because sometimes an episode is, you know, 40 minutes, and if I do get tempted to why the second one, I already failed at to go live an hour.
11:22:22 And I know that if it's, these are like episodes, I do have the tendency.
11:22:31 Um, I do have the tendency to watch to do things and I do most things in twos or threes not episodes but, you know, episodes are usually two.
11:22:43 So if it's over 30 minutes, I know that I'll be above the hour.
11:22:52 Do you want to extend the amount of time to an hour and a half to give yourself wiggle room. That way if you do want to watch a second one you can but if you don't have to then you don't have to.
11:23:06 I like that I like that. Yeah, I like that.
11:23:11 So we'll do arrange to an hour to
11:23:17 cool. Yeah.
11:23:24 Confident would you feel about being well no eight.
11:23:28 Yeah.
11:23:32 Anything else that you want to work on for this week or that's the main thing that you're just trying to unwind and mentally. Just turn off your brain, particularly because of the last week how the last week went and how you know I'm forcing the next
11:23:47 week's coming. I think I like this or like this goal being in place so that I can
11:23:56 feel like I'm, you know, into the decision seat, instead of, you know, did you want to do anything around what we discussed last week for the fruits and vegetables or do you want to leave that for next week.
11:24:12 I think I'll leave it for next week because I'm still playing with my I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, by the way, thanks to the messengers, and I'm trying to figure out a better way to account for them during throughout the day.
11:24:28 But yeah, yeah, next week.
11:24:32 Okay, let me. You mentioned the messages so let me ask you a little bit more about those which stood out to you this last week.
11:24:47 My brain is not working, so wait a second.
11:24:49 I'll tell you right away.
11:24:52 I have one in mind.
11:25:00 Oh, yeah, I remember.
11:25:05 It's the one
11:25:12 I read it and I was already feeling overwhelmed with my day. And it's the one that comes with.
11:25:24 What can I do to promote social justice and peace in the world. And it comes with like four other bubbles that text message to me was overwhelming but I laughed at myself as I realized that I was overwhelmed by the message because there was a beautiful
11:25:34 message.
11:25:36 But then it was like, Oh, what am I going to do to promote that.
11:25:43 And it was doing like the whole like Jewish guilt trip, or like, Am I doing enough.
11:25:49 So that would be me laugh because of my sense of humor and like how I react sometimes very dramatically i'd good things, and I, if that makes sense. So that wants to me I don't know how I didn't remember, but that one was the one that stood out to me.
11:26:04 Just because like how it was engaging the questions were great.
11:26:08 I opened it it was already like cramming in the to do list.
11:26:15 And it was just thinking, am I promoting anything, and a bit of an existential crisis.
11:26:24 I can see them happening. I can see that.
11:26:28 That man, the message has a lot a lot in it.
11:26:34 I'm glad that that it made you laugh though.
11:26:38 Yes, yeah.
11:26:41 No no no no no no oh my goodness. The thing is I think I've started asking myself existential questions since I was eight. So there's a point where you just like notice that, you know, like the habit.
11:26:56 Yeah. So, any other messages that stood out to you this week.
11:27:02 I was honestly that was the funny one.
11:27:10 To me,
11:27:10 I think that was the one that really stood out to me because of the the the reaction.
11:27:20 Yeah.
11:27:35 I think that would be the number one, and then I love receiving you know good messages around food. I've had such a difficult relationship with food, difficult because of diabetes, you know, diabetes makes everything complicated, so I was she was food
11:27:36 has you know evolved and changed, and I love seeing positive messages around, you know, food, like, instead of the, you know, things that you found Instagram for example, don't consume this don't consume that all these things.
11:27:50 I love being reinforced like the good thing so for divisible and really good for you. So I always enjoy receiving those. Yeah.
11:27:58 Thank you. Yeah, I think that's that was definitely. Our goal with the approach of not telling people what not to do, but giving them options of what is, what can be done separately for particularly with like my, my journey with food.
11:28:14 I, I'm, I'm very pro the the positive movement around reinforcing good things. So I really like them. Oh, thank you, thank you.
11:28:26 And the Any other questions any other thoughts go.
11:28:39 And we'll check in about how you did with your goal for this week. I will send you a reminder just like I did last time through email with a little summary, and I'm trying to think if there's any resources but I don't think in terms of resources there's
11:28:54 anything additional to add today, nor the email.
11:29:00 Unless I have suggested some shows that you can watch but I don't watch Netflix myself so that will be.
11:29:08 I would have to ask people
11:29:13 I would have to ask people, so I could give you some guidance around that. But let me ask because we're part of a team I can just text them like Hey, is anyone watching anything funny or entertaining on Netflix.
11:29:25 I'll let you
11:29:28 seem.
11:29:30 Those are all my questions for you today. Thank you. And I'm glad that last week went well, for your action, money, or for your goal.
11:29:40 I'm hoping that this week you have better sleep and things are okay with the glucose and
11:29:56 I was gonna ask you, how often does it happen during the week, and do you have to check in with your provider about it when I have a good good really good question. So, it doesn't happen, it used it.
11:30:01 It happens when I do dramatic change in lifestyle.
11:30:06 It goes both directions. Right.
11:30:13 And
11:30:12 right now, I would say that the last hi boy had before the one I experienced this week was more than a month ago, so that's very good. That's very very good news.
11:30:25 They used to happen more often more frequently.
11:30:28 Because I tried so many different things.
11:30:32 But now I have been on a good you know for them, and following it's very similar structure, so that they don't happen often.
11:30:40 Okay. Yeah, but they do, because, you know, I'm just wondering if it's something you need to check in with your provider about maybe because I remember you mentioned the long lasting insulin, like, does that need to be adjusted like any, any Thank you,
11:30:59 thank you. I actually, I had to adjust it. And my because I was going through a lot of hyper which is the other side of the thing.
11:31:11 And I had to adjust it in order to correct that so that has been corrected.
11:31:24 I'm a little bit of a perfectionist so if I don't see that, you know, throughout the day I tend to take more insulin.
11:31:28 In order to make sure that I stay in range.
11:31:32 And that's exactly, exactly. Yeah, thank you thank you thank you for checking in. Yeah, yeah, yeah skipping meals is this matter. A good thing on you know, Not even skipping meals sometimes is you know you plan that you would have dinner ready by seven
11:31:50 and it's ready by eight, and that extra hour just.
11:31:56 Yeah, it's the way our body works I mean specifically for you because of the way that insulin works in your body.
11:32:03 It's an external. Yeah.
11:32:08 Boys I want to say but a solution that you have to put in your body and then it takes time to process. And then if it's not, if you don't have food by a certain time then now you have it in your bloodstream, doing its thing.
11:32:24 Yeah, exactly.
11:32:25 Yeah, you got this is I mean, if it's something that happens rarely, and you have a pretty good handle of it and I think you.
11:32:42 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
11:32:41 Take care. Have a good night.
11:32:44 Good weekend.
