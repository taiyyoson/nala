18:46:03 Yep.
18:46:04 Okay.
18:46:05 We might have some like reflection about like what you can do for the future that maybe could help you meet your goals later. But like, let it go.
18:46:17 I don't sound good. Yeah.
18:46:21 So it sounds like you did have a pretty intensely you want something about your stress level.
18:46:29 Um, yeah, I was like, out of 10 I just have like a lot of fourth deadlines.
18:46:41 And
18:46:41 I like to climb from the study abroad program I was going to apply to.
18:46:47 I don't know if I told you but the deadline was like, April 12, and I never saw the email because my dog had died a couple of days before and like more and trying to be with her and then after I just like couldn't do any work.
18:47:17 And so I emailed them not and they were like worse Are you like. It's too late.
18:47:09 No. Bi kinda like I've been bummed about that and then Monday, I like had zero motivation, like what's I really I couldn't.
18:47:17 I went to all my classes that I couldn't be on camera.
18:47:24 And then this past weekend was actually pretty good.
18:47:28 I didn't really do anything at all I just had.
18:47:31 I spend time with my family so I was like, Why the best part.
18:47:36 You went to like the park and you want to eat dinner and like ice cream so I was nice.
18:47:42 But yeah like last week it was just like a lot of deadlines and then Thursday I had, like, a full day for me to like 8pm.
18:47:56 So I learned a lot and then Friday I attach and maintain the geology class and like also put a lot of my energy.
18:48:08 And yeah, but I didn't talk like a walk coming up with Finally, boy.
18:48:14 Yeah.
18:48:19 So, I think I remember one of your goals from last week was around like doing something for yourself like getting boba.
18:48:30 Do you think that like going out with your family was a form of self care.
18:48:40 Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, because we went out and then we got gelato. I think I told him, tomato and occasionally and like that was really good.
18:48:50 Like in replacement for those kids it's expensive.
18:48:56 Yeah. How do you feel about making that connection between like making one of your meeting one of your health goals with your family.
18:49:06 And it was nice, especially because before the kind of make like we were like cats and dogs.
18:49:14 But I feel like we've gotten a lot more close and we found it on what.
18:49:20 Yeah.
18:49:22 Okay.
18:49:24 Cool.
18:49:28 So,
18:49:31 sorry. Um, let me ask you this, like if we do say like you met one of your health goals by going out with your family. On a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did overall and meeting your health goals.
18:49:45 I mean, I didn't work out all those I just couldn't get my body to move.
18:49:53 But I think I'm nine because the family part like really played like a really balanced out my scale.
18:50:05 For sure.
18:50:07 So you would say, Did you say a five or nine, and nine sorry I didn't really cut off.
18:50:14 Okay.
18:50:16 Alrighty.
18:50:20 So, what would you okay sorry. Before we get into your new health goals, I'm gonna go back and ask about the text messages. What are your thoughts about the text messages this week.
18:50:34 Good.
18:50:38 I like to self care bingo cards made us really nice.
18:50:46 Um, let's see.
18:50:49 I am the virtual self camping though.
18:50:57 I spent time in nature.
18:50:58 I got the hours of sleep.
18:51:00 I heard my parents.
18:51:04 I drink a cup of tea.
18:51:06 I caught up with friends on Friday night I went out with my friends, so like that was also like a little bit self care because we went out and only not like burgers, fries and milk shakes like that was a lot.
18:51:19 And then we got we got something else for dessert, but yeah that was really good.
18:51:29 I complimented myself.
18:51:47 So hot shower, did you want to take like more bath stuff.
18:51:43 And, but I will say that I am getting a personal trainer, especially for the summer, I kept my parents and because they have like a lot of personal trainer friend.
18:51:55 And so we're going to see if like one of them can train me and I'm thinking of going like two to three times a week, every month, not every morning but like in the morning.
18:52:09 So yeah, it's exciting for the summer, When you start setting.
18:52:22 Well,
18:52:22 yeah, actually did like the picture of like the kitchen.
18:52:30 The picture
18:52:33 yet and i i just like seeing like aesthetic Mexican Mexican but like these kitchens, like almost like authentic or festive in a way. Yeah, yeah,
18:52:55 yeah definitely the one was like the image stood out to me.
18:53:03 Tommy are the ones that kind of like me
18:53:08 know, they weren't, man.
18:53:13 But like, for me personally I just associate things better when I see when I visualize it. Or like, when I touch it,
18:53:34 like it, it connects things a little better with the visuals.
18:53:30 Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Any other comments about the text message.
18:53:41 Oh, I suppose, in the morning.
18:53:46 Activities jogging or swimming.
18:53:49 And I actually do want to try something.
18:53:53 I want to see if like I can try to get into that, but I know where I would go near my house good.
18:54:02 Yeah, but I but I do want to try something.
18:54:06 Okay, That's a good goal, and they're like a future goal, and so it's not quite attainable right now.
18:54:14 Do you plan on going to USF in the fall.
18:54:21 You know the pole at the school jam.
18:54:26 Right, Yeah.
18:54:32 Yeah, I mean I feel like the first couple times I may be like a little bit me cuz I'm on it but yeah definitely I do want to like practice it once a week, but I definitely.
18:54:49 Oh, but the good thing is that my friend she's like, humble trainer, but she's like really good right now. So, my friend and I are going to pay her to train us it's like wait for me get back to us is that correct.
18:55:04 That's exciting.
18:55:04 That is super exciting.
18:55:06 It's gonna be like a group, group. Yeah, yeah.
18:55:12 Cool.
18:55:13 Maybe I'll see you there when they.
18:55:17 Yes.
18:55:21 Okay, well, what would you like to focus on this week.
18:55:30 Um, I think.
18:55:34 I don't even know but I just like mana right, but at the same time, study for finance.
18:55:45 Yeah.
18:55:51 So, no, it's okay. Like, I think, a form of, like, there's also everyone's like second.
18:56:05 Um, can you still hear me.
18:56:07 Yes.
18:56:09 So, we can think about your academics as part of your health because it can be like a stressor, but if you focus on it, it could be stress relieving.
18:56:21 So, yeah.
18:56:22 The other thing is like when you're experiencing so much outer stress or like social stress.
18:56:31 For example, academics. This is like a critical time to practice self care.
18:56:36 So, you know, whether that be like a five minute self care activity or whether that be like a 15 minute, like 15 minutes for yourself during this stressful time might be might be helpful, rather than like destructive.
18:56:53 So, if you want to set a goal around sleeping like prioritizing sleep for eight hours, or doing a self care activity or scheduling time for studying, like all of those things could be are helpful this week, not sorry, one of all of those things.
18:57:14 Right.
18:57:17 I'm gonna happen.
18:57:18 I don't come not sleep finally 12 man.
18:57:23 My body will just crush, like I've tried to stay up to stay up for owners, but I just cannot.
18:57:31 Like, I literally open my laptop and I'm going to tell me get this done.
18:57:34 From like 12am to 2am, and I crashed like I just cannot like I need sleep.
18:57:43 So I think setting my bed time from 12 to seven is one of my goals for this.
18:58:04 think that's a little hard for me to like phrase into a SMART goal Can you do it, like, how do you want me to word it. So in the next week.
18:58:15 And then I will on in the next week. I will
18:58:22 get
18:58:27 seven to eight hours of sleep with a fixed schedule.
18:58:38 I have learned that like if you sleep eight hours a week, but at different times like it's not, it's not busy.
18:58:53 Sorry, I didn't hear we said you learned that if you get eight hours of sleep a night or something.
18:59:02 But if you get eight hours sleep.
18:59:06 But like a different time like it's not good for you because I'm, like, let's say I sleep from 12 to eight and eight.
18:59:17 And then the next day I sleep from like 4am like Talia like that just that time.
18:59:29 That time changes affecting me more than like
18:59:35 not sleeping eight hours a day.
18:59:52 Gotcha.
18:59:43 Yep.
18:59:46 Yep.
18:59:49 Gotcha.
19:00:02 So, for you. Why is this goal important that we have with my anxiety and depression.
19:00:08 And because every time
19:00:12 I see.
19:00:17 I still want more fresh and jittery.
19:00:33 Okay. So I'll just repeat the goal, just to make sure I noted it accurately.
19:00:44 So in the next week you will get seven to eight hours of sleep a night with a fixed schedule. This means going to bed at 12am and waking up at seven 8pm or 8am sorry.
19:00:55 Okay.
19:00:56 And this call will help you manage your anxiety and depression, feel less jittery and more refreshed, would you say throughout the day.
19:01:10 Yes. Also, in the morning, more specific in the morning.
19:01:20 So, um, what, what structures or what things, will you need to help you meet this goal.
19:01:33 So, actually a couple
19:01:39 log off.
19:01:41 media for the rest of the semester.
19:01:44 Cuz I think I'm like okay I have three weeks left, I can.
19:01:49 I like me to take a break, can I spend way too much time on Instagram,
19:01:57 Which is like in a way it's good because I find out like everything that's going on that's not in the news.
19:02:17 But at the same time, like, I need, like I just have a lot of work to do. I know that I'm not going to get it done if I check my social media like 20%.
19:02:15 So I'm like okay, you have pretty close, you can do it. And then you have three months of like, no school.
19:02:22 Definitely, I think, one of my social media will help about, I work on social media, like my job is to manage social media, but it's not like council should be one.
19:02:39 Also personal social media.
19:02:41 Yeah.
19:02:51 What, what other things do you think would be helpful to help you meet your goal.
19:03:16 Maybe like eating like with a routine.
19:03:30 So, eating at a certain time, at a certain time, lunch at a certain time and then to know certain time, because the night, he, like
19:03:42 me, Scorpion much, not like a million bucks.
19:03:52 I think that could be like a whole new health goal if you want to be.
19:04:05 Um, I think, for, for this one, it might complicate it a little bit.
19:04:05 Yeah.
19:04:12 So I can give you some other examples if that's helpful.
19:04:19 Yep. So, um, one thing could be like, signing off your computer, by 1130, that can help you make sure you get to bed by midnight, or so you can set an alarm for yourself, just so that you can start your bedtime routine.
19:04:44 You can.
19:05:05 okay so what would help you not ignore them.
19:05:10 The laptop, like sending off 1130.
19:05:16 Okay.
19:05:25 Okay.
19:05:26 Is there anything that I can do to help you meet your goal.
19:05:33 I'm reminded help the ones on the calendar are the ones on the phone.
19:05:52 I'm both.
19:05:44 Okay.
19:05:47 And then, where would you want the reminders to be
19:05:57 what they want, sorry. You couldn't.
19:06:01 What would you want me to write in the reminder, and at what time.
19:06:18 Oh, maybe like for the,
19:06:31 for the computer one, maybe one on Thursday night and the minute Friday night
19:06:42 at 1130.
19:06:56 If
19:06:56 you just want me to do it on Friday on Thursday.
19:07:01 Yeah, and
19:07:08 also like Sunday
19:07:12 and Monday will be me.
19:07:22 So, I'm honest scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level and maybe you're SMART goal
19:07:34 Okay,
19:07:44 you in a sec let's make
19:07:49 it.
19:07:50 Oh, are you interested in meeting a second goal, making a second goal this week I'm sorry.
19:07:58 Oh,
19:08:01 I don't know.
19:08:05 I don't want to overwhelm you.
19:08:07 So if you're okay with setting one goal I think that's a good starting point.
19:08:16 Yeah, I think we'll just stay there like that for now.
19:08:21 Okay.
19:08:23 Um, so I'll just repeat the goal in the next week you will get seven to eight hours of sleep a night with a fixed schedule. This means going to bed at midnight, and waking up between seven and eight.
19:08:43 So, um, this, unfortunately, is our last health coaching session.
19:08:51 I can't believe it's already been four weeks.
19:08:56 I'm rolling. Yeah.
19:09:00 Well, I won't be able to like meet with you again.
19:09:06 But I'll still check in with you there through text message and I'll send you those calendar invites, so don't feel like you're alone like I've left you I'll still be here for one.
19:09:24 Um, and, and there's in terms of next steps for the program. Sorry, can you hear me okay, by the way, maybe I can, yeah.
19:09:34 Okay.
19:09:35 So for next steps, there's two. One is a follow up survey, which is very similar to the first one that you took but it's a lot less time. And then the second step is meeting with another person from the team to do a follow up, or we're calling them like
19:09:56 a feedback meeting. So, you would just meet with them to provide your feedback about your experience and anything we can do to improve the program.
19:10:09 And so this meeting is usually about 40 to 60 minutes long.
19:10:16 Do you think you can meet at this time next week.
19:10:46 I'm
19:10:36 know, Can we do Tuesday.
19:10:41 Next week.
19:10:46 Yeah.
19:10:46 What time on Tuesday, anytime before.
19:10:50 6pm.
19:10:57 So, let me reach back out to the team and see who can meet with you before Tuesday 6pm. Is there a preferred time like, do you want to meet at the lunch hour, or like 3pm.
19:11:21 Be like 3pm.
19:11:23 Okay.
19:11:26 I can do, anytime after two.
19:11:31 And before 6pm.
19:11:39 Okay.
19:11:44 So I'll send you a Google in by, um, you should receive the link to the survey won't send you the Google invite until you fill out the survey though because we need you to fill out the survey before doing the, the follow up meeting.
19:12:02 Okay.
19:12:04 Any questions about those two things.
19:12:09 No, wait. So do you graduate this.
19:12:12 No I don't finish until the end of next fall.
19:12:21 Okay, I'm like, okay, so I will definitely see you around campus hopefully in the fall.
