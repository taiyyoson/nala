10:01:02 Good morning.
10:01:04 Morning.
10:01:07 how are you today.
10:01:09 A little sore cook good.
10:01:12 That's a good feeling like it.
10:01:17 And so how did you do their goal this last week.
10:01:20 So how did you do their goal this last week. I did pretty good, I missed. Just yesterday.
10:01:24 Yesterday was super stressful so I was, you know I'm just gonna not today.
10:01:30 Anthony, you need a break. And so you mentioned, it was quite stressful yesterday but overall during the week.
10:01:48 How would you rate your stress level on a scale from one to 10.
10:01:43 I'm probably like a three or two just because it was a pretty bland week it was just yesterday was like a day of chaos and it ended really well so I'm fine.
10:01:54 Okay.
10:01:55 And in terms of your progress for your goals.
10:02:01 On a scale of one to 10 How would you say that you're doing and meeting that goal that you set for yourself.
10:02:14 I would say like an eight, nine or 10, but I did sprained my ankle over the week, so I wasn't able to run or anything, and then I kind of took that as well, will deduct that 10 minutes from working out but instead, today I was like No, we're going to
10:02:26 go on a walk, instead of a run. So, yeah.
10:02:31 Using myself but trying not to.
10:02:34 Yeah, and just I think you brought up a great point that sometimes we get it adjusting So, yes, maybe you couldn't run but you could walk. And that's another form of aerobic activity that you could do.
10:02:50 Right.
10:02:50 Well done. That's a great modification, and it's part of problem solving, too. So very, very good.
10:02:58 What else did you want to check in about today, What do you focus off where this upcoming week.
10:03:06 Thank you.
10:03:09 Oh, I'm not too sure I think maybe the.
10:03:13 The one thing I'm really bad at lately is eating breakfast, and that's because I honestly, I don't like breakfast food and I don't have much of an appetite in the morning.
10:03:23 I'm starving. So it's kind of weird I'll be like my stomach is growling off the charts, but my everything else is kind of like, you don't want any of this food.
10:03:33 So I think that's something I want to try working on is being consistent with eating breakfast at least, whether it's like a good little bar or a bowl of cereal or something, because I've noticed if I don't eat breakfast, then the rest of my eating patterns
10:03:49 for the day are completely thrown off.
10:03:55 Yes, and I don't know if you've any for this in the past but wait man, I mean, this is just about, I guess just an energy levels, let's just put it that way.
10:04:08 Because a lot of the programs that I do talk about weight and weight management, but if you just think about energy level, at all.
10:04:14 You've been fasting for, you know, six, eight hours depending on how much you slept.
10:04:23 So your body does need something in the morning. What you'll give it. Sometimes it's not as important as long as it's something that is somewhat nutritious right because that's going to be your feel as you begin the day.
10:04:36 So something small, even if it's, you know, a granola bar, like you mentioned, or some cereal in the morning, that will give you that, that it will kick start your day.
10:04:47 Yeah, I think the challenge is that I'm really picky eater, or at least I was a lot more pickier and I'm starting to expand my palate. But I know like I should probably like eat an apple in the morning but for some reason like my mind doesn't process,
10:05:03 Apple instead of like if there was a cake, I would eat a slice of cake for breakfast.
10:05:09 It's really bad so I don't know how to get my mindset to be a little bit more healthy and less like, I'm just going to eat whatever is in front of me, even though it's not a lot but it's not healthy.
10:05:22 Give me some ideas and not have our cake.
10:05:25 So, I heard about this one. I personally have not tried it but.
10:05:30 And if you have an oven, it might be made yet, but I hear that people might sometimes cut up apples and put just like cinema on them.
10:05:40 And I hope my mouth watering. And, and that makes it easier for them to like eat it and it's more like a desert.
10:05:48 So I'm wondering if there's a way that you could prep that maybe the day before and you just have it ready in the fridge for the morning and you would just like warm it up, and that would take that will be like two in one it would give you the, the idea
10:06:04 the eating the apple but also the idea that maybe you're eating dessert in the morning. Yeah, I think that's definitely a good point like it kind of reminds me when I was growing up in like, in order to ghost eat my dad would put like cinnamon sugar on
10:06:19 the bread and butter and whatnot and I was like oh this is delicious.
10:06:24 But yeah i think that's that's smart kind of just figuring out okay well what can I create that'll be something I'm willing to eat in the mornings and that's kind of already ready yeah and and tricking the the taste buds right, and the brain to think,
10:06:39 And, and tricking the the taste buds right, and the brain to think, oh it's to say. Right.
10:06:44 I don't know, no.
10:06:46 So you're thinking, having practice in the morning.
10:06:52 How many days this upcoming week do you want to focus on practice.
10:06:57 Hopefully every day, because every day wake up story.
10:07:02 And it's so like uncomfortable like I literally wake up at like five in the morning because my stomach is growling, and and I'm like okay but I don't want to eat anything so how's this going to work so I'm drinking a bunch of water in the morning early,
10:07:15 I'll sneak in a granola bar but then, like 10 o'clock comes and I'm so hungry and I'm like, Hmm, maybe this is like the time to eat like actual breakfast food, as opposed to like six in the morning.
10:07:29 And when you're thinking of every day is that five days of the week or seven days.
10:07:35 Probably something.
10:07:43 Is there.
10:07:45 Can you think of something else to it potentially include maybe like some type of protein.
10:07:56 In the morning,
10:07:55 or you want to start at least with
10:07:59 because I'm trying to help us visualize what it would look like, so that it can help you.
10:08:07 Let's say tomorrow morning you know okay, I can have this, and you don't have to think about it in the morning.
10:08:13 I'm going to look up foods with protein because I'm so bad at that.
10:08:18 And, I mean, the reason why I ask is, for some things that I've had in the past AP protein, but it really depends on your dietary needs like are you lactose intolerant.
10:08:42 Because if you are then I would not suggest like Cottage Cheese Cottage Cheese is something that you can mix with fruit and it's it's fairly.
10:08:41 It also it makes me think of having dessert.
10:08:45 I'm having, you know, kind of to have fruit that that could be simple, or eating yogurt yogurt with fruit in the morning. Yeah.
10:08:57 And one thing yogurt I would just be careful that it's not like flavor because the flavor attempts to have a bit of sugar.
10:09:05 Sugar is not a problem and you're not watching your sugar levels, then it might not be too much of a big deal but anything flavor tends to have a lot of added sugar in it.
10:09:18 And if you're adding fruit and you already have natural.
10:09:23 Yeah, I think that's an issue for me I mean my partner always, not necessarily jokes but kind of hints that. At this rate, I have a high rate of getting diabetic at the, you know, by my 30s because I do a lot of sugars and a drink soda, a lot.
10:09:42 And that's basically like my main source of fuel which is why I have low energy all the time because it burns so quickly.
10:09:50 So I think that's definitely something I want to incorporate as well as being less inclined to eat like the junk food like I looked over to my left because that's where my junk food like area is.
10:10:03 And I should probably get rid of that would say, you already have those items and maybe have them in moderation and once they're done, they're done.
10:10:15 But definitely, when you go to grocery shopping next time.
10:10:29 I'm a great believer in that we have to do baby steps because sometimes when we eliminate everything all of a sudden, then our body does not like that.
10:10:38 And that's how we crash and then we start all over again, you know. So, yeah, little by little, we gotta. It also, it's a purely about teeth but sometimes like you have to get your taste buds used to, like, Can you taste and trying something new.
10:10:55 Yeah, definitely. Maybe that'll be kind of like something else I do this week is trying to try some new foods like I know there's a bunch of fruit out there that I have never had, especially now with them with spring being here and summer coming soon.
10:11:11 there's a lot more fresh produce.
10:11:14 And that can also give you an idea of when you go grocery shopping, what are some in season products to think about because when we buy in season. They also tend to taste a lot better.
10:11:29 Okay, so we have eating a morning meal or seven days of the week.
10:11:33 And how confident, do you feel about being able to do this.
10:11:40 I would say like presently at like a five or six just because I still don't really know what it is that I'm going to be eaten in the mornings.
10:11:50 Yeah, so I think that's definitely something I need to figure out in terms of okay well, if you're going to eat what are you going to eat, because I know when I wake up in the mornings it's always the matter of well, I already know what's here.
10:12:05 So, you want it, you can.
10:12:07 So in thinking of the goal, he mentioned five or six How can we, and you mentioned, what some of the challenges might be, how about we we do a little bit more brainstorming on what it can look like that way we can increase their confidence level.
10:12:32 So what are some thoughts that you have or things that you can include in as part of your morning you do like to make french toast that's like the one thing I can make, but I do admit I'm really lazy when it comes to going to the kitchen, I'm like, oh
10:12:40 my god, I don't want to put in 20 minutes of work into this food when I'm going to eat it in five, that's like such a bad mentality to have but I'm trying to work through it.
10:12:50 So I think maybe like pushing myself to like actually make my food as opposed to just not being willing, because I do like eating french toast and like waffles, my brother did give me a waffle maker last Christmas.
10:13:04 So, I should be you may be using that a little bit more.
10:13:10 And you could absolutely incorporate some fruit into that.
10:13:16 You think.
10:13:19 Think. Yeah, sir. Oh, very good ideas.
10:13:28 Yeah. And then, I mean, I do like eating conscious in the morning to, if I hit him up.
10:13:35 But it's not necessarily like a meal, it would be more like the snack to hold me over before I eat. So, that would be maybe if I like literally can't think of anything else I want to eat, then go to go to a pastry and get at least some, some fun.
10:13:55 Okay.
10:13:57 I just have ideas of things that you could potentially have I know earlier you mentioned having a granola bar so maybe think of what are some fast.
10:14:18 morning. For the days that you just don't feel like cooking for example.
10:14:22 Yeah.
10:14:27 Some other things that have also like tried in the past is with fruit specifically.
10:14:34 I really enjoy fruit in the morning and maybe that's just like a personal choice and but I could, I will cut it up ahead of time and just keep those in the fridge.
10:14:44 That way, they're easily available and then in the morning I don't have to be cutting things.
10:14:49 You know, I'm not fully awake at night, Chuck finger.
10:14:53 Just as immediate.
10:14:57 And sometimes I even just get the frozen stuff that's already cut up and keep, keep that at hand.
10:15:04 So it's kind of very son.
10:15:09 And I have been like recommended to like make smoothies and stuff for mornings, it's just a matter of figuring out what type of some of the I like and I guess just trying it.
10:15:21 Yeah.
10:15:23 Are there so are you think for smoothies, are you do you lean more towards like the vegetable smoothies or the fruit smoothies, or maybe a combination.
10:15:35 I've never actually had a vegetable smoothie before I really don't drink smoothies like it, I'll only sip someone's smoothie if they're like begging me to try it, and I usually am like, That's gross.
10:15:46 But it's just because like you said like I haven't gotten my taste buds used to it and so for me it's just like the avoidance has made me not like it but i think i think i would probably lean more towards like the fruit smoothies.
10:16:12 Okay.
10:16:02 Let's see if I can find some easy recipes.
10:16:07 You're always want to give me like Jamba Juice gift cards I'm like no I don't drink smoothies don't give them to me.
10:16:14 I mean, and I think you, you, you want to maybe try to make some and see. That way you could modify the ingredients and help your taste buds I just mean that way I teach myself to like smoothies.
10:16:30 Yeah. That might be a different way to do it to any other goals that you're thinking for this week or do you want to stick to this one for now and see how it goes.
10:16:41 I think this is fine and then keeping up my exercise goal I definitely want to keep that going.
10:16:48 Okay, so for for that I know you were doing an hour.
10:16:52 Did you want to stay with the hour, or did you want to modify the time for this week.
10:17:00 I think I want to keep it up the hour, like last time.
10:17:09 I'll send you a summary of both. And I'll include what you've been working on in the past so that it's, it's part of this one again.
10:17:19 And let me know if you find the email useful if there's maybe additional resources that you want me to include like things that I think about, maybe even after session like oh I should have mentioned this and, because I know you had mentioned something
10:17:33 about balanced meal so remember there's like a site that has information about meal planning and I'll share that.
10:17:43 But this time I look for some items around. Healthy Families, and let's see what.
10:17:51 Thank you.
10:17:53 And for the physical activity goal how confident, do you feel about being able to achieve that.
10:18:00 I would say like a nine.
10:18:01 Yeah, just because it's been going pretty well. Yeah.
10:18:06 So that's good.
10:18:12 Any other goals. I think to our guys.
10:18:16 Yeah, I think that's good for now I have a lot going on for school so
10:18:36 I think you're, you're at very, we're in good shape for this week or goal. So,
10:18:30 in terms of the messages that you received this week, were there any text messages that stood out to you that you thought, Oh, I never really thought about that or Oh, I know that or.
10:18:41 Oh, I might want to do that.
10:18:45 I think they're kind of more like daily reminders of like things I already know but it's kind of like necessary because even though I know it doesn't even doing it.
10:18:56 So it's kind of like another push of like remember this is important.
10:19:01 So I think yeah like the exercise and the fruit and stuff it's kind of like remember bringing these are things you want to work on.
10:19:08 Yeah, and I fully agree.
10:19:12 Sometimes Yeah, and I was when we were developing the messages we were talking about how. None of this information is revolutionary in terms of oh it's brand new, but it's those daily reminders like you said that we need in order to kind of push us and
10:19:29 hopefully move us into that actions they really need to be
10:19:38 very good.
10:19:37 Any other questions, thoughts.
10:19:41 Anything else you want to check in about today.
10:19:45 Um, I don't think so.
10:19:48 Yeah, not that I can think of, just get through every day.
10:19:53 I know,
10:19:56 I would say you have two very good goals for this week. I will send you a summary, by the end of today, and add any resources that I can find for to give you ideas for reading practice meals are there, I know you mentioned, you're not a fan of practice
10:20:13 food.
10:20:14 But are there certain foods that you really do enjoy, and maybe they can become part of the morning routine.
10:20:22 Just to give me some ideas as I'm looking things up.
10:20:25 Yeah, I mean I'm a big cost of person but I don't know if that's really a breakfast thing, and, but I will say I love eating like beans and rice in the morning, that's always a good go to or if my mom is willing to make me a bean and cheese burrito because
10:20:41 I'm not willing to even make that she that's always a really good go to in the morning when I'm like, like feeling sick and I need to like you can maybe I should be eating more beans and rice.
10:20:55 Oh yeah. Protein Yeah, that's a good protein in the money. There you go.
10:21:00 I will ask my Thea to make it because that's where my mom gets her beans and rice she does not make it herself. Yeah.
10:21:09 She just pre make so for you, you could keep that in the fridge don't start a thing that lasts for a bit of time if you can mark retreated.
10:21:18 Like,
10:21:20 we go to my theater, what do we eat beans, rice and tamales like it's just not like that here. Yeah, yeah.
10:21:29 If you're at the accessible issue nearby. Yeah, my mom goes to her house every weekend.
10:21:35 Okay, then yes, then some food.
10:21:39 Yeah, that's definitely possible then, that's good.
10:21:43 See, sometimes it's good to just have these conversations because things kind of pop up.
10:21:50 I was like really thinking like great what breakfast or like what breakfast, it was like rice.
10:21:57 and and that's well as I mentioned the idea of what food do you enjoy in general, and I think we always think of, oh this is what breakfast looks good food should look like, like lunch and dinner.
10:22:12 But, I mean, at the end of the day food is food and you need to feed your body. So just make sure that it's something that you enjoy and I'm a proponent of having pasta for practice thing.
10:22:24 If you like it, you should be able to have it.
10:22:27 Now I'm thinking of like wealth is like I'll eat wealth is in the morning, no problem. So, now I'm like hungrier.
10:22:37 I know, hopefully it'll push you to get some more ideas and then as the week goes by you'll have more options of things that you are able to eat in the morning.
