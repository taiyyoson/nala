12:02:38 So that was nice. It's just like, I'm glad I went the days that I went because after that my week just turned crazy. He went from Monday to Friday like that.
12:02:49 No, I'm glad I went when I did.
12:02:52 Yeah, I remember last time you had kind of shared more about like the benefits of having gone. Did you see those benefits again.
12:03:02 Yeah, I see being spin good time management has been good. I've just yeah this week was crazy but in a good way like busy.
12:03:17 Yeah, it's been a big improvement like I actually miss going and I look forward to when I do have days versus like dreading it before I think because I was trying to do that like five in the morning stuff and nobody likes to wake up at that time.
12:03:32 So now I actually look forward to it because I don't have that pressure of like having to go at a certain time it's just as long as I go. Yeah, cool, I like that.
12:03:43 Yeah.
12:03:50 Um, so, with the question like the scale questions. I'm on a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did in meeting your goal for sure a 10.
12:03:57 Okay, awesome.
12:03:59 And then the stress question on a scale of one to 10, what do you think your stress level has been like this week, like a two.
12:04:08 Oh okay, so busy but not stressful. Yeah.
12:04:12 It's been good busy in a good way.
12:04:18 Cool, to hear. Are you done with classes as well.
12:04:24 No.
12:04:27 Why has gone down yeah all this
12:04:31 free time, essentially, not really.
12:04:35 So it's nice to not have a few weeks off till summer starts.
12:04:41 Go cool.
12:04:43 And what do you, I like Do you have any plans for this time, like any trip anywhere self care activities. Yeah, I'm going to Hawaii for a week, week.
12:04:55 How exciting Have you been before. No, it's gonna be my first time so that's like yeah I have an appointment and I have to get like everything ready today and this I work tomorrow so it's like I only have basically party today and then Sunday to like
12:05:15 get last minute things. Well, I wonder you going to.
12:05:17 Allahu so I'm going to Honolulu.
12:05:20 Huh. Okay.
12:05:23 I've never been to that island before, but Hawaii has the best activities like high water activities hiking activities. I'm so I'm so excited for you.
12:05:35 I'm so excited so yes I'm looking forward to that.
12:05:41 And then I'll come back and have like a few days off before classes my summer classes start so, yeah, it was a good, good break. Yes, very much needed.
12:05:56 also. Awesome. Well, I will be wishing you like all good energy.
12:06:04 Yes.
12:06:06 I'm so excited for it. I just studies and relax. Yeah and adventure.
12:06:13 Like slow down from the city life the work life just have fun, fun I'm so pal like warm water, like, oh my god I'm looking forward to it so much. Yeah.
12:06:31 So, Okay, I wonder, so for since this is our last health coaching session. I wonder like what you would want your health goal to be, um, and maybe it could be as simple as like 10 minutes in the sun to get your vitamin D.
12:06:49 I know I need that. Or like drink water while you're in Hawaii because I know you're going to be like in the sun a lot and is really hot may know the humidity, I'm not looking forward to that I don't like the heat, but I'm like hopefully we're going to
12:07:05 spend a lot of time in the water where I won't feel like, and then it's just temporary so it'll be nice. My health goal is to still try to do something like active not necessarily going to the gym but like we're going to have a few hikes planned out maybe
12:07:24 like riding bikes or something. And like you said like going out.
12:07:30 The sun, but yeah my health goal overall to just do something active, at least one today, some type of activity that gets me up and moving and not just sitting around eating all day.
12:07:46 Okay.
12:07:47 I wonder if you like I'm just gonna throw this out there and let me know if it lands.
12:07:55 I think being active every day is going to be in a really great goal. And also, if we can frame it as self care because I think that's the whole point of your trip is just to like take a break, and I want your goal to be maybe a little more aligned with
12:08:13 that and if you feel being active once a day aligns with that. Cool. if you feel like I'm just going to take like a break, back could be a helpful in itself like I wanted to be like fun.
12:08:29 And like low bar for you.
12:08:32 Yeah, I mean I don't want that pressure of like having to go to the gym. But I do want to explore the island and do fun things so even if it's like swimming or snorkeling like that's still an activity where your men Baby, you know.
12:08:58 Cool. So, I find self care, plus good for your body so it's like a good round about.
12:08:53 Yeah, mind, body, soul type of thing. Yeah. Are you going with.
12:08:58 So I have a friend that lives there now so she just moved there so I'm visiting her and then another friend from San Diego, who I went to school with because I went to college down there, she's meeting me there so it's gonna be like the three amigos linking
12:09:16 up together.
12:09:16 Nice on that in San Diego,
12:09:28 be so fun. Nice like those girls time. It's a girls trip
12:09:29 needed. So, for your health goal.
12:09:32 In the next week, you will have, how do you want me to finish that.
12:09:47 I'm
12:09:47 saying the next week, I will.
12:09:55 And do one fun and active activity per day.
12:10:09 And then do you want this to be like for five days or seven days I'm not sure what the five, because like I'm there a total of seven but the travel days don't really count.
12:10:22 So I had like five real days there.
12:10:25 Yeah.
12:10:27 Cool.
12:10:28 And so, um, let's see, we have it specific we have a measurable so like one activity a day obtainable you're going to be in a beautiful place to have a lot of activities.
12:10:40 Yeah.
12:10:41 And you did speak to this already but like, why is it important to you.
12:10:49 I'm just like you said like self care so like some peace of mind, helps with stress, as well as just like trying something new.
12:11:02 Yeah.
12:11:06 Like that. Cool.
12:11:11 So, I'm on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level of confidence in meeting your sparkle.
12:11:18 A 10. I like that.
12:11:21 Only because activities already booked and, like, I'm not going on vacation is sitting in a house all day. So, yes it is going to be a 10.
12:11:31 Make sure to try pack a water bottle like a reusable water bottle in sunscreen and bug spray, like if you get the mosquitoes, like a lie. Pack.
12:11:45 spray some blog. I need to get like a big be tat I might just buy that over there. Mm hmm.
12:12:06 And, oh I just bought one of those, like cell phone waterproof patches I get my phone with me, because before I always leave my phone behind because I've never done anything like this extent but I'm like I want to take pictures or at least record some
12:12:24 of this stuff, you know, yeah.
12:12:28 It's gonna be so cool. My partner and I did that too and we got like two videos under water and we have like these, like, really cool fish. Yeah.
12:12:38 So I just bought that that came in the mail I got it on Amazon, so I'm like excited for that. Yeah, and yeah just I got a good last minute stuff definitely the bug spray though
12:12:54 versus mosquito attacked.
12:12:57 Yeah.
12:12:59 So when I get both sick so I need to get like the motion sickness pills. Hmm.
12:13:05 So that's like I need to get a lot of those.
12:13:10 Then some water activities are like everyday basically.
12:13:14 The other thing that I would recommend is a waterproof bag.
12:13:18 So they like an actual bag like a purse or backpack. Yeah, it's, it kind of looks like a two, and then you roll it up and then you clip it together. I can probably send you an Amazon link for that, just so that you kind of get an idea of what I'm talking
12:13:34 about. But if you go on like a boat. They might provide it for you.
12:13:40 But if you're doing other activities, it might just be helpful to have a something like I didn't even know that existed like I'm taking a backpack the little backpack is water resistant like it's like that, much like windbreaker material, kind of, oh
12:13:58 yeah, not waterproof.
12:14:00 Yeah. Yeah. Okay, email me links or if you have any recommendations I go on next weekend.
12:14:05 Yeah, I think yeah it'll give you plenty of time to buy something this one looks kind of nice. Oh, and it comes with it comes with the case for the phone sorry.
12:14:15 Oh. Oh.
12:14:22 Yeah, it's called a dry bag, dry bag. Yeah, I'll send you I'll send you a link anyways, but we so what Island Did you go to.
