12:01:15 thank you message for 50183034.
12:03:13 I know it took a year maybe something else came up I'll give her a few minutes and then I'll try it.
12:03:27 Good how's it going for you today.
12:03:41 Final.
12:03:53 It's, it's much needed at this point I feel we've been going for a while so it's time for a little break.
12:04:07 Yeah.
12:04:07 Well I'm glad that we do need, and as you know today is also our last session, or the program itself.
12:04:17 And towards the end of today, I'll give you more information about next steps and follow up.
12:04:24 However, until we get to that point.
12:04:27 I do want to review the power of the week when how your goals went.
12:04:34 How did it go for this last week.
12:04:41 Hello, can you hear me. Yeah.
12:04:43 Yes.
12:04:48 It was like it was actually able to do more than I want us to live with the recipes.
12:04:59 I think ever since we did that first goal of the water is kind of been built along the way and that kind of helped me.
12:05:23 In a way, because I, you know, kind of like I like like water all the time I was like okay this past week I was asking people to like that day right now. One recipe.
12:05:28 That's all I had time for but I had time to write that one right now and then I just sent my boyfriend to buy it online I know that I cannot do it today.
12:05:42 I can always do Wednesday, but then I was like, kind of in my head, what is this what is. So I just kind of sent him the five things thing, and I was able to cook.
12:05:46 And then over the weekend I actually did a longer list, and then went to go buy groceries on Sunday for this week.
12:05:56 So I kind of started cooking more like yesterday's kind of feels nice to get those
12:06:04 way instead of being company in the microwave.
12:06:14 Like. Go. Go.
12:06:20 The kind of fell like
12:06:20 that.
12:06:22 Yeah, no of course I mean I always want to know about your progress and sort of how you feel that you're doing on like a scale of one to 10, but I mean it sounds like you're doing really great.
12:06:35 I mean it was.
12:06:38 Think I told you kids like over the other days, actually, like, you know, complete your goals, whether it's eating healthy you're drinking some water like but other people don't see everything daily basis but I think because of all the stress.
12:06:59 You know, sometimes I could forget, and honestly I didn't really forget about the goal, but one thing that I realized is even not only just like talking to clients, but like talking to myself, I actually like every time we come up with an old like you're
12:07:19 very, very, you want to be very specific and no like that has made me feel more specific become like well I want to do this or I want to do that, that I even asked myself.
12:07:51 What's back pain like how to get, you know, twice a week is good or maybe even one, like something that's doable, but kind of just that's just like a
12:07:51 lie like something that I noticed this week is more like specific is like okay I'm gonna do this, like, Okay, how many times or what am I gonna do or how to do it, all these questions that you've been asking me every time it comes to goals, and really
12:08:04 hopeful that is so good. No, that's great and I mean that's really the goal to get you to think of this specifics.
12:08:11 And, I mean today will be our last day but I'll send you a little handout about smart planning or more SMART goal planning, which can help you if you sort of put it, if you're able to print it or just have it somewhere where you can see it from time to
12:08:26 time I think it will be a great reminder of those questions that we need to ask ourselves when we're setting some kind of plan or goal.
12:08:38 You, you brought up a little bit about how at times when there's like a certain level of stress, you might forget to do things for example.
12:08:46 So, and this. This week, what would you say was your stress level on a scale of one to 10.
12:09:02 I think
12:08:59 maybe like eight and a half,
12:09:03 spend a lot going on, especially with the end of semester right.
12:09:10 Yeah, I think it really just work maybe, you know, you're happy
12:09:17 presentation for me and it just kind of make a little more of you.
12:09:23 And what are you hoping to check in about today, or what would you like to focus on for this week.
12:09:38 Here, kind of,
12:09:46 like, I reflect back on the need around like myself, that a little bit.
12:09:57 Time and kind of like waking up early and kind of, I don't care of myself but I think this week I really want to dress some things that I kind of define like for me.
12:10:13 And I came and I thought of it because of the picture that was sent to ship ago of self care and
12:10:23 self care Bingo.
12:10:27 Yeah, and the little graphic actually has some ideas and things that you can do you need any inspiration.
12:10:34 Some of them are very like simple things but they can make quite a difference by not drinking tea or, or taking a bath, where some of the examples we included.
12:10:49 So in, in ensuring that you're able to achieve your goal and making it specific Do you have a specific activity in mind that you want to do this week to practice self care.
12:11:05 Um, Yeah, I was gonna say like a math.
12:11:09 Like do like do that, like one.
12:11:17 You know what day of the week on what time.
12:11:24 Friday.
12:11:27 How long do you think you want to dedicate to the
12:11:33 hour.
12:11:36 I think if I thought about it more days.
12:11:39 Like, I think, like, health care, that
12:11:49 when there's more time to
12:11:57 see any and how confident, do you feel about being able to do that.
12:12:06 Okay.
12:12:06 Any other goals that you want to set for this upcoming week,
12:12:14 or continue with anything from the previous week I know you had been working on waking up early.
12:12:19 The new recipes making a grocery list.
12:12:38 You know, But I'd like. Yeah, so I think I've been like wanting to do like for healthy.
12:12:44 Yeah. Oh I think I've been like wanting like for healthy booty. Oh, that's something that I think that could also help like, you know, including the water of course but then sometimes when I feel like drinking like a soda or something super sugar and then I can just do a healthy smoothie or something.
12:12:59 Okay.
12:13:00 So are you thinking. So you mentioned your continue with the water.
12:13:04 And we could add that. But then in addition to that you thinking, having a healthy smoothie.
12:13:16 Say that again.
12:13:17 So you mentioned that you want to continue with the water intake. And I can include that as part of your goals, but you also mentioned this movie.
12:13:29 Is that something that you want to do, How many days of the week.
12:13:43 And it's getting more and more now. so incorporate. Are you thinking fruit smoothies.
12:13:55 Three times this week you thinking of doing this for sort of like a practice at lunch or dinner or kind of like a snack sometime in the week, or in the day, it
12:14:14 kind of gives you energy.
12:14:20 Okay, So incorporate fruit smoothies three times this week around lunchtime.
12:14:25 And then you mentioned you continue let me just review.
12:14:31 The water so for water you are doing three bottles of 16 ounces. And you are doing that for days of the week. Do you want to continue doing that four days over week.
12:14:52 Okay, four days.
12:14:52 Yeah.
12:14:52 And, and you want to continue with three water bottles correct.
12:14:59 And then you said five days of the week.
12:15:04 And how confident, do you feel about being able to continue with them with the water intake
12:15:13 and CO and let me ask you about the fruit smoothies how confident, do you feel about being able to incorporate that three times this week
12:15:23 and a half.
12:15:29 It's a strong confidence level, that's good.
12:15:35 Any other successes that you have this week or challenges that you want to problem solve around for today.
12:15:46 Um, I think, probably.
12:15:56 Anything that comes to mind right now.
12:15:56 mean we said, I included three goals I included the self care the water and this movies, and I can send you a summary of all those.
12:16:07 Just so you have those in writing.
12:16:14 I guess also in thinking of today as being our last session I want to get an idea of how you will maintain your health and wellness goals moving forward you have ideas and how you want to do that.
12:16:27 More like writing.
12:16:34 Like, I think getting a journal and writing down everything that I need to do throughout the day and I use it.
12:16:42 I use my computer and then my thought and this is like very helpful but I think, like, accountability, or of actually again I would
12:16:53 use it as a checklist like every Sunday night, what I do is I kind of write down what I need to do every day, like Monday a checklist of what I need to do Monday.
12:17:04 And then I go through it every night like okay I did this check check check check with every day, like they just keeping myself accountable like I would like to try to be, like,
12:17:19 spreading it like, oh drink through bottled water.
12:17:26 So being able to keep track can also help you to stay accountable. And again, I think that's, I mean whatever works for you think of that will work for you and that will make things efficient.
12:17:40 Yeah, that's great that's.
12:17:44 Let's see, you know, in terms of the messages that you received this last week. I know you mentioned that the self care bingo sort of motivated you to spend or dedicate some time to self care, were there any other messages that stood out to you this week,
12:18:05 text messages
12:18:12 before but it was a picture with a salad with
12:18:18 time with my family and like eating a meal together. I really
12:18:24 want, and that's a big goal.
12:18:26 And then,
12:18:34 and I was like, Okay, I was gonna ask why, why were your favorites.
12:18:50 Like with family.
12:19:06 It was absolutely not intentional but I'm glad that it worked out that way.
12:19:09 Yeah.
12:19:12 Well, I'm glad that the messages have been useful and you are going to continue to get messages. I believe you'll get them into this upcoming Sunday.
12:19:26 That might be. They might.
12:19:32 I think they're scheduled to end because you're only getting them for four weeks the same period of time that you meet with with me.
12:19:36 So after those four weeks. Yeah, you won't be getting messages anymore.
12:19:44 Anything else that you want to add or want to discuss today.
12:19:50 Um, no, I think.
12:20:02 I mean, what's all part of it I think that was probably those goals that I had in mind for this week. I think I'm holding myself accountable to like goals and be very specific on like what I can do
12:20:11 that I don't want that energy
12:20:16 don't want that energy up just so busy, but I think I've seen specific to what I can do has been really helped me actually.
12:20:25 Okay, so being specific with what you want.
12:20:44 And as I mentioned, I'll send you the little handout that has just a quick reminder about how to meet goals specific or use the SMART goal setting method, which I think is really helpful to, to help you and all the future goals that you want to me for
12:21:06 create for for yourself whether they're around health and wellness or whether they're around, anything else that you want to accomplish in your life.
12:21:14 I think this is a really good method that helps us think through that process.
12:21:20 know for sure.
12:21:23 So, to continue to focus on the water intake, maybe start including some smoothie so that you have other healthier alternatives for drinks and also dedicate some time to self care because you know that you can have some stressful times coming in.
12:21:41 So let me tonight as I mentioned a little bit earlier. Today's our session for.
12:21:48 And as I told you you set great goals for yourself this week, so I'll send you an email with a summary of the goals and with resources, and then that might be useful for just the SMART goal planning handout.
12:22:03 Anything else that you can think of that might be useful, that you might need my support with for this week with resources.
12:22:15 No, I think, I mean the link that you sent me like every week along with the like the goals like that's been like helpful information.
12:22:28 And I know the meditation once like that you said in the beginning, we kind of talked about, like walking and doing those things like that was also very useful.
12:22:38 I mean, just like reminders I know sometimes I don't respond but I see them like at the end of the day, like I said, it's like a super helpful reminder to reflect because, kind of like that sometimes it's so hard to actually think about like myself when
12:22:53 it's so busy I'm just thinking about what I need to do like willing to get done. And I never kind of reflect things, and take like a few minutes and say, Okay, how am I feeling today are like, have I done this today.
12:23:05 So I think reminders are always like pretty healthy.
12:23:10 Stay a little more accountable to my goal is what I need to get done.
12:23:17 I thought that I had to have a head.
12:23:20 And last week, I added on the email, is this resource for this website called eat fresh, that has the recipes and just so you know that site also has recipes for some movies.
12:23:33 So in case that that helps you.
12:23:36 Yeah, it has the recipes for a bunch of different things so if you need some, some guidance, you can also i can i can add it again on week four, if you want, but it's the link is on week on the email from week three to just
12:24:00 so, So in terms of next steps as I mentioned earlier, you'll receive a few more text messages so feel free to continue to respond with your thoughts.
12:24:09 You're also going to receive a link to a follow up survey through email by the end of today.
12:24:15 The survey is similar to the previous one that you completed in order to enroll in the program.
12:24:21 But it should be a little bit quicker it should take maybe 15 minutes or so after, after you complete the survey, you'll be invited to meet with one of my colleagues from examine, because we do want to ask you a few more questions about your experience,
12:24:39 and we want to get your, your authentic feedback on how to improve the program. So this meeting is typically 40 to 60 minutes.
12:24:51 And I wanted to ask you, what do you think today's Tuesday with a Tuesday work for you. Did you want to schedule that around 1pm just in case, because it won't be with a different person.
12:25:03 It won't be with me.
12:25:05 What are you thinking for them.
12:25:16 more every week kind of changes a little bit like you they will be like a good time to say wonky and let me see who's available Tuesday 1pm.
12:25:34 And then what I'll do is, in the meantime, I'll send you the survey link.
12:25:43 And as you're completing the survey, I'll, I'll solidify the interview, date and time. If for any reason someone is not available that day then reach back to you so that we can schedule a different time that that works for all the parties involved.
12:25:57 Sounds good.
12:25:59 Yeah, but for now have a tentative so next Tuesday, which is the 18th 1pm. Okay.
12:26:10 And if your schedule changes just let us know to.
12:26:19 It is very important that you complete the survey before we invite you to that or. Yeah, because we want we're not going to add you to the calendar invite until we see that you completed the survey so just FYI.
12:26:34 And on the email I'll set a little deadline just kind of keep it on the back of your head.
12:26:41 Any questions about that, like,
12:26:48 well I really want to thank you so much Jennifer for participating in our accelerated program. It's been a pleasure to work with you these last four weeks, I know that.

12:27:09 So hopefully some of the skills that we discussed like the SMART goal planning can continue to help you as you set more goals for the future and achieve them.
12:27:21 So please take care.
