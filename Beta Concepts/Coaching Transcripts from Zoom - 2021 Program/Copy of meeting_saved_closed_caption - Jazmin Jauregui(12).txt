20:34:21 I'm okay I feel like I'm still stressing about stuff.
20:34:26 Okay.
20:34:27 On a scale of one to 10 What's your strength.
20:34:32 Um, I think it's like a by four or five, um, my brown dog got back on her ear so she's like hello bleeding until like I like cleaned out her ear a little bit, and then I like put the cone on her, but I feel like I might have to take her to the vet tomorrow,
20:34:57 I was just going to see like, how would be today. She was a let me touch it, but she was like a hell of bleeding. So there's
20:35:04 that I might go to LA this weekend, like tomorrow I might fly out there but I have to check it with my dad to see if I do.
20:35:15 What's in LA.
20:35:18 So, I had cousins.
20:35:20 Sorry, I, making a mental notes right now of like, making sure I have my flight, and the car rental.
20:35:31 So, I had cousins who lived down the street from me. And then he moved to New York, and then they moved to Texas so I haven't seen these cousins in like 15 years or something.
20:35:42 Oh, they're in LA, and my brother told me about a few days ago, and he's like oh you should go we haven't seen them like I should go like I want to go you know.
20:35:54 Hmm.
20:35:54 So, yeah.
20:36:09 OT drinking.
20:36:15 honor yeah I'm thinking about.
20:36:15 Okay, well,
20:36:18 I guess for today's session where would you like to go.
20:36:26 You could out I'm sorry.
20:36:28 What like for today's session, what do you want to start with Do you want to start with the text messages or check in about your week's goals.
20:36:36 I think check in about two weeks goals if that's okay.
20:36:39 Yeah, definitely. Um, so, on a scale of one to 10, how do you think you did in meeting your goals.
20:36:52 At the pencil goals, we're talking about I think for the like the fruit one. I think I did Wow, I made sure to eat bananas, or strawberries.
20:37:01 So that was good. Um, I like what's the store and I like Bob bag of cuties as well.
20:37:07 I like showed my friends I was like look look I'm eating foods like I'm trying to eat healthy, she was like wow I'm so proud of you.
20:37:21 The water one has been so and so.
20:37:25 I think like the fruit when they give it an eight out of 10.
20:37:30 The water one was so and so I killed me plant twice.
20:37:36 Yeah.
20:37:37 I'm on the right side so when I first started USF. The professor's gave us like the goody bag.
20:37:43 And so I thought it was going to have like USF stuff you know like the USF slider, but, you know, they gave was like this was a call. Like,
20:37:55 that smells good or whatever, they gave us.
20:37:59 They gave us like a picture of the beach because I helped them like calm down and we should find something called me every day or something.
20:38:08 And then this one teacher gave us like this part of soil with that apparently had marigolds near the seeds.
20:38:15 And so just add water in this in the grow, so I had that plant on my floor and I just kept knocking it over every other day and I just like whatever, I'll leave it there and I was like wait.
20:38:26 I feel like almost a year I wonder if you still have season there. So I left it on my window sill thing. I added water.
20:38:35 And I didn't do well on the test. So went into my room I came to cry and just like pocket destroyed this test, but my little plant started growing, and I was like oh my god like after you like it actually grew like, what, so I have that but it can keep
20:38:50 me stupid plan on my phone the life.
20:38:54 Okay, the one on the phone is fake and it's just hope you track your water drinking.
20:39:01 Yeah.
20:39:03 But I, even though I have not been drinking my eight glasses of water.
20:39:22 I have been doing in like three or four Sundays I have had eight. But do they also have like three or four so I have definitely like brought up how much water I drink.
20:39:24 No, that's good.
20:39:27 And then you also had a walking goal right. Does it happen this week.
20:39:44 That did not happen.
20:39:36 I had for presentations do my students had a test. I had to test this week that did not happen this week.
20:39:44 Okay, no worries, no worries.
20:39:48 I'm going to log out of 10 one. That's all.
20:39:58 So with the fruit.
20:40:05 How, how did that go for you in terms of any feelings come up, like think I was annoying to feel.
20:40:12 I did feel more energetic so I felt more energetic I feel like, you know, but I think I was annoyed with the text messages where I was like, All right, good like I'll eat in a be like, folks over my like a no to eat, and then like at night, I was like,
20:40:28 oh shit i did not eat let me, let me do that now. When I will do it, you know. So they were helpful, they were very helpful, but like, one of them I got into test, I'm like do like why right now, or why am I getting this message right now I'm like daily
20:40:56 this test, you know, I don't know it's not your fault. It wasn't at that, like, after my test I was like okay now I can eat my fruit, you know, as it goes more goes off about my test than anything else.
20:40:57 Yeah, but they were very hopeful I enjoy getting the messages because like, even if I ignored it like it was still there bugging me like eat your food it's like, All right, let me my room, so sorry.
20:41:08 No one text message.
20:41:11 No, and they were helpful like it reminded me to eat, you know.
20:41:17 Oh, yeah. Okay, I'm gonna say okay so what do you want to share anything else about a gear. Your this last week's health goals.
20:41:34 What do you mean, yeah, I'm just like anything like if, for example, the fruit one like you, you feel like you've built the habit and will like consume more fruit, is that something that you feel happened or no.
20:41:52 Um, I think that happened with the water one, the fruit one, not so much.
20:41:59 But it's not because I don't want to. It's just because I have to make sure I go out there and buy you know like the water one like we have here every single day.
20:42:09 The fruit what like, you know like, I will buy a bunch of bananas, and it's like, at the end of the week like they're gonna have to go replace it no or even like strawberries or it just goes bad, you know, like my strawberry was all a bad.
20:42:24 Yeah, my strawberries all a bed.
20:42:27 After like three days or something you know, but it's like I ate the wall I had on there were there.
20:42:36 I'm the walking when they think I would have done it more.
20:42:40 Excuse me if I had more time. you know, I think it's also like taking time to build up the habit like I feel like after this week, and just how busy I was I just did not have time for me.
20:42:57 Okay.
20:43:00 Um, so let me circle back to the text messages like the daily ones that happened in the morning. I'm not the few reminders
20:43:10 about those messages stood out.
20:43:19 Or did any of them stand out. And did they motivate you in any way. I don't think I'm motivated by anything besides like seeing them they're like reminding me you know it's just like in your face like you did not eat like this message easier for you,
20:43:30 because if I don't read a like I'm not gonna open it and dismiss you know I will ignore it for now.
20:43:37 And so when I turn on my phone to see my notifications.
20:43:41 It's like you can't see well but it's like, oh, like, yeah, like, an hour ago you should have drink water, you know, so it was a with the fruit, you know like, Oh, you should be eating your fruit.
20:43:56 And so I was like, All right, like let me just do this now let me get it over with.
20:44:15 So was I gonna say, I'm
20:44:22 do so for you because I know you do have such a busy lifestyle. Do you look at them once a day or do you kind of like, let them accumulate and then like look through them.
20:44:34 I look at my messages like every day whenever I have time, it's horrible how much I'm on my phone.
20:44:42 My phone is like my biggest distraction. But if I like see it, and I have time then I will do it now. Okay.
20:45:00 Mike has happened like once a week or something.
20:45:05 It's okay, you can answer me too.
20:45:09 Huh. Hmm. Oh no no no I don't need
20:45:24 But, um, yeah, I like.
20:45:29 Look at my phone to look at my messages, most of the time that's all I use it for.
20:45:35 And I will like you know if I have time, I'll do it then in there if I don't, I'll like ignore it to do later.
20:45:42 Hmm. Okay.
20:45:47 Um,
20:45:59 I guess.
20:45:59 Going back to your health goals. Um, this is, sorry, am I freezing. No I hear you.
20:46:07 Okay.
20:46:07 Um, What would you like to focus on this week.
20:46:13 I'm definitely the water one. I feel like that's an important one to have,
20:46:21 um, I would like to work on Route one as well.
20:46:29 I don't know what else.
20:46:36 Yeah.
20:46:38 Okay.
20:46:41 So, for the water one, I'm in the next week. You will.
20:46:48 And how would you like me to phrase that for you.
20:46:51 And then next week.
20:46:55 I will continue to drink more than four glasses of water a day.
20:47:06 Um, in this upcoming week, I will eat fruit, at least twice a day, two servings of fruit, a day.
20:47:18 Yeah, I don't know what else.
20:47:34 OK, and then. So for the water one do you want to have it be for the whole week.
20:47:41 Yeah. Okay.
20:47:45 And we're talking like Sunday to Sunday for exam. Yes.
20:47:57 Then what about for the fruit one.
20:48:01 Same thing.
20:48:05 Cool.
20:48:06 And then, what's your confidence level and meeting your water goal.
20:48:12 I think it's like four glasses of water I'm like get a nine for confidence. Okay. And then the fruit one.
20:48:22 Also like an out of nine.
20:48:28 Um, so for either of them, what types of things.
20:48:35 Would you need to be successful in meeting your goal.
20:48:39 I'm gonna say no on the reminders. No, they're good they're good.
20:48:47 Maybe just one reminder a day. I think two or two is fine, as is just me just like I had to build up the habit, you know, there was like nothing wrong with you like texting me, it was just like me trying to build the habit and like stressing myself out
20:49:04 with other things. When it's like I could just eat a fruit to calm down, you know.
20:49:11 Do you want me to do that again, or pass.
20:49:16 Yeah, you could do it again.
20:49:18 Okay.
20:49:22 Um, do you want me to send them at different times though, rather than the times that we had it set, or sometimes those times are fine with me.
20:49:34 Okay.
20:49:38 Um, yeah, any anything else to the, the, you need to help you meet these goals. Maybe the app.
20:49:46 I'm not sure if you want to give that a try again or do you want to try another way of tracking the water goal. I'm going to use the app. Yeah.
20:49:56 Okay.
20:50:04 Um, let's see. And then
20:50:07 I guess if you could reshare the reasons why these goals are important to you.
20:50:15 Um, I like the drinking water goal just because I feel like that helps me cut out like tons of sugary drinks from my diet.
20:50:27 Like when I think about getting soda or something, it's automatically like no like I have water at home, you know like, especially if I like order in.
20:50:50 I'm same if I go out to eat somewhere like it's like No, I'll just have a water like it's fine.
20:50:45 I think with the food one. It's the same it's like helping you eat something healthy.
20:50:56 That like you normally like at least me I normally like wouldn't think about it.
20:51:04 I'm more of like, oh, like I will, you know, eat something else because I don't want to eat bro, but I feel like fruit is like very very healthy too.
20:51:15 So, yeah.
20:51:19 Cool.
20:51:21 Yeah.
20:51:26 Okay.
20:51:28 So I'm wondering
20:51:32 about, I think this is our fourth coaching session.
20:51:39 So, I'm essentially this is the last time that we meet.
20:51:46 Um, but we have one meeting left, but it won't be with me, it'll be with like another person, just to provide feedback about your experience.
20:52:00 Um, I want to be mindful of your time though. Do you want to meet. Do you want to meet with him next week or the week after, I'm not sure what your schedule is like me next week.
20:52:11 Okay. Um, Let me look up the calendar real quick.
20:52:20 Oh, Wendy when would be a good time for you next week.
20:52:24 I think that this time works best.
20:52:29 The 830. Yes, unless that's too late in the academic eight on a Wednesday.
20:52:38 Let me, which time do you prefer all.
20:52:44 I'll ask for both times and then.
20:52:47 But say that you prefer this, this time.
20:52:52 Um, I don't have a preference either or is fine.
20:52:55 Okay.
20:53:09 So for just to say a little more about that, you'll have.
20:53:14 So after today's session I'll send you an email like I normally do.
20:53:19 Do you need any additional resources, besides what I normally send.
20:53:25 No, I'm fine, thank you know of course.
20:53:28 And then, Um.
20:53:32 The other thing that you should expect from us as another survey, and the survey should be short like 50 like less than 15 minutes, and we ask that you complete that after or sorry, not after before, before the meeting on Thursday, and.
20:53:52 And hopefully, yeah I should be, it should be easy. I'll send you the Google invite tonight. Once I get someone to agree to meet with you.
20:54:04 But other than that, I am not sure if you have any other questions or if you want to just check in more about like all the things you have on your plate before signing off, because I feel like I'm getting like a sense that you have like a lot on your
20:54:20 plate, and you're like, when as.
20:54:22 Yeah, I don't know, I want to be here for you provide space. But yeah, I think I'm okay I think knowing that next week is the last week of like grad school, at least for this year like school year is great I mean I'm taking the summer class too.
20:54:43 But I feel like after this week, like, I will be more not stressed, I will like have afternoons to lay down and be lazy or have afternoons to go on walk was like my dogs and whatnot, you know, but I think right now it's just like how hectic and like how
20:55:01 much there was to do.
20:55:02 Yeah.
20:55:03 And it's, it's been tough to get through the semester, and still trying to be a responsible person. Yeah.
20:55:20 Um, are you taking classes in the fall.
20:55:14 Yes, I will be in the fall, USF. I think there's two classes, only that I need to take.
20:55:22 And then like two in the spring or something.
20:55:25 Cool. Um, I have one class, I USF too So, hopefully, we can like run into each other sometime.
20:55:33 Yeah. Very cool. Hopefully, yeah, hopefully, I don't know it might be difficult to see like what we look like with masks on
20:55:44 the way we may a little plan around just like, Do you recognize this plant, it's dead but do you recognize
20:55:51 me so funny.
20:55:55 cool.
20:55:56 Well, um, you're still Welcome to text me anytime if you want to do another check in.
20:56:11 Okay.
20:56:13 Well I hope you have a restful evening. What are you doing, I'm going to do a lesson plan, I just need to like, edit it and I'm basically done.
20:56:22 Okay, well, if you want just take a moment and shake it out stretch, get another cup of water before you get started and hit the ground running.
20:56:34 Um, I'll schedule those text message reminders, and you don't have any exams, coming up. Now, not right now.
20:56:44 Okay.
20:56:45 And, um,
20:56:48 no me or text me if you need anything.
