19:45:51 Hey, Mr. G.
19:45:56 Hey, it's weird because some zoom calls change it to like my name like Elizabeth Garcia.
19:46:12 Only because like Miss G and stuff and it's like, why
19:46:12 your hair.
19:46:15 How are you, good how are you.
19:46:20 I'm okay.
19:46:23 What does okay mean for you.
19:46:27 I'm just tired, I have like some assignment do today.
19:46:36 Our project due tomorrow, so I feel like I'm kind of stressing but I'm like okay like I'm not like in a rush to do things I just ordered food so I feel like evil I do homework.
19:46:49 Okay, well I'll definitely be mindful of your time, and we can just jump right into it, if that works out well.
19:47:02 Okay.
19:47:03 So, since you did kind of mentioned your stress I'll just hit that question first. On a scale of one to 10 What was your stress level this week.
19:47:17 I don't know if I'm like thinking about my stress level right now but he definitely like cried myself to sleep a few days ago.
19:47:25 I think it's, it's not like I'm not stressed I feel like I'm all like a three or four maybe at the very most, but I just felt very unmotivated. and they've been.
19:47:35 That's why I was like crying because it's like I've never been a student.
19:47:43 I know it's a very stressful time in the semester to.
19:47:49 So I can imagine, everything maybe feeling overwhelming, like you need a break because we do need a break.
19:48:04 Totally agree. I think that like I feel like I'm never really stressed about work
19:48:13 today, like yesterday like parents and kids were like just testing me and they could not.
19:48:21 Yeah.
19:48:23 The, the semester is winding down for your students to and parents might be freaking out about their grades and all of that stuff a lot of, I feel like teachers usually get a lot of or hold a lot of the responsibility and educating students when it's
19:48:42 more of a community effort.
19:48:54 Sorry, my, my internet has been really bad today so sorry if there's a small lag, or large leg.
19:49:02 And I think it's like everyone's a few of my classmates so like I'm going to turn my camera off because my internet.
19:49:13 Like, just mine but everybody.
19:49:30 Yeah.
19:49:21 Feel free to keep your camera off to see if it helps your connection.
19:49:28 So, let me go into the text messages and then we'll go into your health goals, what messages stood out.
19:49:36 Did any of them motivate you, any feedback.
19:49:41 Um, I think the one telling me to like take a break.
19:49:47 I literally looked at it and I was like, I guess I'm very, I'm going to go on the wall.
19:49:57 So, I'm cool.
19:49:58 Especially because it tells you what to take a break from you know like the computer as a TV you know I've been watching Netflix. I have been sitting on my screen the whole time and so it's like okay cool I need a break room electronics and needed a break
19:50:09 for like eyes. Yes.
19:50:13 Yeah.
19:50:14 Cool.
19:50:16 Any other comments on the text messages.
19:50:21 I'm the one about the proto definitely like made me crazy. so I went on a lot of strawberries.
19:50:28 But I think, among them neither, you know.
19:50:35 Cool. Yeah, that one I love that one.
19:50:39 It just reminds me so much of Mexico and like, I wish I could just go down the street and get something like that. Yeah.
19:50:57 Um, so then transitioning towards your health goals. How do you think you did in meeting your goals this week on a scale of one to 10.
19:51:08 It depends on the goals.
19:51:10 Okay, so tell you could tell me one by one. What are your thoughts. Um, I'm thinking about the one where I drink water, I need definitely drink more water than usual.
19:51:21 But it wasn't the eight cups that I wanted it was more of like three or four, three, until like my plant died one day and I was like,
19:51:37 Okay, I still have, like, a quarter left of my cup from before class, and then they just lay down like during class.
19:51:55 Um,
19:51:49 I took my dogs out for a walk.
19:51:55 I love my co workers know that I was going on a walk too. So I think the walk one was okay.
19:52:06 So, what, what would you say for that one on the scale of one to 10.
19:52:10 The last one was like a seven or eight.
19:52:14 I did not go twice a day but I made sure to go at least once.
19:52:24 And I think that's because I'm, like, my class and at 1215.
19:52:32 And they don't want to, like, eat breakfast to so I'll cook during my lunch to.
19:52:37 And so, no time for me to go on the walk until it's after three, so I made sure to go at three if I didn't go at all.
19:52:43 So the midday one was a struggle.
19:52:52 Yeah.
19:53:14 Well, can you tell me a little bit about.
19:53:14 Did you notice the positive and from either drinking or water or from taking those walks at 3pm.
19:53:14 More how's it
19:53:17 going on my.
19:53:20 I think the water one was more like a personal goal so I could like hydrate and all I got was having to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes.
19:53:33 Okay.
19:53:33 Um, I
19:53:36 can't.
19:53:38 I didn't hear what you said before, what do you say something about the walking goal. And then you happy it made me more positive before class.
19:53:47 Okay.
19:53:56 So, um, before, or what, what would you like to focus on this week for your health goals
19:54:06 or health goal we can stick to one no pressure to do more than that.
19:54:11 I think still kicking it out on on going on walks twice a day.
19:54:18 Together, get some kind of exercise and like my, my eyes away from the screen and stuff.
19:54:24 and
19:54:28 eating fruits, because I feel like since I stopped making that a goal like I have not.
19:54:34 Okay.
19:54:37 So for the first goal around walking, I know you said you had a challenge with the midday walk.
19:54:44 What's another time that would work for you to go for a walk.
19:54:51 I don't know, probably like after classroom this time now.
19:54:55 Maybe like 830 depending on my class. So I'm still trying to do the 12 one.
19:55:02 So, 1215 3pm 830 for backup.
19:55:21 And then, um, did we set these for 10 minutes each.
19:55:28 So what the walks how long you were walking for
19:55:35 15 minutes,
19:55:43 and then do you want to do this every day, or do you want to just have this goal for three days out of the week.
19:55:52 I think every day at least Monday through Friday.
19:56:00 Okay,
19:56:02 so let's see what, why is this goal important to you know walking one.
19:56:09 Yes, it gets me to look at something else besides my screen.
19:56:16 And it helps me realize like or not realize it helps me think about like taking care of myself and being active.
19:56:29 So on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting this goal.
19:56:37 I think like a 71, what, what do you need to help you meet this goal.
19:56:50 Probably to time manage
19:56:53 what what would that look like.
19:56:58 I'm.
19:57:01 I think it means like staying focused on class.
19:57:06 So I can leave class early.
19:57:11 Um, and be able to go on the walk, because if I don't understand the class I'll stay later on for tutoring and stuff.
19:57:21 And that like interrupt my time to go on the wall.
19:57:34 Is there anything that I can do to help you meet your walking goal know
19:57:47 anything you'd like to add about that goal specifically
19:57:54 know.
19:57:56 Let me just repeat it back to you and it says, and then next week you will go for 215 minute walks throughout the day, Monday through Friday, times, 1215 3pm and then 830 for backup.
19:58:13 I'm sorry. It's not a 30 it's like do end up at seven o'clock, or 730, either works fine.
19:58:22 You're there works fine. I'll just put some 34 backup. Okay, cool. And then for your second goal. It was to increase your servings of fruit.
19:58:32 Yes.
19:58:34 Can you say a little more in the next week, I will.
19:58:48 And then next week, I will make sure to eat fruit or vegetable, at least twice a day.
19:58:50 So, how many servings.
19:58:55 Two. Oh, I guess, yeah. Okay, that makes sense.
19:59:00 I'm thinking about it to like, wait, This is one big count as one survey.
19:59:05 Yeah.
19:59:07 I won't you one strawberry though, you know, two servings of fruit, each day.
19:59:14 There we go.
19:59:15 And then, is this a goal that you want to have every day three, four days of the week, Monday through Friday, what seems possible. Right.
19:59:25 Yeah. Okay.
19:59:28 And then do you have access to fruits.
19:59:33 Yes, I bought some strawberries recently.
19:59:36 Okay.
19:59:37 Um, any other things you have.
19:59:40 I also bought cuties the oranges the tangerine
19:59:49 is going to be enough for the next thursday friday five days, sorry.
19:59:58 That's okay. And we have oranges to.
20:00:03 I think I think so, um, I could always go out to buy more like in the week.
20:00:08 Okay.
20:00:08 Okay.
20:00:13 And then, why is this goal important to.
20:00:36 This call is important because it helps me eat healthier and stay healthy.
20:00:33 So on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal.
20:00:41 Okay, what, what are those challenges that you're anticipating.
20:00:49 I think just forgetting or not having time.
20:00:55 Yeah, maybe like it's easy you just reach over and like there's a free right there.
20:01:00 But I think because like my presentations I do this week and next week, I'm just gonna like free guy.
20:01:07 So you're anticipating like maybe not a high stress but like high stress.
20:01:14 But my prohibit. Okay.
20:01:19 Um, so what what it'd be helpful, like, I'll give you an example I had one participant who like had a goal around drinking water, and was like jasmine, it would be super helpful if you send me like random water reminders, like throughout the day.
20:01:39 Would it be helpful if I did that for you a fruit reminder.
20:01:46 Sure. Yeah.
20:01:51 Is there anything else that I can do to me, to help you meet your goal.
20:01:58 Um, I think just the text messages are fine.
20:02:01 Okay. Does that boost your confidence at all.
20:02:16 Yeah. What, what would you say it boosts your confidence level two. I think like a nine, like a nine or 10.
20:02:22 And then, do you feel like you want to text messages a day, or as one text message and though.
20:02:30 I think one should be enough.
20:02:31 Okay.
20:02:32 And the other thing is like your or not, or I guess, say this.
20:02:44 I misinterpreted it. But, oh no, did I freeze, I can. Did you want to eat like two servings of fruit at two different times of the day, or do you just like for example if you eat a serving of strawberries and an orange.
20:02:58 at the same time that like meet your goal.
20:03:01 I think twice a day like different times. So like maybe one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
20:03:09 Okay. Gotcha.
20:03:21 Sorry What did you say about one or two text message reminders.
20:03:29 Um, you could send it in like the morning for like the morning time when I should eat us through like the afternoon.
20:03:41 Okay.
20:03:42 And whatever good times.
20:03:45 I think I was like, do you want an eight o'clock.
20:03:48 For sorry.
20:03:50 That's okay.
20:03:52 I think anytime after nine.
20:03:57 And then for the afternoon.
20:04:00 I think anytime like after three.
20:04:05 Okay.
20:04:12 cool.
20:04:14 Um, do you have any other questions before we sign off.
20:04:21 Okay.
20:04:30 Um, so I'll email these to you.
