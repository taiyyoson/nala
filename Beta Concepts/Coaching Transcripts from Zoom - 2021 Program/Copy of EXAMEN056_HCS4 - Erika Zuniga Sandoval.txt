11:29:00 Good morning.
11:29:02 Hello, Maria. Can you hear me fine. Yes, I hear you
11:29:10 just weird I have a weird.
11:29:12 Okay.
11:29:14 From that home and I'm using their phones that are mine.
11:29:18 So it's different.
11:29:20 I found it.
11:29:24 How are you, good, just getting ready for it day have laundry, lots of little, you know, the errand stuff that they do.
11:29:34 But it's looking good. It's looking nice. Yeah, so today is, how are you today. How are things going.
11:29:42 Things are going pretty good.
11:29:45 I'm wrapping up my last final.
11:29:49 So, how was like, trying to get I tried my best to get as much done yesterday.
11:29:57 Because I was invited to a baptism.
11:30:01 So I was like I need to put in as much work as I can. And then I had agreed to go get a pedicure with my sister.
11:30:07 So I woke up like a 630, and I was like tackling the paper and then around like one issue was my appointment and then I could work on it, working on it for a little bit, then I was like okay that's enough.
11:30:20 So today I'm going to wrap it up, but my week was a one by pretty fascinating because I have so many assignments like I was just on my computer all day, every day so I'm, I'm pretty tired but come over, I just want to finish already.
11:30:36 And this final papers like killing me because it's a it's a case vignette vignette venue. And yet, I think it's been yet.
11:30:46 And the client is just so complex.
11:30:52 So I keep going back and forth about the diagnosis, but I'm just like, you know what, fuck it I'm over it.
11:30:58 So that's what's on my mind.
11:31:01 Yeah.
11:31:02 And I'm thinking maybe someone that has could have potentially multiple diagnoses.
11:31:05 Oh, for sure she does, she does.
11:31:10 Well I'm glad that you're able to find some time to meet today. And I'll keep it as concerned as possible because I know you have lots of things to do.
11:31:21 Today is our last session for the program itself. So towards the end of today, I'll tell you more about next steps and things to, to look for in your email list there's one more meeting and but it won't be with me it would be with a different person from
11:31:39 our research team.
11:31:42 I'll tell you more about that at the end.
11:31:57 I think for now I definitely want to hear how your goals one for the week I know you were going to be working on drinking more water and meditation. Huh, how did how did it go for the week.
11:31:59 So the meditation I ended up doing two out of three days.
11:32:05 Um, I think it really just has to do with the fact that it's finals week. So it was really overwhelming, the water, I did it.
11:32:13 Thursday.
11:32:14 When Wednesday Thursday.
11:32:18 Not Friday, and it was Tuesday to right.
11:32:23 I did three to five for that one you had said Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday.
11:32:31 Yeah, so I didn't Tuesday.
11:32:35 I feel like I did, Wednesday, Thursday I struggled Friday with no. So, which was so weird but I think it's just because I was like, literally on my desk and so I should have just filled out my big gallon but the thing is that my bathroom is still not
11:32:52 done. So I've been having to move along, because when they come to like keep working on it, they may hell annoys so like, I will go to my sisters I went to my friends to shower and it's just been like a lot of moving pieces I feel like if it wasn't for
11:33:07 those factors and like finals week. I honestly feel like I would have been able to do all that. But it's just been soon, too many moving pieces.
11:33:17 Yeah, you had yeah you had a lot of things that came up and yeah i mean when there's oftentimes there's like little things that come up right like this whole situation with the restroom and like you mentioned, there's also finals that is that you're taking
11:33:33 care of right now. So having not having a consistent place that you can be at can disrupt your overall schedule. Mm hmm.
11:33:43 And how would you say your stress level was This Week on a scale of one to 10.
11:33:49 One that stress and stress.
11:33:52 Um, I want to say seven because I was stressed, but I feel like I just kept telling myself like it'll work out like I feel like who's not stressed during finals week, but yeah like a six, seven, because I was just like, you know, I'm just going to get
11:34:12 the work done, instead of like dwelling on it and thinking about it so much. And also I was just a little bit more comfortable with asking people like Hey, is it okay if I shower your place or if I go to do work or your place.
11:34:23 So it's been like fucking what week three already.
11:34:26 These people need to hurry up. But for in terms of your goal and thinking about the progress that you weren't able to make this this week. How would you rate that progress on a scale of one to 10 from my when we started to know where the week just for
11:34:46 this week with the goals that you have this
11:34:50 I think is six.
11:34:53 Okay, because like I did it, much like I did, I feel like I went 5050, but like the intention was there but I just feel like I just, There's just too much going on,
11:35:09 hopefully things will get settled soon with the whole like restroom situation where you're, you're renting the place.
11:35:18 No, it's my parents place I live with them and.
11:35:33 So, the people that come to fix it work full time. And then they come for like one hour after they work and they don't always come and I was telling my parents like, why did you guys contracts on one like that like just about Tim should have been done
11:35:38 like in a weekend.
11:35:43 He said my sister ability Angela there is a very old house, so they had to take all that, oh and then replace it. So, yeah.
11:35:55 Some personas get this different media or no say is that way they. It's like a fear like from my sister in law my sister in law was the one that was like oh I know, I know someone who does it but I thought it was going to be like, going through contract
11:36:11 or it's like they're dedicating their whole day to this, and it's like they come from work for like one hour and then they did and it's like my bathrooms tiny so it's three of them but like, only one can be working on at the same at the, at a time.
11:36:27 Right now.
11:36:43 want to be at the house much because I have, like, personal conflict with my mom so I might literally from house to house.
11:37:04 And it's a difficult situation with the bathroom and then also the home dynamics.
11:37:03 When you do you feel that you have like you mention family or friends that are like open and willing to let you like use the restroom or hang out at their place so that you can do your work.
11:37:14 Yeah, definitely. Yeah, but all my family members have a lot of younger kids. So it's really hard, especially like you know because I have my own therapy sessions with my clients and so it's difficult to have a quiet space.
11:37:32 But I mean, I'm, I'm dealing with it. Like, I, I'm surviving somehow.
11:37:40 We'll find ways to somehow survived. Yeah resilience.
11:37:46 So what it, what are you hoping to check in about today, or what do you want to focus on and thank you Matt today is our session, or and thinking ahead, like what are some of the things you want to continue to work on.
11:38:01 I think I really like that.
11:38:04 The little video that you sent me with the little heart shouldn't be remember. Yeah, that was like super cute I watched it all over a couple of times because I feel like it was a really good visual, how to interpret a healthy meal and I think often like
11:38:20 I get very big you have a weird relationship with food we're either like really indulge or like really like tell myself oh my god you shouldn't. And so that video really made me feel a little bit better.
11:38:35 Because even includes like authority yeah like it's very realistic to my life. So I really liked that video and I feel like moving forward I want to continue to like have that perspective when I, you know, when I'm eating.
11:38:49 Mike it's okay to have even you know Mexican meals, but being mindful of the portions on the plate, because before I always think portions. Now think okay like tiny amount but it's more like this percentage of that this percentage of that.
11:39:14 And I've never understood that and so
11:39:13 I I liked the video I wasn't sure if it was too.
11:39:18 If it was meant for like a younger audience but I liked it I'm like oh my god this is the cutest thing I've seen. Young.
11:39:28 Yeah.
11:39:28 I had the feeling that it was intended towards like Latino population because of the fear, and so many other examples that they use. So my god Okay, let's, let's see, for sure.
11:39:42 So feel free to share that with anyone that you think might find it also useful. Yes, yes.
11:39:49 So in thinking about some of the activities that we've done and just skills that we've reviewed. What are some of the skills that you feel that you'll, you'll be able to continue using moving forward with this think overall just having a balance because
11:40:29 So I think just, I learned to this to really be kind to myself and to really celebrate my, my small accomplishments because I do tend to be really hard on myself.
11:40:38 So like, even like this week's goals like To me it would have like it sounded very like basic and minimal. And yeah, I still couldn't achieve it because of sort of so much that's going on in my life you know and so I feel like in another time I would
11:40:53 have probably been like oh my god like disappointed like really, but now I'm just like, I got a lot of shit going on.
11:41:02 The next week is a new week so yes, I think you You said it yourself. Every, every week, every day is another opportunity to sort of reset and being aware of that it's important.
11:41:20 So what would you say were some of your successes during the program. So
11:41:29 I think the meal prepping I hadn't done in a long time. even though like I didn't eat all of the meals like I feel like it kind of reminded me like the meal prepping is not that bad, because I kind of like really dread it.
11:41:45 So, it just really reminded me to like it's okay to take baby steps towards what you want. You know, I feel like moving forward I, I probably will do that to stay on track but definitely learn to mix up my plates.
11:42:04 And you know the portion aspects of it too.
11:42:09 And I know you mentioned a little bit about challenges, which were like that. There's a lot going on at this moment. Is there any other challenges that you want to discuss, maybe we could do some problem solving around it, or how can you think ahead so
11:42:28 that next time, a challenge comes up you're able to problem solve, or addressing, or I think, I think it's just like planning ahead for me, like knowing that there's a lot of movement in my life right now like it's important to just put in the head.
11:42:48 So for example like in the mornings fill out because I have a gal and I was very consistent with our like first two weeks, pretty much.
11:42:59 So, I feel like doing something like that, obviously, meal prepping my breakfast and lunch.
11:43:06 So just like planning ahead, like putting on my calendar when I'm going to meditate or, you know, things like that.
11:43:16 Because I feel like it's the inconsistency in my life right now that's making it really difficult to write you know like that truly be able to be like okay it's time to drink water.
11:43:41 Whereas if I would have planned it and fell down my whole gallon it would have been sitting there so like right on my desk.
11:43:38 Now I fully agree. Yeah, those, those things can really throw everything off.
11:43:43 Yeah.
11:43:47 I think you have a good sense of, sort of, where you want to move towards and the way it's required of you to do that, like you mentioned the planning.
11:43:59 It's going to be helpful. Using a calendar can be helpful to have those reminders.
11:44:04 But I think also that you mentioned earlier to just being kind to yourself whenever a challenge comes up and know that every week, can be a new start.
11:44:16 So, yeah.
11:44:18 Very good.
11:44:21 So in today's session we do set some smart goals, if you if you want to, or, you know, the following week or depending on where you want to continue moving towards.
11:44:35 So are there specific SMART goals that you want to set for this week, or continue with last week's.
11:44:41 What are you thinking might be the best next step for you now.
11:44:46 Yeah, I do want to set some goals since this is.
11:44:53 I think I want to keep it the same as last week's to try it again.
11:45:00 So we have meditation and drinking more water. Uh huh.
11:45:05 Are you thinking the same amount of water.
11:45:08 Yeah.
11:45:09 And the same 10 minutes of meditation for three days.
11:45:13 At least Yeah.
11:45:22 And how confident, do you feel about being able to do the meditation for example, I'm going to say at nine.
11:45:33 And how about drinking more water, a nine to
11:45:47 think those are very good goals to continue and move forward, because it's something that you, that you've really been wanting to work on. So, we are in a very good place there, and other questions that Oh wait,
11:46:05 I always forget to go back to the top of my form any messages this week that sort of stood out to you made you think about, you know, okay, I might want to do that or just brought some thoughts to my about your health and wellness.
11:46:31 Um,
11:46:31 I think the one that was like something about having fun and singing.
11:46:37 I forgot exactly the words but it was like that one stood out to me the most because like, it's just like the most regular activities, you know to mean like, I think we focus so much on like this, Eurocentric perspective of like what it's like to be healthy,
11:46:57 and there's so much more to it than just dieting and exercising it's like live your freakin life read a book, damn thing.
11:47:08 Yeah, so I think that one stood out to me the most.
11:47:35 Any, any other messages that you have during the week.
11:47:25 remember any others,
11:47:30 to be honest.
11:47:35 There's been lots of text messages coming through.
11:47:38 I did, I did want to send you a quote because I know you had asked about quotes or just motivational ideas throughout the week. And I think I did just a few days, because I was trying to figure out how to use the platform because usually add on set.
11:47:58 The messages. We have a team that sets the messages. But I think I was able to do a few days so hopefully you found most useful. Yeah, there was a cool, though, talked about making yourself a priority and believing in yourself.
11:48:13 I really like to make yourself a priority because I feel like I still struggle with that.
11:48:17 Yeah, I was trying to figure out what are some good ones and I mean I feel that one even for me I can completely identify with, with that. Yeah,
11:48:31 sometimes as as women we want to help others and then we forget okay but I also need to take care of myself.
11:48:45 And you will be receiving a few a few more messages I believe.
11:48:52 Actually, I think they end up today. Now that I think about it because I think you should have received that thank you for participating. To little icon.
11:49:03 Today, um I think you oh yeah good assets are two participants here. Yeah.
11:49:09 So today is the last day of your text messages to.
11:49:12 Okay.
11:49:14 And do you have any other questions for me.
11:49:21 No, There's the last time will be meeting right until somebody else.
11:49:24 Well thank you for your support. I really appreciate you and your team for doing this. I think it was really hard for me to maintain it, but I wanted to really just give it a try and see you know what I gained from it, I did learn a lot so I appreciate
11:49:38 you.
11:49:40 Thank you. Thank you.
11:49:41 And I think you've said, Great goals for yourself every week. Those are things that are important to you and just remember that you set goals. I'll send you the little template for SMART goal setting just to have that as a reminder, because like you said,
11:49:58 You know, sometimes it's those baby steps and yes the first step, can be the hardest. But if we make it achievable, then it can push us to continue to be able to do things.
11:50:08 Okay, so for for next steps. As I mentioned, you are have received all the text messages by now.
11:50:18 I am going to be sending you a link to like a post survey by the end of today. It's similar to the server you've completed at the beginning but it should only take about 15 minutes this time around maybe not the full 20 or half an hour, because the other
11:50:37 way too low.
11:50:37 But we needed more information from you then.
11:50:41 more information from you then. Once you complete the survey. Then we're going to invite you to meet with one of my examined colleagues to do just a few more questions and more about your experience and get your feedback on how we can improve the program.
11:50:56 This meeting is typically like 40 minutes or so. And we have been trying to schedule those around the same time that you meet with me. However, we just need to really know when you're available and then I can look at who's available from the team so they
11:51:13 can meet with you to give me a few dates, I can check with them, and then I can confirm what what day that will be. How does that sound.
11:51:26 So I tell you, and then the day confirm. Yeah, so if you give me maybe at least two options. That way, I can check with multiple people cuz it will either be Dr Lingle my our, our advisor for the program, or one of our cohort members, which was Susan,
11:51:45 but it will be someone that did not do the health coaching with you so it will not be me.
11:51:51 Okay, I think this Monday works tomorrow.
11:51:58 Monday.
11:52:00 Are you thinking in the evening, morning in the morning.
11:52:22 That might be really soon, but I can ask them today. Oh, actually we could do Tuesday. Tuesday.
11:52:13 Tuesday, Wednesday at nine.
11:52:17 My name. Huh. Okay.
11:52:21 So it is important that you do the survey before Tuesday.
11:52:26 So what I'll do is actually after I'm done with our meeting, I'll send you the link. That way you have today and tomorrow to complete it.
11:52:34 Okay. Okay.
11:52:42 Is there another time just in case Tuesday, 9am, they're not alone. Yeah.
11:52:49 Wednesday.
11:52:51 Wednesday at 1pm. Okay.
11:52:56 Yeah, sure. Let's do Wednesday instead. Okay, instead of tuesday wednesday at one or Thursday at 12.
11:53:05 So Wednesday at one or Thursday at 12.
11:53:11 I think the one in the top might be better times because usually they, their afternoons are more available or they could do like a lunchtime.
11:53:19 Okay, perfect. And so I will, I will send you a summary email, of the, what the goals that you set for yourself. And I'll include on there. The, the date that that the interview will be scheduled for, so I'll go with that first and that way I can let
11:53:37 you know as I remember once you complete the survey then we'll invite you will send you the calendar invite.
11:53:44 Okay.
11:53:47 See, any questions that you have for me. No, no questions.
11:53:54 Well I really want to thank you for participating arm I know that it's. You have a lot going on in life and this. This time I hope was very helpful and useful to help you move forward in the goals that you want to achieve.
11:54:08 remember that it's important to take care of ourselves, just like you mentioned that self care is important and to be gentle with ourselves because we tend to take on a lot at time.
11:54:18 And by taking care of ourselves, we're better able to take care of others as well so it's very important to always remember in it Giuliana, we're almost there.
11:54:28 Yes.
