17:58:11 Start with. How was your goal during the week. How did you do.
17:58:16 Okay.
17:58:21 So, sometimes.
17:58:28 So okay, my goal was the walking meditation and then maybe that take out I think you want it to do two days. So far the ticket thing has been going good.
17:58:41 Um, yes.
17:58:41 And so like for the busy days I've been doing the something I can make ahead of time or whatever it's like yesterday we have this Anya, for dinner because that's something that can make.
17:58:52 Earlier in the day, or just put together really fast.
17:59:02 And then, but I have forgotten to do it on the walk and so I'll just do in meditation later that day.
17:59:10 So that's been going okay.
17:59:15 Um, I just feel like I not
17:59:24 like the, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it like it's like is not feeling like the same benefit that I wanted. I guess to feel from it. Um, and I don't know if that's just because of, like, the difference between the walking meditation versus
17:59:38 just doing it, sitting, or if it's like, just trying to fit it in the day, rather than having a set time for it.
17:59:49 I don't know.
17:59:52 Did you notice a difference between the walking versus the sitting.
17:59:58 Yeah, I feel like sitting I felt more refresh. Afterwards, that I did with the walking like The Walking was nice, in the way that it helps like center myself and like kind of get grounded.
18:00:15 But I have noticed this week that I've been very, having very high stress levels, because I'm not necessarily sure why I don't know if it's just a combination of this being the last full week of school.
18:00:30 Just because, like my body's stress response is just to kind of shut down.
18:00:37 So like I get really really tired for no reason, and doesn't matter how much I sleep I'm still exhausted on the falling asleep, like on Tuesday, I ended up I slept a full night.
18:00:51 You know, at least at least like six to seven hours, and I got up and I made myself breakfast and I fell asleep after breakfast on the couch. And then I got up and then I like lay down on my bed and I fell asleep again until like right before class at
18:01:07 11, so it was just, yeah I just noticed that my stress level is really really high.
18:01:14 On a scale of one to 10 What would you say was your stress level, or, or last week.
18:01:23 Probably an eight or nine. Yeah.
18:01:29 Yeah. And then I think unit you're very aware of how the type of body responses that you have. Because yes, even though you had a full night's sleep your body was still telling you, you, your, your mind might be working like over time.
18:01:49 I just need more rest, pick that up after, you know, being in school for so long just, I end up and and I guess that's part of the reason why really wants to learn good coping mechanisms for stress and feeling overwhelmed just because I'll tend to like
18:02:05 my body like starts to shut down and I like I get really tired at first and I'll just be really sleepy all the time like right now I want to go take a nap and then after that, if the stresses and go down and I think because it's just stress lowers your
18:02:20 immune system I get sick.
18:02:23 Then I'm sick for, you know, a few days, and then it makes me more stress because I can't afford to be sick because I have stuff I need to do.
18:02:31 Yeah, it's sort of just delete everything else that you need to get done.
18:02:36 So in terms of them, you are you're hoping that meditation was going to help you to be able to manage some of that.
18:02:43 And you found that it could be that one version versus the other was actually more beneficial.
18:02:50 Are you finding that the city meditation is just is requiring too much time and that way you feel that you're more, more likely just fitting it in wherever you can.
18:03:00 And that's why you don't see a benefit, I guess I just don't set the time aside for like consistently like I guess I should like I tell myself, I'll do it.
18:03:16 After lunch, you know like, I'll meditate after lunch right after it it'll be good because between classes will feel refreshed and not have like that afternoon.
18:03:40 Drag and I'll end up eating lunch, because I prioritize.
18:03:31 Walking Luna, or working out over, or over meditating is all work out and then I'll only have like an hour or so or 45 minutes before my next class and so by the time I'm done eating like
18:03:50 there's not much time before class and so then I can't really feel like I can relax because I'm just thinking of our class being in like 15 minutes, you know,
18:04:06 is there a different time of the day that you, you feel you there's more flexibility, where it could be done or you want to do it in the afternoon but that's also when the time you have more activities going on.
18:04:19 Yeah, I was thinking about maybe trying this week to maybe do it right after classes are out
18:04:29 to reset. Yeah, to kind of reset. Those are the only other thing I could take a try. There's like a few points in the day that I could see myself, starting the habit, hopefully, which would be either like right when I wake up fresh after breakfast after
18:04:44 lunch or.
18:04:48 So for I guess so breakfast slash when I wake up.
18:04:53 After lunch, after classes or before bed before bed. I tried once this week it was okay.
18:05:06 I haven't done one in the morning, yet.
18:05:09 And then,
18:05:13 And then after lunch I just,
18:05:17 it's I don't fit it in I'll give myself enough time to so the really the other ones has been like, somewhere in the evening, after class and then, or when I walk or read before bed at one time.
18:05:33 And now the times that you did do it this last week, because you were able to still do the meditation I think we're just trying to figure out how do you get, how do you find a time that it's actually giving you the most benefit that you wanted to give
18:05:48 you that time so you were able to do it last week was there a time that you felt. If I could do it more regularly at this time. It would make a difference.
18:05:59 I want to do it in the afternoon. That would be the best because that's when I get really tired and so I'll get a snack or I'll drink tea or sometimes coffee if I'm really desperate.
18:06:14 You know something to just it help like to I tried it today, where I meditated after my class. And I had I'm on the board for the moot court program and so we're interviewing applicants for next year and so I had 20 minutes between class getting out and
18:06:33 the moot court stuff. And so I did just like a 10 minute meditation on YouTube. I actually felt really good afterwards like I felt refresh I'm tired again now, but it helped at least for a little while.
18:06:50 So, I would like to do it in the afternoon to kind of beat that afternoon late afternoon to evening drag so I was listening like right after classes wouldn't be too bad, just because I'm also doing
18:07:04 a kind of a studying goal to kind of help my stress levels as well so I'm not so overwhelmed and just doing an hour of studying for finals, a night and I've started this like earlier this month so I had a whole month before finals so I could just do,
18:07:21 you know, an hour maybe, maybe more depending on maybe two depending on how I'm feeling that day. And that way, I'm not putting it off until last minute but this past week, specifically from like last Friday.
18:07:47 I've been just dragging. And so by the time like I'm going to do my study because I do it late at night. Um, I just I can't even I don't feel like I'm learning the material or reviewing the material like I want to because I'm just so ready to sleep.
18:07:56 Yeah, you're tired by that time for being able to concentrate and staying motivated in this subject is. It's a little bit more difficult by then. But I was doing buying up until like last Friday and so that's what I that's kind of how I'm like okay this
18:08:21 And, and I mean, there's, there's different.
18:08:25 Your body's definitely tell you that there's, there's something that's reaching its max right and something needs to happen to. So to release some of that.
18:08:38 However, just remember that we don't want the meditation to also become a stressor in your life, right, because then you're going to hell it up a little more.
18:08:48 But if you found that the afternoon was the best time I think it's worth another shot and see how it goes this week. Okay.
18:08:57 So, how many, how long have you been meditating, or how long do you want to meditate, or in the afternoon.
18:09:11 So they give you like a small goal like 10 minutes. Yeah, bf unable to find like two minute meditations by minute meditations on YouTube. So it could be any amount of time that you think okay I can dedicate this to it.
18:09:23 I think 10 minutes is like the right amount, cuz I do, I guess I technically do meditate.
18:09:30 Most days, because I do a short meditation after a workout.
18:09:35 But it's only like a two to three minute thing and it's just relaxing.
18:09:42 But I don't really count that I know
18:09:48 it can be it can be that good pile, editing it up at the end of the day. And so we're saying 10 minutes in the afternoon, how many days this upcoming week.
18:10:01 Let's share for
18:10:04 five seems too
18:10:09 much of a of an extreme goal or days is a very good place to start.
18:10:16 Yeah, usually I would say three to four is a good. It's a good range. So, thank you. You're very good.
18:10:24 So you mentioned that you, you will go on YouTube and find videos, are there other resources that you use to help you remember to do it, or what are some of the steps that you take to remind yourself to do this.
18:10:39 Nothing I haven't, so maybe that's one of the other problems I haven't done anything to remind myself.
18:10:46 Is there something that you use every day that can remind you, or set a reminder on your phone. Follow set a reminder on my phone. That's why I was kind of like saying things that my day is centered around like meals or right after class like you know
18:11:01 what know that right after class it's time to meditate. So that was the only. That was kind of my way of reminding myself but maybe an alarm on my phone would be better.
18:11:12 Yeah.
18:11:24 Okay, you schedule this. Now, let's do it.
18:11:28 I mean if you've heard
18:11:32 any other suggestions for handling stress, I'm totally open side from journaling I don't do journaling I can. No, I think some other ways is that there's common is definitely like meditation or exercise, which you do an exercise in moderation should be
18:11:52 be helping you release stress exercise and excess can actually cause stress to your body.
18:11:58 So we want to make sure that there's a balance.
18:12:09 So continued with the locks I think the locks are great, the locks will keep you safe.
18:12:19 The meditation I think meditation, we could give it a try
18:12:28 Two Minute days.
18:12:33 And how confident, do you feel about being able to achieve this. I'm like a seven.
18:12:45 And I think when we start.
18:12:47 It's something that you started and you're able to do.
18:12:51 I think as soon as you start to see more of the benefits of it, it'll keep you motivated to, to continue then, and we also sometimes say that you need to give something, at least, like a two week trial before you notice, somewhat of a difference, or if
18:13:10 it's actually something that that's helping you.
18:13:14 When you are doing the meditation, are you doing more guided meditation just sound. Are you doing a body scan guided release for now. Yeah.
18:13:27 I have been silent, or like the sounds in the past like months ago.
18:13:35 And that was fine. I tend to find myself more
18:13:43 in the present I guess because the point of the meditation is to be in the present and find myself able to achieve that kind of a feeling a lot better when it's guided, because there's something to focus on rather than just being inside my own brain.
18:14:09 And that guided is, is it about a place at it, it sends you to or is it like more of a body scan to like does it guide you through your body so that you sense where you're having any tension or anything like I've done those before yeah I don't honestly
18:14:19 I don't even remember what was the one today I know today was one that was supposed to help with anxiety I do it did address some things like really some tensions like.
18:14:30 Don't throw your browser, relax your jaw, that kind of thing. Oh, yeah.
18:14:34 That's a little bit of about back body scanning. Okay.
18:14:41 Just give me an idea of maybe there's maybe it has to also do with what is being covered in the guided itself like the description of it the script of it can also make it make a difference.
18:14:56 I tend to do really well with mantras, I've noticed, having some kind of mantra to kind of stay inside my head.
18:15:07 During the meditation because that also like I said something to kind of hold on to.
18:15:14 Okay.
18:15:17 I'll look up a few and send you someone this email.
18:15:23 I always listen to them just to make sure like is this something that I would do,
18:15:31 which sometimes makes it a little hard because if I don't like their voice. Yeah.
18:15:38 Anyone else let's continue this.
18:15:54 Okay, so we have one goal in that's a very good one for this week. Anything else that you wanted to talk about this week. Other things that might have come up any challenge, other challenges that you're having you mentioned that you're realizing the stress
18:15:59 is causing you quite a bit of fatigue.
18:16:03 But any other things you notice
18:16:16 most the main one is just fatigue.
18:16:14 And I hate it because it happens to me every like every time I get really stressed out
18:16:23 because my sister has insomnia, so I'm like I have the opposite problem where I can't stop sleep.
18:16:31 And it also seems that, because you have been doing well but eventually when you get to this stress point, it kind of shuts you down like okay hard stuff where he said, Yeah, but you're wanting to learn how to avoid that.
18:16:49 So that you can just have a smooth transition throughout and manage along the way. Yeah.
18:17:00 Any successes that you have this last week.
18:17:07 So I decided to kind of plan out.
18:17:12 This week's meals, not necessarily meal prepping but just like knowing what I'm going to make so that it's, I know ahead of time and then there's not any kind of like guesswork or just like not having this stuff here so then things kind of get ruined
18:17:30 so that actually helped quite a bit because I was able to do.
18:17:34 Get all the groceries for this week, knowing what I was going to be making for dinner. So that was actually worked out really well.
18:17:42 The only bad thing was is that with the lasagna had to do that one last minute, I thought I have lasagna noodles and it turned out the expired a year ago.
18:17:53 It was like I was opening all these boxes, and they had like a holes in them because there was like a bug and I got in it and like started eating the noodles.
18:18:02 And like all of the box, I was like oh my god and the bad thing was she is because expired last January, and we have moved last August, so we moved houses with a bad news.
18:18:13 And little animals and your window started right you don't really know, at some point, It's disgusting.
18:18:27 And now,
18:18:27 Now, I'm getting the noodles and it worked out just fine. Oh, and then I was proud of myself because I was able to kind of sneak in a like vegetables into the dish like I put mixed spinach in with the meat, which I'd never done before and it turned out
18:18:44 really good like just putting in the spinach in there.
18:18:50 And that that's a great way to add a vegetable. Yes, so she sometimes when you don't even notice it's there.
18:18:57 And if you do and it's good then, the better.
18:19:02 So you're also trying new things with food.
18:19:08 Learning new ways to include fruits and vegetables.
18:19:11 I saw your suggestion about the mango with him.
18:19:18 And, yeah, that's, that's great. I think that's a popular one and my family.
18:19:22 I know there's a few fans of time we haven't tried it and I don't know why.
18:19:34 Oh my god, you have to, so good.
18:19:34 I imagine that it's sweet It's a sweet, or is it spicy, like both like the best of both worlds. It's so good. There's a. I was sad because getting that text I was like dang that sounds so good and there's this lady Could I live in, I don't know if you're
18:19:48 familiar with the Northway at all.
18:20:10 Okay, well there's this one neighborhood in center fails, the canal district and that's where I live and it's a largely
18:20:04 Latino community, lot of immigrants live here.
18:20:09 So there's always like little, there's always vendors going around it's like this department that oh man and then there's this lady that always has the Mongols with the joy and the Tachyon and I was like man I'm not one of those now and so I was gonna
18:20:21 go get one and there was so sad.
18:20:27 And we have.
18:20:30 I mean I live in San Jose and we have, we have quite a few that around but I don't think I've looked for it specifically. I know there's this area on Eastern also that sells ice cream and sometimes I go and get my screen but I've noticed they sell fruit
18:20:48 related items and I think that's one of the things they put on it, but I always thought that it was more of.
18:20:58 I don't know if I said it was just more like sweet, rather than spicy. So I think I stayed away from it for that really to try it I used to get it from the Bluegrass down in San Jose all the time.
18:21:09 Okay. I will add it to my list to try my guess I'll try it. I definitely love him.
18:21:19 He not so good.
18:21:22 Maybe there's this little online, small business that I ended up buying candy from for my partner for Christmas. And she makes like jumbo candy like she made puts like Skittles and joy in other can use to skills like the best one that's thinking of it,
18:21:42 but it was really good.
18:21:45 is really good. I think it was called the chum way queen is what it was and she does other ones too like the like the sour dummies.
18:21:54 And it's really good I know it's not that healthy and this is a health coach session is really good.
18:22:08 One anything that ever scientists are that we talk about sometimes is how, how do we enjoy the things that we like but we maybe have to switch it up a little bit right, or maybe yes we have them but we have them in smaller quantities right we don't have
18:22:16 buckets of gummy bears covered and enjoy.
18:22:29 It's delicious. I think especially coming from where we come from and how we grow up and the things that we grew up with. We need to keep that somehow but learn how do we do it in the, in the healthy way in moderation.
18:22:37 And how do we do it in moderation.
18:22:41 And how do we do it in moderation, so that it's something that we can continue to enjoy. Because they bring they bring those memories to us and I think those are important, important aspects to remember about our lives to
18:22:55 any other messages that stood out to you this week. I'm not off the top of my head, I'd have to look, but I liked that one I like the one today to That was cute the for the fruit and stuff.
18:23:19 coffee and it was literally drinking a nice coffee as I got the text message I was like, That's funny.
18:23:23 I really liked the keeping the, the fruit caps on hand.
18:23:29 So you can just take it up at the fridge I mean I usually keep fruit in the fridge but just having it already ready to go. I like that, just because it's easier.
18:23:39 I was feeling better at last Friday's text because it's a great sleep has many benefits, and I was like, No.
18:23:48 Really fatigued, because like more sleep does not make me feel better.
18:23:54 Oh nice actually. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, yeah, but no overall I like I like the text messages this week they were cute. I like the fruit cup idea and I liked the today's want to it's going to text back and say, if you freeze, great.
18:24:10 cold summer snacks. Yeah, sometimes I do those and the blueberries because they feel and what they, They make me think that I'm having ice cream.
18:24:22 But if it's a fruit that's just frozen.
18:24:37 And my dad and I used to do this back before, I will like I got my lactose kind of issue but you poor, and I haven't tried it with something else like a melt substitute. but if you put heavy cream on frozen blueberries it turns into like an ice cream
18:24:43 fruit, kind of a snack and it's lower calorie because you're not using that much milk it's just a little bit, and it's really really good so if you want to.
18:24:50 If you're not lactose sensitive I highly suggest it's very creamy and delicious. Oh, Yeah, that sounds really good. I've had frozen fruit with yogurt sometimes and when you do frozen fruit, it turns the yogurt and make the whole thing.
18:25:09 So a little bit like what you just described it reminded me of that so.
18:25:16 Yeah, but I have not tried the heavy cream. So, that's another option so used to do because growing up, my parents were on the Atkins diet for quite some time.
18:25:27 So that's what he would do for a dessert, because he wouldn't add any sugar or anything to it it was just the berry frozen berries, and then he would just pour a little bit of cream on it and it would make like this like Berry, ice cream, kind of a thing
18:25:43 it's really, it's very creative and if you think about it, it's you know exactly what ingredients you're adding to it, there's no additive of any kind, or added sugars like you will find in a lot of the ice cream, that's process them very, very healthier
18:25:57 alternative.
18:26:01 Any other questions that you might have for me today.
18:26:08 Um, no. Not unless you have any tips on keeping my energy up.
18:26:14 Then the other than trying out the meditation stuff.
18:26:19 I think I would I would definitely say just look at the things in your, your day I mean to me it sounds like you're very good about finding your schedule Chris you, you have school, and you plan out when you're going to study, but also apply now some
18:26:35 times in between. And I think your body telling you. Hey, stop might be a way of that it's telling you, hey, I need you to plan out some rest. Throughout the day, so that over time.
18:26:51 You don't have this excitement over exhaustion because there hasn't been enough breaks in between activities or in between assignments that you're doing.
18:27:01 And now, your brain is just feeling all this exhausted from it.
18:27:06 So something to think about. Maybe that can be the other goal is you have what 15 minutes to have at least 115 minute break.
18:27:20 five days a week during school
18:27:26 in between classes, it's not after process between classes
18:27:31 and doing something that's just for you, not using those 15 minutes to. Now let me do something else that I need to do because I need to be productive right just 15 minutes for for you.
18:27:49 How many days this week, did you wanna do that. Let's do five
18:27:58 classes, well for actually cuz I only have classes, four days a week.
18:28:05 And how confident, do you feel about being able to do that.
18:28:10 Because like an eight. Yeah.
18:28:15 I think sometimes we forget and it's actually something that we even talk about when someone has for example breathing issues or trouble breathing, and they want to walk.
18:28:25 We really encourage the idea of walk for a minute stop for a minute. Right, so it's a similar idea when you're thinking of your day and all the activities that you want to get done.
18:28:37 Yes, you want to get them done as soon as possible, but that's going to exhaust you a lot more. So if you break up your activities, and you add some rest time in between, you're going to be able to do a lot more.
18:28:50 Yeah.
18:28:57 And in thinking about that.
18:28:59 It will help you not just to do more throughout one day but throughout the week throughout the month, and hopefully avoid the episodes that you're experiencing right now you're feeling so tired and I just want to speed this horrible I hate it drives me
18:29:17 nuts.
18:29:19 When I get a migraine.
18:29:23 Okay, so I'm coming on I gotta go take some my girlfriend. Yeah.
18:29:28 and definitely do.
18:29:30 When it comes to pain, it's a lot easier to stop a little bit of pain than not a great deal of pain, right. So, take it as soon as you feel the pain, because that's actually good will stop you from taking more medication later over time.
18:29:45 Yeah, I think so. I think this will be good because now I feel like my body shutting down or getting like the fatigue like I saying is just my body's way of saying like you're not stopping for me so I'm going to make you stop.
18:29:59 Yes, yes it is.
18:30:02 So we have a second someone's on my tour.
18:30:37 Okay, guys.
18:30:40 Well, we're almost at the end. And what I will do is, I'll send you a summary email with the two goals that you want to work on for this week. Okay.
18:30:58 And then we'll check in, or we do need to set up our next meeting. Yes.
18:30:59 We can just keep Wednesday, that's fine. when things are working.
18:31:04 Yeah, let's keep it consistent okay so Wednesday at six. Yeah.
18:31:11 And that will be, will not be our last one. I think it will know mission for. Okay, so on session for our let you know more about what's coming up next.
18:31:23 And, and then we'll go from there. Wow, time flies by.
18:31:28 Yeah, then a month now.
18:31:49 Yeah.
18:31:59 but I did find that at least so far very helpful especially like with stuff that, like for instance with like
18:32:09 the meditation set like that's something that I've been wanting to do for a while and I just haven't been able to and so having someone help me come up with more attainable goals to be able to do it has been very, very good, very helpful, makes it seem
18:32:24 not so big.
18:32:27 Yeah. Yeah.
18:32:29 And that's the idea of using those SMART goals, using the the tenable doable goals, and that you can set up to do on a weekly basis.
