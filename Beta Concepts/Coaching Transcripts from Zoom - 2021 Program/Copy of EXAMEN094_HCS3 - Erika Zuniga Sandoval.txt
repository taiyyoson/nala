10:00:38 Morning. Good morning, how's it going today.
10:00:47 Today is our session, three. Yes. Yeah, keeping track of all of it.
10:00:54 How did it go How did you do with meeting your goals.
10:00:58 If you could give it a rating on terms of progress on one to 10, what would you give it.
10:01:05 I think for my exercise goal I would give it probably still in a US because there was like, there was a day where I was just like, No, not today.
10:01:15 But I'm still keeping up for the most part, and then for my eating goals. I did eat breakfast every day of the week so I would give that a 10.
10:01:26 And then in terms of incorporating like fruits and vegetables, I would give it like a seven. I could do better for sure but there was definitely more of an incorporation this week.
10:01:39 Okay.
10:01:41 Well, but I know you really wanted to work on eating something in the mornings.
10:01:46 Great, great job on that, and a very good start on thinking about how to add like more variety and fruits and vegetables so very, very good.
10:01:57 And in terms of stress this last week on that scale of one to 10. How would you say that your stress level was this last week.
10:02:06 Um, I think this last week would be more of like a six
10:02:13 semesters coming to an end for you too.
10:02:19 Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a lot of moving pieces.
10:02:23 See, and what are you hoping to check in about today pretty.
10:02:27 What do you think,
10:02:30 Oh nothing in particular, it's really just keeping up with what I'm trying to work on.
10:02:38 I think maybe something small that I'm noticing is that don't get outside as much as I need to every day.
10:02:46 And that's, yeah but especially since it's getting nicer out, I'm noticing that I want to be outside more. So, maybe trying to make sure I got side at least every day for 30 minutes just to get some sun.
10:03:02 That would be nice. So that's just kind of something I've been thinking about as the weather gets nicer.
10:03:08 So, as you're thinking of your goals for this upcoming week.
10:03:13 Are you thinking you want to continue the physical activity and that eating breakfast, an app that getting outdoors, or is that sort of what you thinking.
10:03:23 Yeah. So, and or see in the first going outdoors. You mentioned 30 minutes right.
10:03:39 How many days during the week.
10:03:48 I would say at least six days a week.
10:03:58 And your idea is just to get out there and maybe go for a walk or do you have a specific activity that you want to do that will absolutely get you to go out will definitely walking my dog, I haven't so great with that lately, or thing.
10:04:15 One thing. So walking my dog is for sure one thing to do, but also gardening. My mom is like she's going outside a lot more, you know, and helped her with that. So I think kind of being outside and doing some yard work is another good thing.
10:04:33 So I think kind of being outside and doing some yard work is another good thing. Yeah, I always think of Okay, is there an activity that I can associate it with that way it'll remind me okay now I need to go do this.
10:04:42 I think you have at least like two really good idea so it could be walking the dog or it could be helping your mom with gardening.
10:04:52 And for the previous goals, but let me just pull up here, for example for the eating practice, and the physical activity did you want to make any adjustments to those, or do you want to keep.
10:05:08 For example, eating a morning meal seven days a week, or I think a physical activity we have the 45 minute workout.
10:05:16 So 15 minute cardio 30 minutes of strengthening four days during the week. Is that still, are you want to keep those two.
10:05:32 Let me just write them out in our little sheet so that we can send you a quick summary of all those.
10:05:45 I'll do the confidence level at the end that way I could just get them all down.
10:06:00 Did you find.
10:06:03 I do you find the summary email that I sent over somewhat helpful. I've been trying to include some resources to hopefully help you, help you get idea so like Brandis items are like this lady said I know we talked about last week, definitely helpful I
10:06:18 I want to do the french toast sticks. I haven't done it yet but I want to do it this weekend, I don't know why, like growing up, we always had those french toast sticks as like the nose, and I like French toast but I never think to cut them up and like
10:06:36 make it easier lovely, even to go meal. Yeah, well I guess I remember we talked about how you like French toast. Oh, I wonder if they have like a recipe for for that on this site.
10:06:48 Because the site has a lot of different things and it's um it's promoted to be making like healthy eating and easier and easier thing right or like to develop habits that are easy for you, or how to slowly incorporate healthy, for example.
10:07:06 So has quite a few recipes I tried to find some that I felt would be things that I would try and I saw the French toast, and I think it was actually that Friday, actually went into the office and there's a little cafe next door, so I didn't meet them.
10:07:24 And they had some kind of version of French toast, and I had some. And I was thinking about you, my nose at them, because you planned it that I did.
10:07:35 Yeah, I did actually have french toast I went out to eat with the co worker and I got french toast was like, perfect. Yeah, but it's just that it was so funny.
10:07:47 I'm like, Oh my God.
10:07:49 Yeah, and then also when I was looking at the recipes I I think all of that just kind of left it in my mind.
10:07:56 Okay, so when you're thinking about your previous goal of eating a morning meal, seven days a week how confident are you that you can continue to do that on a scale of one to 10.
10:08:08 I look like a Marine, you know it's been going well this week so I think that keeps you going and motivated So good job to cap off the physical activity so working out this 45 minutes.
10:08:23 How confident, do you feel about being able to do that.
10:08:29 I'm like an eight. Yeah.
10:08:34 And feel as if something that you're still doing in the morning. Yeah and.
10:08:41 Are you finding that morning is the best time for you to do them.
10:08:46 Yeah.
10:08:50 Okay, so then the third one was going outdoors for 30 minutes, at least six days during the week, whether it's to walk your dog or to help with gardening, seeing.
10:09:01 Is there a specific time during the day that you're thinking for those.
10:09:06 I'm not really but most middle of the day.
10:09:13 Just the more specific we can make it. I feel it really helps us to, you know, put it on, on that schedule and that reminder that okay this is something that I want to do, and how confident, do you feel about being able to get outdoors for 30 minutes.
10:09:43 That was really fast.
10:09:47 I think it helps that you're continuing with your previous goal so then we already have those down, and we just need to discuss whether there's any modifications that have to happen around them, but I think you're good for this week, where there are messages
10:10:00 that stood out to you this week from the the text messages.
10:10:05 Anything that sort of motivated you to change something up or do something a little bit different.
10:10:12 Well I think like the text from this morning of kind of just like taking five minutes of mindfulness, that made me think of like going outside.
10:10:21 How like in the backyard I want to set up like a little like bench area to kind of just sit and relax. So that kind of stood out.
10:10:30 Just kind of little things like that, the reminders.
10:10:37 I can you just bring up something for me, because I know when we were asking about when I was asking you about going outside I was having you think of an activity.
10:10:48 And I think I wrote away into something like physical but yes, it could be as simple as going outside and sitting outdoors and practicing some mindfulness.
10:10:58 Yeah. So those are very good options to to get you to give you that reminder to get outdoors.
10:11:07 You've got that you that you brought that up to, there's multiple ways like the options are. And so,
10:11:17 what are some other successes that you have this week that you want to share any challenges that you're still facing that you want to problems around.
10:11:31 Um,
10:11:31 I don't know, I think success wise just being an eating breakfast was good.
10:11:38 But challenge wise, it is hard to be motivated to exercise and go out, especially when my back is always aching or there's always something aching and that's because I'm not as active as I usually am.
10:11:54 So, like, in terms of problem solving, it's just trying to be consistent with working out and kind of working through it and eventually these little aches and pains will go away.
10:12:06 I think you you hit the nail on the head at times when we don't have as much physical activity, then our body will will let us know.
10:12:17 And it takes, it might take some time to to adjust.
10:12:21 Because I know for example for the physical activity goal you've been doing that for at least two weeks now. Yes. Have you noticed changes have you noticed improvement.
10:12:32 Yeah, I think right now it's mostly just kind of the soreness and the inking, and for me the improvement shows up like a month later, after I'm like, I don't see anything it's like finally.
10:12:46 So I think for me it's just needing to be patient.
10:12:49 Okay. Yeah, that's true.
10:12:57 Yeah.
10:12:55 Yeah. We, we typically say you give any new idea at least a two week trial, but I think you bring up a great point that sometimes it might take a little longer.
10:13:05 So just bear, bear with it and keep it going. And also thinking about sort of long term goals and keeping it consistent for a longer period of time that might also make a difference.
10:13:20 Later on, right.
10:13:21 If you're able to keep it all consistent them, the modality of it might change the activity might look different.
10:13:29 So I think that's something also to consider, especially as you're talking about that motivation piece and how do we stay motivated to do something in my require just, you know, making a little change on the type of activity that you do, so that it something
10:13:46 different and your brain is like yeah I want to do is.
10:14:00 thoughts that you might have.
10:14:21 But luckily it's only two classes, so I can survive that, and I am back at work so that's nice too but I'm starting to be more active in terms of my day.
10:14:32 So I kind of nice getting back into that.
10:14:37 So when you say that you're back at work, you're going into the office, as opposed to working from home,
10:14:49 that it helps with their routine setup to writing and having to know when you have to be up early and getting different place.
10:14:58 Do you commute.
10:15:00 Like a long way or is it pretty nearby.
10:15:06 No, it's just the next town over. Okay, okay.
10:15:24 to.
10:15:24 We went really fast over there any resources that I can provide you this week.
10:15:31 Though I give us a little.
10:15:49 So I know you, you already, you're really doing you're doing really well with the practice and the exercise you want to add the 30 minutes of getting outdoors. Just wondering if there's any exercises or activities or resources around them static.
10:15:52 I think maybe if you just have more like food or smoothie idea send them my way but nothing extensive.
10:15:59 That's Yeah, that's it.
10:16:00 Okay, well if I see something fine are interesting.
10:16:06 Okay.
10:16:11 I'm always looking for things for for me too. So my goal.
10:16:26 Yeah, cuz I think even this week I, I was I've been doing a little bit more fruit smoothies just to incorporate some more fruits and the weather is getting a little warmer too so I think it's just
10:16:29 awesome.
10:16:33 is all for today.
10:16:38 Now, but I know you have a lot of things to get done so I will not take any more of your time.
10:16:43 Next week will be our last session, and I'll give you more details when we meet about next steps, but definitely come ready to think about the goals that you want to continue to work on.
10:16:56 Even after our, our sessions, and it could be things that you're currently working on right now or it could be something different, totally up to you.
