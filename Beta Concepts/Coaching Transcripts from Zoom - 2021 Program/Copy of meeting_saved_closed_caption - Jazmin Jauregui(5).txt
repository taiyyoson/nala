18:19:25 Oh do you go in person.
18:19:27 Um, yeah, I just started working back home, or back in the office.
18:19:32 Where do you work.
18:19:34 I work like an art in area in Sacramento and work for like a travel company.

18:19:52 Wow, what tribe.
18:19:57 I'm sorry Cena then did me walk.
18:20:09 Oh, no much but that's really awesome. Yeah.
18:20:08 Have you been working with them.
18:20:13 Oh, it's gonna be a year sorry I don't mean no it's like an interview, a year, this summer.
18:20:22 Cool. Yeah.
18:20:27 Well thank you for meeting with me again I know we didn't get a chance to like,
18:20:42 you know, just build rapport, because it was, we didn't have a lot of time and there was a lot of things happening. Do you feel, are you tight for time today as well.
18:20:45 No, no.
18:20:46 Okay.
18:21:02 But I'll do you have any questions for me before we get started.
18:21:12 Um, yes by, I guess we'll get started because you probably didn't jump into it like my goals and stuff.
18:21:21 I'm so sorry that it cut off and I didn't quite get hurt, hear me hear what you said.
18:21:29 Questions. Yeah, I do have a question but it's regarding like my, my goals that we set, but I'm sure we'll talk about it during the session. Okay.
18:21:39 Yeah, so we can talk about that now.
18:21:46 what, how did it go with your health goal.
18:21:50 Um, I think, I didn't realize how specific we set them, because we literally just said, like twice a week.
18:22:00 I you know I go to gym for like 20 to 30 minutes, but I went out of town this weekend. And so, I mean, I didn't have my gym there but I did go to like another gym and like I like worked out outdoors.
18:22:14 And so I kind of like for me like counted because I did some sort of like you know movement and exercise, but I kind of just wanted to like brought it up my goal, instead of specifying it to, you know, my gym so maybe like something more of like, I will,
18:22:30 you know like,
18:22:45 Just because I can't always go to the gym.
18:22:49 Yeah.
18:22:51 No, that's a good like shift and language.
18:22:56 And I think when it comes down to it, you these goals are for you. We're just helping you, like, like facilitate like right, keeping them.
18:23:10 So, it yeah for your goal like being active, two times out of the week I think was, I think we had set it for like 20 minutes, and one that'd be indoor, outdoor, let's just focus on like those 20 minutes so to speak.
18:23:28 So, that to go twice or be physically active twice. Yes, I did.
18:23:38 Yeah.
18:23:39 And then.
18:23:40 So a question that I have for you about that on a scale of one to 10. How do you think you did in meeting your goals, where one is like not great and 10 is great.
18:23:51 I think I met them. So I would say attend meetup.
18:23:57 Awesome.
18:23:59 How was that for you like meeting your health goals and being physically active. It was nice to kind of like get back on that train.
18:24:10 I feel like I'm, I definitely felt better. I felt like more energized throughout the week.
18:24:20 So, yeah, definitely made me like reminisce a little bit. Now I would like work out a lot, and be active. So, yeah,
18:24:27 I think being more energized and feeling better throughout the week is just such a positive thing to come out of this.
18:24:41 Cool. Was there anything else that you wanted to say about like your health goal this last week. Just thinking about the last week,
18:24:53 something regarding my health. Cool. Yeah.
18:24:56 All right.
18:24:57 Only thing that I was like oh you know like I should probably brought in it, because,
18:25:16 Cool. So, um, I have a couple of other questions, like standard guys questions for you. One is around your stress level.
18:25:14 On a scale of one to 10, what what's your stress level, this week.
18:25:22 Also, you're muted I'm not sure if you noticed.
18:25:27 Oh, Probably an eight.
18:25:32 Okay.
18:25:33 Yeah, it was a lot of assignments that were due and other things so, yeah.
18:25:41 So mostly like school stress. Yeah, it was more like school.
18:25:46 And like, I guess you could say like, Non school, stress, less stress. Yeah.
18:25:54 Yeah.
18:25:56 Um, so I think I might have mentioned this last.
18:26:01 Sorry my headphone pillow.
18:26:04 I think I might have mentioned this last week but if there's ever a, a goal that you want to set around like self care or stress management, we can definitely work that into this program, but I can definitely relate to stress overall.
18:26:23 Yeah.
18:26:25 What are you currently doing to manage your stress.
18:26:29 Um,
18:26:34 question. Honestly, I think, like, I mean, what I would want to do is like, you know, take a bath and like, read a book or something, or usually like go run outside like that.
18:26:47 minutes like before I go to bed like on my bed with no technology around that kind of helps.
18:27:10 But also, I've been really into essential oils out.
18:27:16 Yeah.
18:27:18 It's really good. Um, I, hey, how do you feel after doing those things.
18:27:26 I definitely feel a lot better like it's not.
18:27:32 I feel like almost like there's like a, like, like a huge like wait for my chest removed like I feel like, yeah, better.
18:27:45 Yeah, better. Um, so, how often do you get to practice these things. Um, I honestly try and I light a candle. Every night, or every day, sit on my desk.
18:27:58 Just like I like the Bath and Body Works candles like the bigger ones. And so that, you know, that I don't know it's something about just lighting up a candle, like just gets me like I feel much better I feel relaxed.
18:28:12 So I do that I try to try to do that every single time I'm like sitting in my desk and doing some school related stuff.
18:28:21 Yeah.
18:28:23 That's really good. I'm doing that one thing every day.
18:28:27 I'm assuming every day. I don't know if that's.
18:28:31 Yeah, I try to do it. Yeah.
18:28:33 Cool.
18:28:35 So, I'm sorry another just standardized question is around
18:28:46 the text messages.
18:28:48 Have you been getting messages.
18:28:51 Yes, um,
18:28:55 I, I think I'm more into like I'm a visual person so I really enjoyed the graphics.
18:29:06 So definitely caught my eye. I think the one, this weekend. There was one with like a girl and like the USS like campus like that one.
18:29:24 I saved on my phone I was like I like that. I'm like, I'm just like, I try not be on my phone as much like cuz I just really like draining to me like just, I get sucked in.
18:29:30 And so, The visuals are more appealing to me.
18:29:34 So I enjoyed those.
18:29:38 Yeah, cool. Did any of the messages, motivate you to like towards anything.
18:30:03 Um,
18:30:03 I think the, the, the graphic with the girl, it had like some open ended questions.
18:30:04 So it kind of just made me like ponder about like what I could do, you know, like, as a person.
18:30:12 So maybe think in that perspective, but for like health wise.
18:30:20 It wasn't really like the other graphic was good but it was just more of like, you know, getting up for 30 minutes and being physical but the other one maybe like think about just like other person like what steps have you taken so
18:30:38 cool. Well thank you for your comments.
18:30:43 So thinking about your health goals for this week. It can definitely still be the same as last week.
18:30:52 You can add two goals.
18:30:55 Three, three goals I would say is Max, where are you at today. Like, what would you like to do, like, add another goal, like apart from the working out for today's.
18:31:10 Yeah, if you want to keep that goal we can craft it to be more broad I think it's
18:31:20 like the way that you meet that activity.
18:31:25 And then we can we add like a self care one like where I like practice like at least like a self care activity of my choice.
18:31:40 Like, maybe, like in the week so like maybe
18:31:46 move we would revisit this next Wednesday right so it'd be
18:31:56 like
18:32:00 three days out of the week.
18:32:03 Like practice of self care.
18:32:07 Yeah.
18:32:09 So, what I'm.
18:32:31 also what would you consider like the self care activity. So I would say, practice.
18:32:43 Let's do painting I like painting I haven't been a while so we could do painting for 30 minutes for three times a week.
18:32:53 And then, why is this goal important to you.
18:33:00 Um, I think because software care of them, like, Barry, it's my. It's like a priority for me to like remain sane.
18:33:12 Yeah.
18:33:15 balances me out.
18:33:20 And is there something in particular about painting that sticks out to you.
18:33:25 Yeah.
18:33:26 So it's like, very like therapeutic for me.
18:33:35 That's really.
18:33:38 Do you have like painting supplies. I do, yes. Okay, cool. So it's obtainable because you have the supplies.
18:33:52 Okay.
18:33:57 So, um, the way that I worded the goal for you, is by saying, in the next week you will practice of self care activity specifically painting for at least 30 minutes on three days.
18:34:12 Yes.
18:34:19 And then for your first goal.
18:34:23 I changed it a little bit to say, in the next week, you will be physically active for.
18:34:31 And then this is, I had a question here. Did you want to do for at least 20 minutes or something.
18:34:39 Yes, yes.
18:34:42 We could do the same thing we could just make it broader so I could exercise. I think I said it for twice right.
18:34:49 Yeah, we could do. Um, yeah let's keep it up and revisit it we could do twice a week for 30 minutes, but it could be just engage and any like physical like outdoor activity and or working out.
18:35:11 Mm hmm.
18:35:11 And then two days.
18:35:13 So.
18:35:20 So, in the next week, I will be physically active for at least 30 minutes on two different days.
18:35:28 Uh huh.
18:35:31 And then, sorry I don't mean to, like, like I heard you earlier but just so that we're specific about this goal. Why is being physically active important to you this
18:35:44 to increase my energy and just be like overall a healthier person.
18:35:50 Okay.
18:35:56 Okay. And, on a scale of one to 10 What's your confidence level and meeting your SMART goal this week
18:36:06 is the exercise one sorry, 10. Okay.
18:36:21 And then, how about what's your confidence level for meeting your second goal around practicing self care for 30 minutes.
18:36:19 10.
18:36:22 Okay, cool.
18:36:26 And then do like would it be helpful to schedule, these things into your calendar, what would what would help you meet your goals.
18:36:39 Um, so I am a planner. And so what I I do like I just write it on my whiteboard.
18:36:48 And that kind of keeps me on track because I look at it every single day.
18:36:52 Yeah, so I just make note of it.
18:36:57 Cool. That's awesome.
18:36:58 And then is there anything that I can do to support you in meeting your goal.
18:37:05 No, I think you're doing everything I mean you're doing this for me so.
18:37:09 Yeah.
18:37:12 Um, Well, I think, if you're not interested in setting another goal.
18:37:18 That kind of concludes our session for today.
18:37:21 Do you have any questions.
18:37:27 No, not that I could think of.
18:37:30 Okay.
18:37:31 I'll be available for tech support. That sounds so funny. I'm not tech but texts, like through text messages.
18:37:41 If you have any questions, and then I'll check in with you during the week as well just to see how you're doing no obligation to respond but if you're like yeah I'm rocking it, or like no I need to, like, I need a little bit of motivation.
18:37:57 And I'm definitely tap on my shoulder and I can assist.
