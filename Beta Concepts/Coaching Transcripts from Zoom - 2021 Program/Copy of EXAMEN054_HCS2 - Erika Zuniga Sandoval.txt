08:59:46 Good morning.
08:59:49 I think you're on mute.
08:59:53 morning.
08:59:56 How are you today.
08:59:58 I'm doing well how are you good. I'm excited it's almost frightening.
09:00:05 Oh my gosh I know me too.
09:00:08 I don't have much plan but either way it's just nice not to be in front of a computer.
09:00:13 Oh my god.
09:00:15 I think I was in front of my computer like 12 hours.
09:00:21 Especially with work and school. It's just too much to like my computers like overheating.
09:00:31 I'm like my computer's like overheating. Yeah, I can, I can relate sometimes a little bit weird noises for less. Let's start our check in, and I wanted to ask, how was your goal for the week.
09:00:45 How did it go.
09:00:47 Were you able to completed.
09:00:50 Yeah, so I did complete it. I went once for the one hour. At first I was like oh my gosh one hour that's gonna be like so long just like walking and listening to this lady.
09:01:01 So I was like oh maybe I'll break it up into like 230 minute walks or something. Well, I ended up doing the full one hour, just because I got, like, lost in nature and stuff.
09:01:15 And then the second day I walked. Since I already done that video I just did a walk like without any music or anything and just like when it's kind of in silence to like, because in the one hour video she talked about a lot about, you know, like listen
09:01:32 to your surroundings and like what's around you and so on my second walk I just kind of tried to like be in tune with those things without a voice in my head.
09:01:43 Yeah. And, and that sort of guided can help us at the beginning right guided meditation, but then after, after we get through maybe a session, and we just start to notice things I think it's helpful to to also just do it on your own.
09:02:00 Mm hmm. But it's like a good start, thing, ya know, it was really good, and I liked.
09:02:07 I really liked it because now that I think about it, I haven't really gone on any type of walk or run without music and I even know how long because I always want you know music to like Pump me up and like walk or I walk with somebody.
09:02:23 So then I'm not listening to anything but just to like have that moment, and have that time to just like, be aware of my surroundings and of myself, was really nice.
09:02:34 Good, I'm glad, and so on a scale of one to 10 How did you do in meeting your goal for last week.
09:02:48 That's it. Okay, Good, and has this stress level this week.
09:02:55 I'm a lot less because I got that big exam like off of me.
09:03:07 But I, I'm still a little stress because now I realize all the little things that I've been pushing off.
09:03:12 While I was just studying because I'm like I'm not gonna do anything else and I do realize like oh I have other little assignments and things that I need to finish before like graduation.
09:03:21 And just like tying up loose ends and stuff so I'm still really busy, but my stress levels definitely down.
09:03:29 On a scale of one to 10. How would you read it for this week.
09:03:35 What was I last week like a nine.
09:03:38 Last week, where I think it was more of an aid I feel okay.
09:03:46 Just be probably like a five.
09:03:49 This week probably like a five. Remember it was, it was above five.
09:03:53 Mm hmm. I'll pull up next week I'll pull up the record from the previous week so I can compare it. Oh yeah.
09:04:05 theme.
09:04:05 And what are you thinking for this upcoming week now that you you've practiced some mindfulness meditation, with the walk in meditation.
09:04:15 I know you've completed your exam and that was something that was sort of hovering over you for some time. Is there something else that you want to focus on for this week, or health wellness.
09:04:29 I think I definitely want to challenge myself to do two more days of like the walking, just kind of like quiet.
09:04:43 Something now.
09:04:53 I remember we talked about some stuff.
09:04:56 Last week we had other kind of ideas. So do you want to challenge myself to do more.
09:05:09 I remember last week we talked about the mindfulness, or the meditation, and it was more for stress management.
09:05:19 The already walk which is part of physical activity.
09:05:24 I think we had talked about a little bit about spirituality.
09:05:29 Think.
09:05:31 So I'm trying to recall everything that we talked about the sort of the things that sort of stick out in my head, or did those sound familiar. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
09:05:44 Okay.
09:05:47 I just I'm not sure like should I have a new goal or should I like you so how. So the focus is really to check in with you today and see if. Is there something different that you want to check in about, do you want to set up a new goal for the week or
09:06:00 do you want to keep working on the one that you've been working on. So, for example, you mentioned adding two more days. And that would be working on this this thing goal but just adding on to it and that's perfectly fine too.
09:06:13 If right now you feel that's the most feasible and doable thing for you to do i think that's that's a good place to be.
09:06:23 Yeah. Okay, then let's do that. And then I was also just thinking about how you sent me like the my plate and like all the in season of food and like, maybe I could do something and you'd also mentioned last week, like, you can be mindful and all things
09:06:39 like even like cooking and stuff so maybe I'll try to do like a new like making new like recipes meal prep, this coming week.
09:06:51 I can be with like seasonal food and I can just be like, mindful kind of while I'm doing it.
09:07:00 So I'm hearing, two things you want to add two more days of walking or mindful walking.
09:07:13 Four days total just like two days total. Okay, so you want to do two days total. And then, how confident, do you feel about being able to do that two days.
09:07:21 I'm pretty confident, probably eight or nine
09:07:26 and remind me Do you walk in the afternoon or the morning and you want to keep the same time frame, like early early afternoon. Yeah.
09:07:39 Somewhere between like one and five I usually will go.
09:07:45 He said two times this.
09:07:48 Are there any specific days that you're thinking or you want to keep it flexible for two days within the week.
09:07:57 I'll probably keep it, flexible, like Sunday is a good day for me.
09:08:06 And then,
09:08:11 I don't know. The other day I have to figure out.
09:08:15 Sunday can be an option. Okay, that's good, that's good. And then now to sort of make the second one specific a little bit more specific, and you're thinking about meal prepping or you're thinking about using you seeing are creating a new recipe.
09:08:36 Um, I think I want to use a new recipe. Okay.
09:08:45 And I heard you thinking of using seasonal fruits or seasonal foods. Mm hmm, vegetables, fruit yeah
09:08:58 seasonal produce produce very that's more more general I can be both.
09:09:06 Like this.
09:09:23 And to make it more specific Are you thinking for one specific meal on a specific date for example breakfast, lunch, or dinner, in which they are you thinking if you're thinking of one or which days if you're thinking of multiple days. Oh, probably do
09:09:27 it on Monday and make it for like my dinner.
09:09:33 Like a Monday dinner. Yeah.
09:09:37 And I think the day that you have more flexibility, that's usually what I, I like to think about like what is it, where I have more flexibility to
09:09:49 try a new recipes seasonal products for dinner on Monday, and how confident, do you feel about being able to do that.
09:10:02 like, seven between a six or seven, I don't know if you can do half.
09:10:11 And what do you feel are some What is your hesitation, that you, that makes it feel like it could be a half.
09:10:20 I don't know if I will like find something new that all want to make this in like within my scope of like cooking, and I might just like default to something I've already done before.
09:10:32 But I don't want to do that.
09:10:34 So it's kind of like a challenge. I do have to like go out and find something new to make.
09:10:41 Because I don't have a lot of recipes I'm not a cook I don't actually like cooking I like baking.
09:10:49 But I need to cook, because nobody's here to make food for me.
09:10:57 Now I completely understand. I'm thinking, you mentioned that you like baking, and I'm just trying to think of how can we make this
09:11:07 an achievable goal, so that you use some of the skills that you already have.
09:11:14 So for example, have. Have you tried like roasting vegetables in the oven before.
09:11:19 Oh yeah, yeah I switched. Yeah, so that's it makes it made me think about it because you mentioned that you do like baking, so maybe it's something that you just put in the oven, like you put it together, put it in the oven, and then you don't have to
09:11:33 worry too much about mixing and
09:11:38 the other thing if you're thinking, maybe we could just take, take it even like a step back and it could be more of, find the recipe that you want to do.
09:11:49 And then later on we could focus on actually trying it out.
09:11:54 What are your thoughts.
09:11:56 Because I feel that you, you want to try a new recipe but it means that you also have to find the recipe.
09:12:03 Yeah, and I'm thinking it might actually be like a two in one that that we're trying to do. And so that if more people will we might want to break it apart and first focus on finding a recipe that you really like and then trying it out.
09:12:20 Okay, let's do that.
09:12:23 Yeah, yeah.
09:12:25 And I sent you the my plate.
09:12:29 Information at center the season of produce.
09:12:35 I didn't send you a link for a site that has recipes.
09:12:39 Now, ha. No, but I am subscribed to like New York Times, like the cooking email.
09:12:48 Those are always fun to look at but they're usually more work and require like more in gradients and like skill that I don't have but I always like to luck.
09:13:00 Yeah, there's like eating salads on there though. Yeah, let me see if I can find like easy recipes minimal ingredients, so that you don't have to go buy a bunch of ingredients that you might only use one.
09:13:16 Mm hmm. So for example, when I was asking about the vegetables typically.
09:13:21 And I like to roast vegetables in the oven and I just add pepper and like garlic salt and that's it. That way I can really taste like the flavor of the vegetables that I'm that I'm making and that's really all you need.
09:13:35 Yeah.
09:13:37 But it's right. I'm not much work.
09:13:40 I, I try to I definitely try. I definitely like when other people cook for me.
09:13:52 I guess.
09:13:55 So let's let me work that a little bit.
09:13:56 So we're thinking more of finding a new recipe.
09:14:02 And when do you want to spend time doing this, do you want to keep this or do you want to do it on Monday or do you want to do it on a different day of the week, and how much time do you want to spend, let's say looking it up or researching about a new
09:14:21 recipe.
09:14:21 I can do Monday because that is my like freest day like Monday evening.
09:14:28 Maybe 30 minutes to an hour, an hour might be long but I could definitely browse.
09:14:41 I think it's a good way to, to think of it because at times. We need to spend time doing the back end work of it before we actually put it into practice.
09:14:51 So I think this is a good way to see it.
09:14:55 And one of the things that I know you brought up is do you want to make sure that the recipe has like seasonal produce, so keep that in mind when you're when you're looking for, for your recipe.
09:15:08 Think of the seasonal produce that's that's in right now, and maybe just use those keywords to help you find a recipe with Lenten season right now.
09:15:21 I think oranges are in season, all year level Colorado's, yeah.
09:15:27 Based recipes, or.
09:15:31 Yeah, just some ideas.
09:15:43 Sounds good.
09:15:45 So if we make it to find our recipes are spending 30 minutes. On Monday we finding a new recipe that has seasonal produce how confident, do you feel about being able to do that.
09:15:57 Public nine.
09:16:00 Yeah, makes a world of a difference. Yeah, definitely.
09:16:04 Yeah, sometimes we just got to process and maybe take a little step back, before we can move fully for the thing that's good to look at you. I'm glad that we broke it up, and I'm glad that you brought it up because I was definitely like a little bit more
09:16:23 hesitant, or not. Yeah, I sense the hesitation when you said whoa, can I do a half and I'm like there's something there. Let's, let's uncover that little more, let's explore it.
09:16:36 Yeah.
09:16:37 Are there. Is there anything else that you want to check in about today.
09:16:41 For like goal setting, or anything else that's on your mind that you wanted to, to bring up.
09:16:51 Um, I think I'm pretty good on the goals.
09:16:54 I'm looking forward to doing them next week, because it's I'm a big list person so I get to like put it on my list and I'm like check it off once I've done it.
09:17:09 Yeah, nothing, nothing too much I've definitely been trying to spend more time just on my like
09:17:16 self care type things out super stressed and busy and have no time like I wasn't able to do like my nighttime routine and my morning routine I'm like just like skincare and stuff and I definitely enjoy those things so I've just been kind of going back
09:17:34 to doing those things now that I'm finished with my big exam.
09:17:41 And those are things that are important to you so finding time to be able to do that it's very important.
09:17:49 I'm glad that you have time and that you're making time now to be able to do those things, any challenges, any other successes that you have this week that you want to share I know you pass your exam and congratulations, that had been there for a while.
09:18:08 Anything else any other successes that you have, you were able to do your meditation.
09:18:18 Yeah, I think overall I just felt like I had a really productive week.
09:18:25 Because I'm not really the type to like finish, like I took my exam I'm not the type to like give myself like a week off and do absolutely nothing. I just keep like adding other things to my list of like to do things even if they're not like school related
09:18:40 like because I'm graduating in a couple of weeks like my thing was them like oh I want to like, I want to do like online shopping like my thing this week is to like, look for outfits and like, like I wanted to like buy my graduation outfit so that was
09:18:55 like a to do but it was like a fun to do.
09:19:00 So yeah, that's good, you're really getting ready when it's graduation for you.
09:19:07 May 21. Okay.
09:19:12 So, and you'll be done with all your classes by, by then.
09:19:15 Yeah, I think we're done maybe a good week before that so there's been this kind of a week of limbo. So, that's awesome. Welcome, early congratulations.
09:19:35 Thank you so excited on, and I've been ordering like stalls and cords and pins and they keep, you know, sending us emails for different little things to like, okay, right so yeah so interesting so is this part, because you're part of the nursing program.
09:19:45 correct.
09:19:50 Okay, so they have like a different process for the way they do things okay. That's awesome. It's always, it's just exciting to be in that at that stage I feel right to know that it's almost there and you work so hard, and you're going to finally see
09:20:03 it, you know, complete.
09:20:07 And I really wasn't able to like relish in it, until after this exam, because there's this whole thing about like if you don't pass the exam like you don't actually get to graduate.
09:20:16 After like so you get so many tries and if you don't so it's like I'm going to graduate but like I also might not if I don't, you know, get this done.
09:20:26 So like this last week I've really been able to just like, Am I am going to graduate hate to brace. Yeah, better. Yeah. Oh, I'm so glad I'm very, very proud of that.
09:20:38 That's that makes me excited for you. So, yes, yes, yes.
09:20:42 And one last question would be, in terms of the messages that you receive this week from the, the health and wellness information.
09:20:54 And it's more just those daily text messages themselves, are there any messages that stood out to you this week.
09:21:01 Did any of them motivate you to do something differently.
09:21:07 Try something new.
09:21:11 I like, I like the little picture one. I'm really visual so pictures like make me happy.
09:21:18 And that one was to be an active person to get 30 minutes of physical activity, every day, which I, which is usually one of my goals.
09:21:35 Like and the walking is making that possible to, so I'm thinking with your walking you're really doing two in one because you're practicing mindfulness and meditation, but you're also doing some physical activity.
09:21:43 I always say you know find ways to add something to the things that you're already doing so it doesn't feel like it's an extra thing that now you have to make time for.
09:22:01 Yeah, to two in ones are.
09:21:58 I love anything to him.
09:22:00 Yeah, it's good.
09:22:04 Any other questions you might have.
09:22:09 No I don't think so.
09:22:12 Pretty good preset are my goals, where you're going to send me another like a follow up email with all the stuff we kind of talked about, okay, yeah so I'll, I'll send you this time I'll do it by the end of today.
09:22:35 Okay, I'll send you a summary of the two goals, and that we said, and then I'll also find there's a site that have used before for like simple recipes and.
09:22:42 And I think then that might be helpful. And now you mentioned you have a resource but just just in case and just something extra that you can have as a resource to use.
09:22:53 So add on to the note.
09:22:56 And I want to say we already schedule, our upcoming sessions yes so they're going to be every Thursday morning. So I think we should be okay for for the next few weeks if anything comes up just, just let me know and we can figure something out.
09:23:11 Okay, I think.
09:23:17 I don't think there's any other questions that I have, looking at all my to do list and checks.
09:23:25 He does. All right.
09:23:28 Thank you so much. Thank you, wonderful rest of your week you to have a good weekend. You too.
