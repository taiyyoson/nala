17:17:46 No.
17:17:46 Okay, that's why I couldn't hear you, I didn't have my volume on.
17:17:51 Um, I also just realized that I'm connected to like kind of poor internet. So if we like experience any issues, all switch my face.
17:18:03 That's fine.
17:18:05 Right now it's like, like a weird thunderstorm, but I haven't really little weird weather for like the past several days.
17:18:13 I'm like just Wednesday.
17:18:17 Yeah, I had just left cash ago because that's where I worked, and it helps like actual like softball sized hail, in that area destroy like so much the, a lot of towns were out of power because of that.
17:18:30 And then there was like also a tornado that was like spin around there randomly.
17:18:35 And now today it's a continuation just thunderstorm. So, yeah, Texas is going through something right now I'm not really sure what's going on.
17:18:46 Wow, how I ran the.
17:18:54 Yeah.
17:18:52 That's a normal.
17:18:54 Oh, are you in your family okay though.
17:19:03 Yeah, we're fine because we're still a little more like in south south Texas, that that area so kind of like a little more like northern. He.
17:19:07 So there's differences. Okay.
17:19:10 Yeah, like in California I have like nor Kalin so cow.
17:19:14 It's like the same thing with Texas two different environments going on, but like y'all both yell both that for each other when it comes to being offended.
17:19:23 What do you mean, I don't know like if someone insults California Northern California is still going to defend California the same as a Southern California.
17:19:39 Like when it comes to other things are probably going to be like my side still better than your side.
17:19:40 So it's like in Texas will argue with each other.
17:19:44 It's like in Texas, well are you with each other. But we're still gonna be like you can't talk bad about us only we can.
17:19:57 So what's the beef before the between like the north and the south.
17:19:54 And that also has to do with like, I'm South has really been like more Hispanic and also like more progressive in a way because not really like the Bible Belt, and then you have northern Texas which is like the actual like Bible Belt like it's considered
17:20:11 the actual buckle up I will not say have like just that type of difference going on because we're also more Catholic down here they're more like evangelical Protestant and they just have a history of not liking Catholics for rude reasons and,
17:20:28 you know, we won't get into that, but very like that's like a very lengthy conversation but yeah Texas history it's just very it's very.
17:20:39 Yeah.
17:20:40 You know, I think that that could be said for every state, especially when it comes to like groups of people.
17:20:49 But we are here to talk about your health, my sleeping. Yeah.
17:20:58 I'm like, my confidence on it was a solid.
17:21:03 Nine. That what faulted me was the fact that I did get my co good my second shot.
17:21:20 I was really sore and I got really achy so I actually didn't sleep very well for one of those days just because like I was just I was just feeling achy and even though I took like some ibuprofen it's still like I woke up really still early I only saw
17:21:28 a simple couple of hours. Well, how are you feeling since I'm a pretty good when there was another day where I kind of like, I mean I still got a good amount of sleep, don't get me wrong, it was just a little bit less cuz I don't know what it was, but
17:21:45 two days after I started feeling better from the vaccine, you know no symptoms of anything, not even arm pain. I got like, I started getting a head cold.
17:21:56 And so then I would just got really congested one night so you know it's like that weird I can't breathe you but I can breathe but it's like super dry so I'm hating this yeah that's all.
17:22:09 Oh man. Those are the words.
17:22:12 I forgot what it was like to be sick because I hadn't been sick and so long and laughter experience that I was like, I don't want to do this again.
17:22:20 Yeah, definitely.
17:22:23 So, um, I think, you know, so there's like that you you mentioned like your competence level.
17:22:33 And you mean that was your confidence level for last week. That's what you, that's the number you had given me.
17:22:44 Okay, so on the scale of one to 10 How do you think you did in meeting your goal.
17:22:50 Well, if we don't account for those like two instances just because of circumstances, I said I'm pretty great, honestly.
17:23:02 So guys like a solid nine because like sometimes it was a little bit hard but like that's why I did enjoy the text because it reminded me like oh wait yeah this whole is asleep.
17:23:08 So I did enjoy reading the little tip sometimes I was just like, oh, like some things I didn't realize I did try to know more consistent, I did try to stay away from like my phone.
17:23:21 At least like 30 minutes to an hour before him, and I like an old book, like what I mean old me like, like, you know, it was written way back in the day.
17:23:33 He was like you know that's what like old English saying I like that's kind of lengthy and boring. So I was like, let's just for me to sleep and it worked pretty well.
17:23:45 Okay, cool.
17:23:47 So, um, I'm glad that you were enjoying the messages because I did set them up they were, I just got them all from one source, because it seemed pretty like comprehensive, in terms of like what we look for in terms of sleep.
17:24:07 So I'm glad that you found those helpful.
17:24:12 Um, regarding with the morning messages, the ones that come in. Why think they come in at 1030 your time right.
17:24:19 Yeah, like, yeah, almost close to the afternoon but there's like they're still good to you. Yeah.
17:24:26 Yeah, go ahead. I was gonna ask you about them.
17:24:30 I like the one where it was talking about.
17:24:34 Oh, when it was talking about the comet Asante though, so like you know how to like kind of nourish myself and like multiple ways, you know, not just like physical but also like a spiritual kind of way it's like it's kind of like meditate sometimes.
17:24:51 So, on that day.
17:24:53 It was really sunny outside I hadn't been outside of like, you know, sometime because I was busy with work.
17:25:03 This place my parents like the near these two trees, it's really peaceful, there's a mesquite trees. You've seen mesquite trees are very pretty with like how their leaves are and how they hang like they're they're very pretty.
17:25:13 Trees especially when they're like young trees, and so they have like a bench set up there, and there's like a bird's nest.
17:25:20 Well, like a birdhouse and inside is like an actual like little burden is so cute.
17:25:28 Um, so I just kind of sat there and then I kind of had a laugh because my neighbor from like, way over decided to do burning, and so I was just seeing that like fiasco go on.
17:25:39 It wasn't bad like they weren't they weren't gonna like set anything on fire but like it doesn't look like kind of like a plenty of dance that he was doing because I think he was trying to control it and I was like I shouldn't be laughing but I mean,
17:25:51 long as it goes that way. Yeah, it was windy and you would, it's common sense that you don't burn on windy days, but he chose to and so I saw that he was kind of struggling to keep the part where it was blowing towards like you know with water.
17:26:07 And I was like, well if all else fails, there's a pool right there, just, I mean, do what you need to do, I guess.
17:26:15 Yeah. And then I liked it when I was.
17:26:19 Oh, cuz I didn't realize strawberries and spinach were in season until I got that, like the little recipe. So I didn't get to try the recipe but I did keep it so that way I can try it eventually.
17:26:32 So you save the
17:26:36 little recipes like I never thought of having like a little siloed like that like that sounds like it'd be really good to have, like, especially before Halloween, or something.
17:26:50 Cool.
17:26:51 So like the photo one stood out to you.
17:26:58 Yeah.
17:26:58 Cool.
17:27:00 Um.
17:27:02 Anything else you want to add about the comments did they like motivate you in any way.
17:27:08 Yeah, because I got lazy one day but then I saw it says oh try a new activity and it's like biking or jogging and I was like, I mean I do both of those but I mean, I haven't done biking a while, so I decided to do biking.
17:27:21 Wow.
17:27:22 I got back into my little bike, I knew I hadn't used my bike and a lot of my tire was flat so
17:27:32 I was fun.
17:27:34 Nice.
17:27:45 Other nice of biking areas near you or do you just do like the neighborhoods. Yeah, the country road that we live on.
17:27:45 FM roads.
17:27:47 I really don't know what they really called I just know they're kind of like, not your highway and regular suburban road. Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, yeah, I used to live, kind of in the middle of California and so there's a lot of farming land, so I can, don't
17:28:07 exactly know what you're talking about. But I, if I reference it to like where I live. Yeah.
17:28:13 Cool.
17:28:14 So, um, the other like standard question that we ask is your stress level, like on a scale of one to 10 with your stress level was actually Hi this week it was that like an eight.
17:28:27 Okay.
17:28:29 You're on talk about that or is there some relation to the random hail.
17:28:35 It wasn't even that.
17:28:38 So, my parents want me to learn how to be responsible cuz they can afford to send me there but they do want to teach me how to like get into debt so that way I can learn how to pay for things myself because I never really done that before.
17:28:57 So they're trying to see we can a loans, but the school that I go to it's not like FAFSA has a like given them like their accreditation for them to give loans.
17:29:12 Unable to from a lot of places to get loans for that university because if it's all FAFSA classes and allow it. But fast I really only allows the international schools that have ties to American schools, but by my university doesn't have those kind of
17:29:28 ties because they don't know like they just don't do that.
17:29:33 So, we're probably gonna have to do it like a different way so we were just looking for something like that so that's that was like kind of stressing me out.
17:29:41 I'm just having to look for places because originally I thought oh I it's because he can't afford it wasn't the issue was the issue of like, oh they want to teach me this so I'm also a little stress about like having to learn how to do that sounds really
17:29:57 bad because I'm like 22 I should know how to do certain things but like it's just, I just like I guess been pretty sheltered in that sense.
17:30:04 Yeah.
17:30:08 I'm a, it can be intimidating.
17:30:12 It's kind of like your last time to like your childhood or like last time to independence.
17:30:20 And it's not necessarily easy, but because it's something that is important for you to pursue.
17:30:31 I think you're gonna you know a lot of value, like, from that debt that you create or that happen.
17:30:38 And I'm sure you probably know this but looking into private loans.
17:30:44 Yeah, so there's some that like we can get it's just, I guess cuz they don't I guess the way that they do they're, like, you have to start paying back kind of like immediately.
17:30:57 A.
17:31:04 Yeah, compared to like you don't really have that familiarity with like the other student loans. So like, in that case I said okay we'll pay it. And then once you get your like in back into the US and do my residency then they're going to like kind of
17:31:13 transfer it over to me to where I then have to start paying back on that sounds like.
17:31:24 So like I'm learning how to like start paying for things little by little and I do ask my friends that that they already on their own like they don't have any help anywhere else.
17:31:33 So I do ask them a lot for advice on how to do things because I don't know and like my friend she doesn't she's going into account team so it's also like kind of easier to talk to her because she knows how to explain it to me I'm like that kind of level
17:31:47 because I need that kind of explanation for me to understand how it works. Yeah.
17:31:53 Cool.
17:31:55 Well, it sounds like you have a good support system and you'll find, you'll find ways. I'm really.
17:32:01 Yeah, definitely. There's no doubt.
17:32:06 Um, yeah, but if you want, like, I know, health, or using the word health very broadly in this program, but if you want your health goal to be like your financial health.
17:32:19 I think that it kind of leads to like the stress right like with our financial health is poor, and we have increased stress. If our financial health is like Primo like that stresses reduced.
17:32:33 so there's like that connection to.
17:32:37 And so the other thing I want to mention about your health goal this week is.
17:32:52 senior three times.
17:32:54 I can't get annoyed with you, using me four times.
17:33:01 I mean, technically, like gone over like the health goal thing like can three times, I can, yeah you know like the first one was kind of like intro and then this is like a Africa.
17:33:13 Yeah.
17:33:15 Clearly, it's so not bad enough to where I'm like gonna be all annoyed like, Oh, This lady.
17:33:25 I'm glad to hear that. And if you have any feedback about the program.
17:33:32 For example, if you feel like it should be longer.
17:33:35 We do ask you to me us one more time for a follow up meeting. Sorry I should call it a feedback meeting. Okay.
17:33:43 I'll talk more about that, after we set your health goals. But, um, if I guess my point was, we're not going to be able to check in about your health goal, since this is our last session, but we can still set up your health goal, so that you know what
17:34:01 to work on.
17:34:04 What, what, what would you like to focus on this week.
17:34:26 I guess.
17:34:39 So I guess, focus on my, my, I guess like my mental health.
17:34:38 Yeah. Like, that's all I really thinking about now cuz I have finals coming up soon in like two weeks and then I have like this other tests that I have to take on top of that, like, a couple of days before actually three days before I have my neurobiology
17:34:57 final.
17:34:59 So it's, it's like you know once for the medical school and for, actually, this class for, you know, graduation.
17:35:07 So it's like, I felt a little bit stress I think it'd be good for me to focus on my mental health today.
17:35:16 I guess like drown myself with my work.
17:35:24 So, for you. What does like mental health, like, look like.
17:35:33 Like, mentally healthy or, or just like, for example, mental health, for me, is
17:35:48 thinking positive mental health for me as like showing gratitude, or mental health for me is reduced stress, like what.
17:35:59 Yeah, like mental health can encompass so much like what does it mean to you,
17:36:10 me being able to
17:36:16 have a clear thoughts.
17:36:23 And for myself not to feel like I'm like underwater I guess
17:36:40 so. As of now, like, what do you do to take care of your mental health.
17:36:46 I kind of like.
17:36:50 It's kind of a little higher for me now that I'm back home, just because like my dad's more respecting about sometimes when I just like want my space to just sometimes just like I like to think just be quiet around me or to just not have anyone talk to
17:37:05 me because I like to just be by myself.
17:37:09 Um, my dad does the same thing. So when I don't approach him, or I tell him ahead of time, he'll listen and he will talk to me and who act like I'm not there and I like that.
17:37:20 I tried to put my mom is and believe in that.
17:37:24 So, she's, she's the one that does bargain more she's the one that doesn't get it. So, it kind of like makes me stress the more because she's still bugging me about it, cuz she's like, like a fix kind of person versus, I'm gonna let you handle it the
17:37:42 way you need to handle it.
17:37:47 Yeah.
17:37:49 So like, I can do it, or I can like you know just kind of give myself my quiet time.
17:37:56 But it's just a little bit, a little bit harder than I've been home.
17:38:02 Yeah.
17:38:04 But it's very relatable.
17:38:08 Like in meeting piece to process things on your own.
17:38:13 And like work things out yourself.
17:38:16 And then like leaning for support, when you need it not necessarily when it's being pushed on you.
17:38:22 Yeah.
17:38:26 So I'm thinking about like boundaries, or like boundary setting with your mom and particular or having kind of like taking yourself on a date.
17:38:40 I don't know if you have done that before I do that in San Francisco, I had a wonderful time with myself. Ah, so let me just tell you that. Yeah, you're great company I know this year great company.
17:38:55 And so we can work towards setting two goals for yourself, or if there's one of those ideas that you like more than the other. Or maybe there's something else that you're just like, you know, thanks for the ideas Jasmine but this is the direction I want
17:39:10 to go.
17:39:17 I like, I like those ideas.
17:39:20 I'm actually really bad at setting boundaries.
17:39:24 I'm not, I'm not really good at it. I've talked to my it's got me it's like, got me into trouble a couple times. Actually, I talked to my friend her friends like you don't set boundaries and I was like well I think I am and then she's like no you say
17:39:37 it and then when someone pushes the boundary you kind of let them break the boundary you don't set boundary.
17:39:43 And I was like, I told them, she's like, but if they don't respect it you need to reinforce it to make it an actual boundary. So, like, it's just like hard for me because I don't really understand how to set a boundary, or even like where to set the boundary.
17:40:01 Mm hmm. So think of, like, a two circles like the small circle and the big circle like this first circle is like what you're comfortable with where you feel safety, where you feel happy where you feel like good about yourself and the things, and the people
17:40:20 around you, an X circle is like that kind of uncomfortable zone where you're like, oh, that kind of steak like like that.
17:40:32 I didn't like, I'm not her, but that kind of just like, Isn't it my comfort zone.
17:40:38 So you mentioned, like needing your personal space but your personal space not being respected. After you've said, like, you need.
17:40:50 So that's a time where, like, you want to reinforce the boundary and say like, this is what I'm comfortable with them this is what I'm meeting, you're kind of like pushing me into that red zone and I don't want to go there.
17:41:06 So I don't know if that visual helps understand like understand what you're saying now.
17:41:14 Yeah.
17:41:17 so kind of like when someone makes you feel like you're, or they're kind of in treating the little circle and pushing out like a little circle you're happy with a baby.
17:41:28 Yeah. And this could be a lot of things like.
17:41:31 I personally don't like to share my food, like, how do I say I don't like when people automatically grab food off my plate. But,
17:41:42 but I'm happy to share, as long as you ask like I just like require, or I just prefer that you ask. Same thing with my clothes like I'd be happy to let you borrow close, I just need you to ask.
17:41:55 This was have a sister, By the way, so that's where that one comes from.
17:41:59 Yes, yes.
17:42:02 And so it, the boundaries can look different ways and you can apply them to yeah just different aspects of your life.
17:42:12 So, you first think the boundary to whoever is like you're, you're talking with using the example of your mom, right. What I think you've already kind of given a good example of what you would say, do you want to just say it again.
17:42:32 Now that I prefer to be left alone for right now, huh.
17:42:37 Yeah.
17:42:39 Sorry I saw my dad and he's like oh yeah, cuz he gets it.
17:42:45 Why like what do you what do you need it for when I tell her she's like, well it's not that big of a deal and, like I like. And then she's like, yeah.
17:42:54 So maybe she needs. Maybe she's looking for more information.
17:42:59 She's all like type Monza same way but like my likes to kind of pry in and it's like you're a little bit like you know open the door a little bit so you can see like nothing's going on, but she's gonna be like that.
17:43:14 I can't see enough, it's like, you
17:43:19 know I feel like I'm in the bathroom stall and you're just staying at me as I go.
17:43:25 So comfortable. Hey, what you do it in there, rather that then like, that's what I feel like that's like my best comparison to how it feels like how she is sometimes.
17:43:37 Yeah.
17:43:38 So maybe you can set the boundary, a little differently to communicate.
17:43:48 Like so that she understand where you're coming from.
17:43:50 For example, like, I'm having a difficult time right now and then just leave them alone time.
17:43:59 It's nothing to worry about. I am fine, but the best thing that you can do for me, is give me my space.
17:44:07 That's the best thing that you can do for me right now.
17:44:11 I don't know how do you think she would react to something like that.
17:44:15 Well, I mean like.
17:44:18 That sounds like a great thing to say, I love to say that but the first era popped is like yeah she probably asked like, well, what's going on, or. Oh, it's because I feel like she just, she always has a rebuttal to things, any.
17:44:26 That's how she is she's very quick witted so she always has something like something to say, yeah, I mean I was like I know it's it's not say anything well on the hand is not how that control so I mean, that's where that's where me and her different but,
17:44:45 yeah. So, if she does that's, that's a moment where you reinforce the boundary.
17:44:52 So don't Yeah, I'm just like, okay, here's everything yeah like I guess if you want to know specific, I don't really like telling you the specifics It's weird.
17:45:05 So, a way to reinforce the boundary is. Thank you for your concern.
17:45:13 I'm not ready to talk about it. But when I am, I'll come back to you.
17:45:25 That makes sense.
17:45:27 Let's see it just seemed so simple and you say, like, in those moments.
17:45:41 I was like, it's a little bit difficult in those moments to think about it, because again, like it's not it's not natural to me. So I it sometimes takes me just a little bit longer to find my words.
17:45:47 It was just like this I'm sorry, give me like kind of like blueprints of.
17:45:52 Yeah.
17:46:03 Yeah.
17:45:55 Um, every new skill is a little rocky until you begin to practice it.
17:46:00 So definitely, you know look into other ways to set boundaries
17:46:09 and practicing with your mom is a good, good place to start, honestly.
17:46:14 And the other thing I want to just like circle back to is, you mentioned like you don't know what to do in those moments, and part of the reason that you feel like kind of almost like chaotic that's like my language, but like, like, Oh my goodness, it's
17:46:29 because that boundary was crossed. And so it's kind of a trigger for you to go into panic mode. When your boundaries are being crossed. So like, switching your body's reaction to like taking a deep breath.
17:46:48 Recognize that your boundaries are almost crossed.
17:46:54 And we reinforce it instead of like, allowing your boundary be crossed.
17:47:04 Yeah.
17:47:06 And so, is it is there another example that you want to like talk through.
17:47:12 just to. Yeah, use different languages needed.
17:47:19 Not really show is kinda like responds the same.
17:47:25 Mm hmm.
17:47:25 That's a nice so distance kind of thing and like, because she's so consistent with it I already know exactly what she's probably gonna say so it's wonderful.
17:47:37 Now it's time to do that back to her.
17:47:41 So
17:47:44 I appreciate your concern for me, but I just need space, I'll come back to you, and just every time.
17:47:54 I appreciate your concern for me, but I'm just leaving space right now. I'll circle back to you.
17:48:09 He's gonna mock me for and then I say exactly you understand what I'm saying, Oh,
17:48:12 I mean, if that's what it means, if that's what needs to happen for for your boundaries not to be crossed, then.
17:48:21 Yeah, cuz I mean I've tried it before with her and actually this is a very, this is a very good recent example. I came back from work, and I was just feeling very old for my work.
17:48:35 So I come in I don't say anything and my my mom's there, and then she asked me about work, and I just say, I don't feel like talking about it.
17:48:41 And I said, I would like to be alone.
17:48:44 And then she's like, Okay, I won't talk to you.
17:48:47 And then, as I'm there making my food. She just she's just, she slammed against thing, staring at me as I'm doing my thing. And so I don't know if it connected to her like I looked at it it's like well I'm not talking to you.
17:49:05 I said, I mean don't talk to me also mean like Please leave me alone.
17:49:10 And.
17:49:13 But, but I'm not, I'm not talking to you you're talking to me now I'm, like, that's not what I'm saying. All right, I just want to eat my salad and piece I don't want to be stared at us I'm trying to relax.
17:49:25 And then God pulled her away.
17:49:33 Um, so maybe instead of saying like, I don't want to talk right now like I just need some space.
17:49:43 Maybe you're so sorry, go ahead. Now, because continue is what you're saying is that I can see how like your mom is very like like smart, she's ready.
17:49:55 Yeah, she is.
17:49:57 Which is why whenever we have kind of like, I think at one point we stopped actually having an argument and we were just trying to have the last word and she's like you always have to have the last word and I said, I know but why do you have to always
17:50:11 have the last word to.
17:50:13 And then, mother. And then I said, but I can question and then she pulled the mom card like don't talk back to me kind of thing and then it was just like, yeah, I can, you know, I wanna.
17:50:28 Yeah, like, come back to me when you're ready to play nice.
17:50:36 Mama.
17:50:52 Mama your mama mama don't typically do that for their like I rule. A.
17:50:42 Yeah, it depends on the conversation with my mom but I hear you.
17:50:47 So, if the best thing for your mental health is to walk away. Then like Sophia.
17:50:56 I can't convince you, and if you're not willing to reason with me like, then maybe the conversation needs to end at this point.
17:51:05 Yeah, cuz harder about mental health with her, because she typically doesn't understand that it took me years for me to, like, explain to her like anxiety and they actually exist for people, because she doesn't see that as a person that's just like, oh,
17:51:23 we'll get over it, because she doesn't understand that not everyone can do that.
17:51:37 She's like, Well why and I said, I think it's, it's a good thing. It's a good reminder and then she's like, I'll feel you need to use that she's like they can just do it themselves.
17:51:46 Like you know she's kind of person where she doesn't really believe in kind of like the mental health stuff.
17:51:53 Yeah.
17:51:54 So, a strategy for that is saying like, you may not understand but that doesn't mean other people don't need.
17:52:10 Yeah.
17:52:21 Oh,
17:52:17 yeah.
17:52:21 To
17:52:39 me short my dad's six foot. So, yeah. She's literally a little nut.
17:52:34 He talks to me as usual look up at me I looked at her, she's like, discussing things in the mm like you're, you're in the position to talk, I guess, okay.
17:52:47 Yeah, maybe. I've heard of like the little people ego.
17:52:52 Oh, yeah, you know, like that reminds me of when my mom got a car for the first time, she hated it.
17:52:59 And then, why and then she's like, because you get bullied by all the other chokes, and she's like plus. Now I really can't see the road.
17:53:11 And then I was like, so you were admit you bullied cars and you were in your truck she's like, well, it's so easy to because you're just tower Oh,
17:53:19 that's a little person ego.
17:53:22 Yeah.
17:53:23 There's also this guy he's charted I Mom, this, this guy was only five one. He had like a lifted, you know, truck.
17:53:33 Huge chocolate at and everything.
17:53:35 He like jumped off and like you a little pipsqueak saying that truck.
17:53:41 We had the tall dude that was like about six one he just had like a small truck like you know the basic like all automatic like forward right. Yeah, oh one and obviously he towered over that thing as soon as he got out and I was like this is, this is
17:54:00 man ego. Yeah, they exist, but we're still show them respect and compassion, as well. hopefully it's mutual.
17:54:12 I'm because I'm looking at the time.
17:54:15 And I just wanted to let you know I do have another like coaching session at six o'clock. So, I don't mind being like a little late for that but their name it's going to pop up because it's the same zoom link.
17:54:29 Just like pretend like you don't see that.
17:54:35 And then, circling back to goals. Do you want me, or do you want to do it around, setting a boundary.
17:54:46 Yes, I can pry.
17:54:47 So in the next week.
17:54:50 You will practice.
17:55:01 study.
17:55:02 So, I think, like this might be a practice settings, I'll just say setting and reinforcing boundaries.
17:55:15 I think with this goal. It's a little difficult to make it measurable.
17:55:21 But I wonder if we can, like, maybe you can text me, like, two times or one time where you like you've set the boundary, and you're like, this is how it went, or something like that.
17:55:37 Does that feel like a good way to make it measurable or do you feel like you want to keep that private.
17:55:46 I don't have to explain what happened but I can, I can definitely tell you like when I was able to keep the boundary.
17:55:55 Okay, yeah.
17:55:58 That way if I don't, you can tell me like, okay, we'll try this I remember this you know what I mean.
17:56:04 Yeah. Okay.
17:56:06 Um, and then.
17:56:11 So let's just, excuse me, setting boundaries can be challenging one and also very exhausting. So, do you want to do like notify me once, or you want to practice this at least once or twice for the week.
17:56:28 Not that everybody's going to be constantly crossing your boundaries, but I'm just trying to make it like manageable at the same time.
17:56:38 Once or twice. Okay.
17:56:44 And then,
17:56:53 What is your confidence level,
17:57:09 because it's in a skill like about seven.
17:57:02 Would this be something that it would it would be helpful to send you like resources on.
17:57:07 Yeah.
17:57:14 Cool. Any other like question, or I guess for this one, like it's important or relevant to you.
17:57:23 What would you say why it's important, basically.
17:57:30 So I can practice setting healthy boundaries like in general to everyone around me.
17:57:57 So, what does like practice practicing setting boundaries do for you though.
17:58:08 Like, I thought I said that when I said it and help it just, it helps me feel safer in all my environments.
17:58:23 Hey, sorry if you did say that I totally must have missed it.
17:58:28 Sorry if you did say that I totally must have missed it. Yeah, like, yeah, I guess I guess that's more specific than that to help me so I why I want to set boundaries the ads because it helps me feel safer.
17:58:37 In my environments I go to school.
17:58:43 And then, did you want to work towards a second setting a second goal.
17:58:53 No currently This is gonna be pretty hard.
17:58:56 Okay.
17:58:58 I think I know we won't be setting an official second goal, but based on what you do, what will you have shared, I'd love for you to go on a date with yourself and take yourself to a nice dinner a nice walk a nice, whatever you enjoy.
17:59:18 And I think that could also be very beneficial for you to like manage all the things that you have coming up.
17:59:27 Yeah no wrong.
17:59:31 Yeah. Cool.
17:59:34 Um, okay, Well, let me.
17:59:38 And are you feeling good about this goal.
17:59:44 Okay.
