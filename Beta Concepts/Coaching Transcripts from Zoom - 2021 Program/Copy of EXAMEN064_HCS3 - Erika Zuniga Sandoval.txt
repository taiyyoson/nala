12:15:59 Hi, going.
12:16:02 It's going good.
12:16:03 Just so busy with that I was doing another meeting with them with school so, yeah.
12:16:12 It's Wednesday I had such a strange week this week, just glad that it was.
12:16:28 I just think, when I woke up this morning, I get, like, like my Google Calendar gives me like what I'm doing today and I was like, we How am I already checking in again like, like, oh my god it's Wednesday like I literally thought it was like honestly
12:16:35 I'm not even kidding. It felt like a Monday like I was like this week has gone so fast.
12:16:41 So I'm just like, wow, I cannot share the feeling, as opposed to go drop off some items at an off site today, make it up you know I make food I know I started responding.
12:16:59 and then added lemon supposed to do today.
12:17:05 And as opposed to drop off items.
12:17:22 930 in the morning. Mm hmm.
12:17:12 And if this also happens to me or if I don't put it on my calendar, it doesn't happen. Yeah, I didn't put it on my calendar, but yesterday, I spent most of the day, arranging that I had when I wake up in the morning, remember right.
12:17:29 Oh my goodness.
12:17:30 Okay.
12:17:40 If everything's in the car, asked them if I could do it this afternoon so I have one more meeting at one. And I'm hoping I can get dropped.
12:17:40 Yeah, well, I know it's so cool to be here well like I'm in San Francisco, so it's like freezing like I'm used to cold weather so it's like I know what cold is.
12:17:51 But this is just another level of cold it's just cold, cold, so I was like, Oh, I want to leave anywhere because I was like, going to go to Phils and like Now that everything's a little bit more open and get a coffee and like there's this huge patios
12:18:12 and like work outside and then this morning I woke up and I look up so my window and I'm like no, it's not happening. One of those like comfy work from home days.
12:18:16 Yeah, I think the weather in San Francisco tends to be a little bit cooler, so close to the water reminds me a little bit of monitoring. Yeah, that way.
12:18:24 Yeah, for sure.
12:18:26 So how was your, your last week, how was your goal. How did it go. And I know you went home, your goal was to do some type of physical activity or something active with the family.
12:18:39 Yeah, I went home and I ended up walking my dog with my sister so I was like really nice.
12:18:49 And it was I tracked it with my Apple Watch, so we did two miles.
12:18:54 So that was nice like we were walking to like track our minds were just like walking, you know, and when we wanted to go home I was like, oh my Apple Watch is still on and then we checked.
12:19:03 And it was exactly like 1.98 miles and so we kind of just went like to the stop sign and then back to our house, we like to be nice, good so what would you say on a scale of one to 10.
12:19:19 How did you do in meeting that goal. Over the weekend,
12:19:25 attend.
12:19:27 So that's good.
12:19:29 And how was your stress level last week with just say on a scale of one to 10.
12:19:39 It was like kind of six.
12:19:44 Okay. So you things going on, and have some stress in our lives right.
12:19:49 Yeah, but like, surprisingly, this week, because I was so stressed last week trying to get things done, that I kind of got a little ahead, because I was like, Oh, I'm going home this weekend like I'm not going to be able to do this is not.
12:20:04 And for some reason, on Sunday night.
12:20:07 I check like what assignments were do, and I had already done them, and I was like, oh okay so I don't have any homework this week.
12:20:16 I could get ahead for next week if I want to, but I think I'm just going to like take it slow and just enjoy it and then get back to like my normal routine like this weekend but yeah i was like such a contrast like last week I was so stressed, and there's
12:20:37 so much to do. And this week I'm like, Oh, it's just work that I have to focus on and, yeah, feeling to know that you don't have as many things to get done this week, because you actually did some of them ahead of time, so that's good.
12:20:45 And what are you hoping to check in about today. What do you want to focus on for this week.
12:20:56 We worked on physical activity has the strengthening going is going so good. Like, I feel strong every day and I feel so like good, um, and it's like motivating me to just like be curious about other things like, I don't know now that it's more like I'm
12:21:17 doing so good and like strength and stuff like I'm excited for like trying like yoga for example which is like not strength.
12:21:28 But what is strength like the way if you think this turning.
12:21:34 But it's like I'm more comfortable like stepping out of my comfort zone and stuff like I feel like I'm.
12:21:52 Oh, I don't know what I did. Okay, I feel like I started looking into like what's available around SF area and I found this like super cool like yoga outdoors.
12:21:51 But you do it with like headphones on, so it's. What do you call it, it's some kind of music associated with it. I haven't heard of it. It's called, and I've heard of a lot of things like go yoga.
12:22:06 It's yoga, but it's like, how is it. What's that thing, what's up those party types that you are at bones, I know you're talking about. You're all listening to same thing but to the outside world if they don't have headphones on, everyone I know yoga
12:22:21 silent disco yoga. Okay.
12:22:25 Doctor and the music it's all through the headphones and you're at the beach. The Ocean Beach which is like a five minute walk from me.
12:22:32 And everyone brings their own map, and you just get your own pair of headphones and sanitize it and stuff and then. Yeah, you just like connect it and it literally says like from any levels like beginners to like advanced like anyone can come, but I always
12:22:46 knew was there I just never was a confident enough to do it just because I know yoga, like, sounds like it's easy but I know it's hard like it's balance and strength and all these things and I always just thought like, I don't have that, but I don't know
12:23:00 I feel a bit more confident in doing that and so luckily I think I'm just going to book a class and ask like a friend if they want to come this weekend, or whenever they do.
12:23:13 I might want to go by myself just because just to see how I feel alone. But also, I think, inviting a friend or making them feel a little bit more like okay like if, if we both success.
12:23:25 I feel better about it.
12:23:30 Okay, definitely getting a body can make it powerful brain, like you said, it can motivate you.
12:23:39 Yeah, having a buddy is a good idea. So are you thinking for this week's goal to to be around doing the yoga this weekend.
12:23:58 I'm weekend. So I actually, um, I got a second job.
12:23:58 I know it's like, we just talked about, but like, so when I was an undergrad, I worked. I don't know if I told you this I worked out little lemon, when I was an undergrad.
12:24:09 So when I was an undergrad school, I worked a little lemon, it was like my first job as like a person in San Francisco like my eye. The reason I got it was because my roommate work there and then they needed people so that like I applied and I got it,
12:24:26 and I worked there for about a year. And then I graduated, and I was like, and then Copa happened so I was like okay like no work anymore. And my roommate who still works, not my room my old roommate he still works there she's like oh they're hiring because
12:24:39 like summers coming up and like you know they're really flexible on time and you already know everything so like they'll hire you. And I was like, Oh, I don't know, but also.
12:24:50 I also don't know if I've mentioned, but I'm going to be living in Mexico for two months.
12:24:57 So I'm not going to be like working or going to school I'm basically to my summer break over there.
12:25:03 So I, and I think we have savings for that, but I mean it doesn't hurt to have a little bit more cushion money. So, I told them that I would work if it's like every Friday or if it's only Fridays or Saturdays, though, Because I literally work.
12:25:23 I, my days our Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.
12:25:27 And so they were like, okay, and I only told them that I would I only like to work like two times a month.
12:25:33 Just because like I need to also set my own boundaries.
12:25:36 And yeah, so actually work this weekend.
12:25:40 So we're gone Friday and I work on Saturday.
12:25:44 So I don't know how I'm going to fit yoga this weekend I couldn't do it on Sunday.
12:25:50 Yeah, I can do it on like it also work on a different plan that you think would be more feasible for you to do that could be just something that you would decide to try when you have an opportunity.
12:26:02 But if there's, is there something. Is there another goal that you want to work on for this week.
12:26:09 I think my goal would be.
12:26:16 How are you going to manage all the things that you are putting on your plate. That's my question for you. I think it's going to tie to my goal like I still even though I'm going to work.
12:26:27 I still want to make time for gym like going to make some time where I can like do stress, so it's like.
12:26:35 Thankfully my they scheduled me on Friday from 1232 like 7pm. So I really want to make it a point to wake up early to go to the like gym and get like a good workout in and then go to work straight from there.
12:26:51 And what I like is that it's little 11 so it's like athletic wear so I can just literally go with like what I'm already wearing to the gym, so it doesn't like I don't need to like change or shower.
12:27:04 quick or just go as I am. Um, so yeah i think i think my goal is to stay consistent with my gym schedule, even though I have kind of an added responsibility now but just staying like keeping my, my schedule the same.
12:27:26 Yeah. Okay. Now that's a good goal. I think that's an important goal because as you're adding more things to your to your played You also want to make sure that you can keep up with the things that you had before, that we're helping you to stay active.
12:27:40 So, going to the gym and how many times this week.
12:27:45 So it's Wednesday, I want to go. Honestly, I want to go like Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday, because I'm not going today because it's really cold.
12:27:57 Yeah.
12:27:58 Yeah.
12:28:03 And remind me you typically will for how long each time I make like an hour long, like I cardio for like 30 minutes and then take a break and then just do stretches and stuff.
12:28:11 And do you go in the morning, afternoon and evening.
12:28:17 I usually go in the evening, but because of my schedule this weekend. I'm going to go in the mornings.
12:28:27 And typically, how do you remind yourself to do this do you set an alarm.
12:28:34 My Apple Watch. So I'll have it on and then it'll tell me like, it will do like that ring thing, like oh like you're like you're reading some not being summary.
12:28:48 Yeah, like at like nine, not even night like eight, I'm already like getting a notification I'm like okay yeah let's get it moving.
12:28:57 Okay.
12:28:58 Yeah, it tends to remind you to stay active or, like how you did yesterday versus where you are today. Yeah, that's a good way to track it.
12:29:09 Is there anything else that you think you know for this. Oh actually let me finish the first. Okay. How confident, do you feel about being able to achieve this goal.
12:29:19 On a scale of one to 10. So, going to the gym for at times during the week, or drama. I feel, I feel like a solid like nine, just because I don't have any other responsibilities like academic wise, so I can focus on that and work.
12:29:35 Anything else that you're thinking about for this upcoming week or do you think just working on one goal should be enough for now, because you have quite a bit going on.
12:29:44 Yeah, I think one goal is good enough.
12:29:51 I
12:29:51 am thinking about the messages that you've received so far. Are there any messages this last week that stood out to you.
12:30:00 Have you been able to put into practice or have any of them motivated you to do something new.
12:30:06 Um, I, I liked the one today which was the not the thinking of ways to get creative with coffee.
12:30:17 Because I think in the past.
12:30:20 I've always been a coffee lover like I'm such a big coffee person.
12:30:24 But I think it's the way I started off with coffee with Starbucks like caramel caramel frappuccino nose. And I just know it was so unhealthy like all the whipped cream on caramel, but that was what I knew coffee was, at that time, are still not till recently
12:30:42 and then, um, one of my like one of my friends was like, and I still even if I didn't get that then I kind of like graduated like just a caramel macchiato, which is really like I love that dream it's super good.
12:30:57 But my friend was like, oh, like, you know, you could get a drink, that's similar to come walk out oh but it's a little bit healthier, like substitute like your, your milk that you drink with drink with it adds like all these other things and I'm like
12:31:12 okay and I tried it and I really liked it and then. Ever since then, I've slowly transitioned out of like whole milk the cows milk to like almond milk and milk, and like soy milk, and like I never thought I'd like I've always been like a dairy person
12:31:29 like my family drinks dairy dairy like it's everywhere. But now, and I still do like I don't live in myself with cheese or anything like that but with like actual Milk.
12:31:40 Milk like with coffee like I'm such a more like aware of, like, you know how like it can be a little bit more healthier to like non get a frappuccino with whipped cream versus just like a good coffee with, you know, a substitute creamer feel like I got
12:32:00 my fix. So, yeah, that just like made me remember like oh yeah like, you know, things that you enjoy. You can still enjoy them. But with like a modification, you know, and so that that's what reminded me of that and, you know, stuff like that.
12:32:14 Yeah. And, and that's really what we want us to realize that we can still enjoy a lot of the foods that we that we like, we just got to put a little spin to them, so that they have that healthier alternative or healthier option right.
12:32:33 Yeah.
12:32:34 Or just have them in like really tiny portion seconds. Yeah.
12:32:41 So, okay, thank you thank you for sharing that.
12:32:44 Yeah, I think we went back and forth about that message.
12:32:48 So does come back to any other successes that you have this week that you want to share any other challenges that you're facing that you want to problem solve around
12:33:04 nomics specific ones, I, I mean I guess like I just feel so like, President with myself, and I feel so like, you know, I feel like I reflected all the time now, versus me a year ago literally around this time which was like Mac pandemic like everything
12:33:28 was like horrible. Like literally April 21 like I was horrible I guess the beginning of like you never saw the end.
12:33:37 I just reflect on how around that time I was going through like a not a super difficult breakup but it was also just like I needed to find myself again.
12:33:48 Moving back home, like, not knowing when I was in stay home and, you know, potentially like I had just graduated so I was concerned that I get, get, get, get to say goodbye to friends and stuff so I was just comparing like my life back then and now.
12:34:06 And I think like I just feel so happy that all of that happened you know and I think it's so weird to say because at that moment I really was like, I hate my life not hate my life but I was really just like upset that like I didn't have like resources
12:34:20 to stay in San Francisco, or I'm just like, it was very like a very bleak moment I feel, and I like would write stuff in my notes, and just even reading about things I would like think about myself and stuff like I was just so like very like it's really
12:34:40 sad to see how I thought of myself and I was just kind of like oh my god like. Now, I would never tolerate. People treating me that way or even treating myself that way.
12:34:52 And so I was just having that moment of reflection and I was just kind of like wow like I'm just so happy like it's.
12:34:59 And remember talking to my therapist around that time and she was like you know a year from now you're really just going to see your growth and I was just thinking like you're a liar like I feel so like horrible and like, this is not going to get better
12:35:10 like my like my life is just a mess and even my confidence as like a person you know like was just horrible like I was in a very like not good place with me and my self esteem, and I just felt like it was not going to get better and then now I'm just
12:35:26 so like happy and like proud of all my progress and I'm just like, wow, like, it's really surreal because people tell you like oh good better and you're just like, no, It's not like you're a liar and especially because I'm the type of person that like
12:35:50 want to see things like fast, like, like if you're into me feel better, like, I want to feel better and like the neck tomorrow and a couple weeks. And I realized that, because of all my like like past traumas and like, you know her, of course, I was going
12:35:58 to feel better within like a couple of weeks like took a lot of work.
12:36:02 Um, but yeah i was just reflecting on that and also just like friends that I've lost, but like not really lost because I decided to remove myself from situations and like the old guys that like would constantly be coming into my life and I would allow
12:36:16 it and I'm like blocked like don't want anything to do with you, and even like family members who are just like so bad and I always made excuses like oh they're my cousins so blah blah blah blah like they ended up being like the worst people in my life
12:36:31 so I was like, oh my goodness and so that was like a lot of growth, and now I'm just like so happy because my small group of friends, like the people that I trust and I know have been there for me.
12:36:43 And then, I don't know, it's just you know those moments where you just reflect on your life and you're like wow like a year ago, I would like not think I was gonna be here like, like in tuition that I'm now like happy and like, yeah.
12:36:57 You see how you've come a long way. And also just give yourself credit for the fact that you've put in the work to make this happen. It also didn't happen just overnight because you know you snap your fingers and it happened, know, like you put in work,
12:37:13 Now, like you put in work, you seek help, you talk to others you started to realize what situations were better for you than others and letting go certain things can be very difficult for us, especially when it comes to like I hear talk about family and
12:37:28 how sometimes we need to realize that they can hurt us more than that can help us.
12:37:33 Sadly, it's something very difficult to, to realize and to accept and to move on from, you know, is I think we are raised with this idea that you know family's always going to be family.
12:37:47 Yes, of course. But it doesn't mean that we have to be, you know, with them 24 seven to appreciate them, and, and, and you realize that with time. Yeah.
12:38:00 No sir. Yeah, I definitely agree.
12:38:04 And yeah and you definitely want to surround yourself with people that support your support you support your growth, and where you want to go. Yeah.
12:38:14 Yeah. So that was like a little success moment for me, I just reflected and I was also just like it was a good reflection because I was also able to accept that, while I was in very toxic environments or around people that I didn't want to be, I was also
12:38:30 not a good person myself like I also had a lot of toxic characteristics that I didn't like refuse to didn't like except like I was like, I'm not the one that's the problem.
12:38:43 And even though I wasn't the main problem I was still a problem and I just didn't want to acknowledge that. And now I could think about the way that like I react to certain things, or, you know, my stubbornness isn't just a personality trait but it's
12:38:59 also toxic, and like, stuff like that so I was also able to reflect and accept that I'm not perfect and honestly that sounds so cheesy but like, it was hard for me to accept because I was like no like.
12:39:14 Y'all are wrong like I part of the reason why we're here. The reason why this is happening. There's also like no like I am like leading it or like, I'm part of the problem so I was like, yeah,
12:39:28 of course we all we all have a role, rain, and in whatever it is that we're living.
12:39:34 It just depends how much of an active and useful role we want to play I guess it's time, and how aware we are of the role that we play, which I think you bring up a very good point like how Where are we that we ourselves have our own flaws and might be
12:39:48 contributing to the problems know experiencing.
12:39:53 Definitely.
12:39:55 Thank you so much for sharing.
12:39:59 Makes me think of a lot of things, you know, and then I got this book at Target it's called the story of my life.
12:40:07 And it's basically like journal prompts, because I'm good at writing my not writing but expressing my thoughts on my computer or my phone, but I'm never good at writing it out, and that one.
12:40:18 It's kind of like journal prompts but it's not like your typical journal prompts because I refuse to spend money on things that I can just google like oh I could use Google journal probably I was like I don't need to, you know, but this was different,
12:40:29 like this one actually caught my attention and it's basically like the story of your life like oh ask you like.
12:40:36 When was the moment you realize like blank in your childhood and then you fill it in and you write things down and I'm the only one that's so cool like it makes you think about your own life back just a random thought, oh that's so good.
12:40:50 Thank you, thank you for sharing.
12:40:54 Write it down. Any other questions I have for today we have some goal set up, and as always I'll send you a summary. I'm trying to think it will be around exercise so you have access to a gym, trying to think if there's any other resources that I can
12:41:10 provide you related to exercise or anything else that you're thinking,
12:41:17 like any other because typically if someone tells me for example they want to increase their water intake but they're not sure they don't really like water, how do how can they enjoy it so I send them some resources about why it's important to drink water
12:41:31 And I feel that you go to the gym you have access to the gym.
12:41:40 but also how to you know make water exciting.
12:41:41 I don't need to give you ideas on workouts to do because you you you have it down. Yeah.
12:41:47 But if there's anything that you think of, you're like, I'm not sure about this, I need some ideas, we can bounce off and figure it out, do some brainstorming around it.
12:41:58 Okay. Yeah, sounds good.
12:42:01 And today's session three so we have one more session next Wednesday. Okay.
12:42:10 Yes, so I know there's some sessions that will have on May 5 so I need to double check if they're still available, someone already told me they want to reschedule them.
