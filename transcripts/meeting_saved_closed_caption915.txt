[jadecuster] 11:46:15
Let me delete that.

[jadecuster] 11:46:23
And…

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:46:39
Okay, he's here. Admitting him.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:46:49
Hello!

[Alark Joshi] 11:46:52
Hi, good morning, how's it going?

[jadecuster] 11:46:53
Hello!

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:46:59
How are you? Yes.

[Alark Joshi] 11:46:59
Okay, and you hear me? Everything going well?

[Alark Joshi] 11:47:08
I'm just pulling up the statement of work.

[Alark Joshi] 11:47:26
Okay, great. Um.

[Alark Joshi] 11:47:32
Let's get started. Did you have any questions for me before we get started?

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:47:39
Sorry. Um… yeah, so we met with…

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:47:46
Drags on Friday to give, like, our preliminary presentation about, like.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:47:51
The what, the where, the why, and stuff. And he had some questions for us to ask you.

[Alark Joshi] 11:47:54
Mm-hmm. Okay, good.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:48:00
So… One thing that he wanted to know was, like, where the app should be hosted.

[Alark Joshi] 11:48:08
So there are these three options, I think render and… And one of them, of course.

[Alark Joshi] 11:48:16
Deal with another such option.

[Alark Joshi] 11:48:25
Yeah, one of those, you're not going to spend money, you'll find a free way to do it for now.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:48:35
And then… I don't know if we want to wait until we meet with… Professor Lengel to talk about the UI elements.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:48:43
But, like, just talking about, like, how users will use it and stuff like that, should we wait?

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:48:51
Or… can I send… Okay, okay.

[Alark Joshi] 11:48:53
Let's talk today. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think… I mean, I think there are two parts, and I think, honestly, we need to experiment with this, because.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:02
We've done a little bit of work on it, and there are… it's not like we are just making a website and we know how to do it. There are going to be some.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:10
New parts to this that we are going to have to figure out.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:13
So, in my mind. The chatbot needs to learn.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:19
How to, kind of, manage the conversation. And so, I think I was talking to you, Alina, last week about how one part of it could just be.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:29
Reprocessing the transcript. And testing it out in Python, even on the terminal.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:34
And trying to see if we are getting reasonable responses. Do whatever we type, right? Like, that's the first step.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:42
And then the UI is… kind of, you know, the second step where we…

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:49
Have some way for the user to interact with the underlying chatbot.

[Alark Joshi] 11:49:55
So, I think if you come up with a UI prototype for a basic chatbot, that's fine.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:01
Um, maybe there should be some way to… Login for people so that we have their user ID.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:08
And then we can connect there. We can basically maintain their session information.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:14
So that we can come back and kind of. Make sure that we provide contextual responses to them.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:21
Right? Like, one of the things we mentioned earlier was you want to remember what people have said.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:26
And give them that… personal touch, rather than just telling them the same things from a…

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:38
So, I guess my suggestion would be to come up with a UI prototype that you think might be interesting.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:45
Um, and this is something that you probably know anyway, but, like, you know, people are more than happy to give feedback if you show them something.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:52
If you just say, what do you want? People generally don't seem to give very good feedback.

[Alark Joshi] 11:50:58
Um, and so… you know, look up online if you need help, let me know.

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:03
Um, there are these wireframe websites maybe you've looked at already. I mean, I know y'all.

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:09
Are much more in tune with things than I am. Um, not Canva, it's the other one.

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:19
A lot of people seem to use that. Figma. So Figma has some templates that you can use, uh.

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:30
To create user interface. Without actually having to code all of that.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:51:36
Yes, I'm familiar with Figma.

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:38
Yeah.

[Alina Scantlebury] 11:51:43
Um…

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:44
What other questions would Jan have? Anything that comes to mind?

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:51:47
Yeah, I have… I actually have quite a few questions. So.

[Alark Joshi] 11:51:49
Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:51:50
How much cra- are you giving us… like, all of the creative freedom, I mean…

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:51:56
That doesn't really seem like you have any sort of prototype or POC… Um, at least on the UI end.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:52:02
But, I mean, do you have any POC that we could have access to, that we can play with?

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:02
Yeah. Yeah, so I have this Python… so Python has this chatbot.

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:13
Thing that works quite well. It's not very good, but… It's called…

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:21
Chatterbot. So it does a little bit of… it has this library, and it does a little bit of.

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:28
Processing for you based on some text that you give it.

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:31
Um, so I played with it in the summer, it's… fine. I will, uh, you know, maybe we should have either, uh.

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:39
Github repo or a Google… folder, and I can dump a bunch of things in there.

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:45
That's another place where I can dump some transcripts as well, that we have access to so far.

[Alark Joshi] 11:52:51
Um, they have a few more transcripts. That they have found that they are cleaning up right now, so hopefully that will help us with more data, right? Now you'll see.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:01
You know, a little… a few… like, 3 or 4 transcripts are going to give you.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:05
Average results, and… That's not good enough.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:53:11
Okay.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:11
Yeah, but UI, yeah, go for it. See what happens, we'll… You know, we want to try and make it as awesome as possible, but we don't have any, like.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:21
Fixed any plan in mind.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:53:23
Okay. Um, do you… I can make a, like, set up a preliminary GitHub repo then, just to, like, toss everything for now.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:29
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:53:30
So we can at least, like, play around with what you have so far.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:53:34
Uh, do you want us to create it under an org, or just, like… It doesn't really matter.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:39
Whatever you guys are comfortable with. It's kind of… yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:53:41
Okay. Uh, and then what are the transcripts? Do you know, like, if it's a lot of… Dude, and is this all the… are the transcripts the only source of data we have as of right now? Like, to train the chatbot on?

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:52
Yes. Yeah, yeah. They are basically text files.

[Alark Joshi] 11:53:57
And it's, you know… like, client… And…

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:04
Coach, or whatever, participant and coach, and so you kind of go back and forth between them, and they are very conversational.

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:11
So, the first step might just be to. You know, tag those. I manually, and make sure that.

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:19
You get the right response. If you ask, you know.

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:23
How do I eat better? And then the response is. How do I sleep better? Like, that doesn't make sense. Like, you want…

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:31
The answers to match to what the participant might say, not what the.

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:35
A gorgeous thing. Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:54:38
Okay. And then, do you… so do you have any sort of, like, a PRD or anything like that?

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:54:45
Um… Okay.

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:46
No, not really. I mean, we weren't asked. To provide that, uh…

[Alark Joshi] 11:54:53
By JAGS. We've been… Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:54:56
Okay, so then do you think there's any sort of, like… sprint goal we can set right now, such that we can have some sort of deliverable by next week.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:55:06
Is there anything that, in particular, that comes to mind for you?

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:55:09
When… for something you'd want by the time we meet with you next week?

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:14
Yeah, maybe, uh, like, a UI prototype, some… something that's easy, that would be good to have.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:20
I will make sure I get you the transcripts, that'll be good.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:25
And then, um… Either you can take one or two of those transcripts and.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:32
Play around with Python and see if you can make a basic chatbot with it, that would be good to demo.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:37
Uh, if you need… more time, that's fine, but I think by next week.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:42
I've been playing with it as well. I mean, there are, like.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:46
Some transformers that you can use to make the chatbot better than whatever chatbot gives you.

[Alark Joshi] 11:55:52
Um, but you guys can play with it as well, and we can… I'll send an email to Kelly after this and ask her if she can join us at this time. If she can't, then we can try and find some other times that work for her.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:56:04
Okay, that's perfect. Um, do you think you… Professor, do you think you'd put your… send us your GitHub username, so I can…

[Alark Joshi] 11:56:06
Yeah.

[Alark Joshi] 11:56:11
Yeah, it's just a lot. My first name, unusual, so I got it, yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:56:14
Just a… Oh, wow, okay, so just A-L-A-R-K?

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:56:20
All lowercase? Oh, wow, okay. That's a really cool username to have.

[Alark Joshi] 11:56:20
Yeah. Yep.

[jadecuster] 11:56:31
Um, I do have a question about the chatbot in Python.

[Alark Joshi] 11:56:33
Yeah. Yeah.

[jadecuster] 11:56:36
Would we want to keep it as a chatbot in Python the whole time, or eventually would we want to, like, start using, like, ChatGPT, like, the credits and all that, and link it through, like.

[jadecuster] 11:56:48
Databasing, and then using, like, AI embedding.

[Alark Joshi] 11:56:49
Yeah. Yes, we need all of that.

[Alark Joshi] 11:56:53
Later on. Uh… I think the thing for us to figure out is how much.

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:01
Chatgpt do we need? That's what I'm trying to say. Like, initially, we'll just try and… do it, like, using the data we have, like, very basic.

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:10
But later on, we'll be like, okay, we are running, so these limitations.

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:14
Uh, you know, also, like, ChatGPT, as well as, um. Like, anthropic, Claude, they have some better matching with our documents, so they might help us.

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:26
With, uh, document… like, third and, like, find the right response for us.

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:33
That might be worth looking into. Um, yeah, I mean, like I said in the pitch, I am a little averse to just.

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:40
And I mean, I've tried it, of course. I've tried just saying, okay, ChatGPT, you are… giving advice to somebody, what can you do? And it'll just give you, like, one piece of advice. We have…

[Alark Joshi] 11:57:51
Whole system, and I'll have. Professor Kelly tell you a little more about it. Like, there are steps in which you kind of have to have the conversation go.

[Alark Joshi] 11:58:01
And so, you can't just be like, eat better, food, sleep better, and then peace out, see you next week, you know?

[Alark Joshi] 11:58:07
It's a lot more structured than that. And we'll follow that structure in our chat.

[jadecuster] 11:58:13
Oh, okay. Um… Do you know, like, so ChatGPT, like, credits do you have to use? They're all, like, you have to buy them?

[jadecuster] 11:58:21
Is it something, like, we'll be doing, or is, like…

[Alark Joshi] 11:58:21
Yeah. I think you should ask JAGS if the department is paying for it, because it… I mean, I've, like, bought $5 worth of credits.

[Alark Joshi] 11:58:34
I think in April, and I've used $1 worth of credit so far, so it's not… Okay, I want to run through it. You might run through maybe, like, I mean, you are going to use a lot more than I am, so you might run, like.

[Alark Joshi] 11:58:48
25, 50 bucks at most, but at least ask Jax, you shouldn't be paying it out of pocket.

[jadecuster] 11:58:53
Okay, we'll ask him…

[Alark Joshi] 11:58:54
And if JAG says no, then, like, Kelly and I can… you know, pick a number, and we can…

[Alark Joshi] 11:59:01
Stick to that number. You know, so we can reimburse you up to, like, 50 bucks, for example.

[jadecuster] 11:59:05
Okay.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:59:11
Uh, this is kind of a question that's, like, out of, um… out of scope for now, but… When it comes to handing it off, so at the… so, you know, when we have the final product, and we're trying to hand it over.

[Alark Joshi] 11:59:17
Sure. Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:59:24
Um, do you have any idea of what… what that process might look like, like, what…

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:59:29
We might have as a completed project, and then the easiest way for, like.

[Taiyo Williamson] 11:59:33
You know, it's like to be able to… for you to deploy it really easy on your machine, or however we're gonna…

[Alark Joshi] 11:59:34
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean, I would say we are all CS people, so a GitHub repo would be the best way to turn it over.

[Alark Joshi] 11:59:47
We'll have a live deployed option so that people can actually use it.

[Alark Joshi] 11:59:51
Because we would like to run some pilot studies in the spring.

[Alark Joshi] 11:59:57
With real users, uh, and ideally, maybe even, like. Your pilot study with 3 or 4 people before the last week of your semester, just so you have.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:07
Some feedback, we can say, we tried it for 4 users, here is some feedback.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:10
And if we had infinite time, we would incorporate all of this into our next.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:15
Version, right? Uh, but we will want to use it. I have a student who's interested in working on it in the future.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:22
So I might have, uh, you know, that student continue working with me on that.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:27
Uh, and we can see what happens.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:00:30
Okay, okay, cool. Do you want us to, like, um… set up deployment options for, like, local deployment, like, on… just on someone's machine as well.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:41
I mean, I think it would be good for you to do that for testing purposes anyway.

[Alark Joshi] 12:00:46
Uh, so that you can… when you've tested it and it looks good, you can be like, okay, let's now push it online.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:00:47
Gotcha.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:00:54
Okay, okay.

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:00
Yeah. I mean, honestly, I don't know. What your future goals are, but, like, I think we are quite pumped about this. I think this is.

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:08
Potentially even a research paper that we will write on, you know, by next year.

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:14
It might be something for y'all to talk about with. You know, companies, and say, yeah, I'm part of this research project. It's not just a…

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:22
Let's build a website and deploy it. Like, there are many different avenues that we can pursue.

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:27
And hopefully you all enjoy, like, some of the AI aspects of it as well. I think it's… got a lot of potential.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:01:37
Okay.

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:38
Yeah. So, whatever… whenever you share the stuff with me, I will collect everything, package it, and push it to the GitHub repo.

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:47
So you can take… start taking a look at it.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:01:56
And then, also, the SOW… Did you look over the changes that were made there?

[Alark Joshi] 12:01:59
Yeah. Yeah, and looking at it right now, it looks fine.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:07
Um, I like that we have two different places where we're getting feedback from their team.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:14
You know, that shouldn't be a problem. Yeah, looks good to me.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:20
And worst case, if we can't get her to come to this weekly meeting.

[jadecuster] 12:02:20
Uh, quick question.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:25
Maybe what we can do is have the three of you meet with her in person once.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:30
A month or something, just to be like, hey, when are you on campus? We'd like to come and give you a demo, get her feedback.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:37
And keep going. That way, you don't… you get some feedback from her on a regular basis.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:45
Go ahead, Indeed.

[jadecuster] 12:02:47
Um, I just wanted to know, uh, like, Professor, uh, Lango.

[Alark Joshi] 12:02:53
Clearly, yeah.

[jadecuster] 12:02:53
Does she have, like, a team that she wants us to, like, maybe send updates more periodically?

[jadecuster] 12:02:59
Like, hey, can you test this? Or, like… or is it just, like, her?

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:05
So she has… So she has two master's students who are close to graduation.

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:11
She had a full-time. Staff member who… works at the local non-profit, also works on this project.

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:20
And then she has one… ex-student and alum, who's now doing their PhD at UC Merced.

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:27
So, there are all these people who are in. World in various ways.

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:32
But I don't think that they are, like, technical people. But they might give you feedback on, like, oh, here are things that should happen in.

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:42
They might not have technical feedback, but they might have more.

[Alark Joshi] 12:03:46
Actual feedback on coaching.

[jadecuster] 12:03:49
Okay, got it. Um… Do you know if we'd meet, like, besides the other meetings, do you think they'd be against us? Like…

[jadecuster] 12:03:57
Collaborating more often, like, hey. What do you think of this?

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:02
I think whoever is available is in… is… potentially able to collaborate.

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:08
My perception right now is that. A lot of these people are either full-time employees elsewhere, or, like, almost close to graduating, or, like, that guy that you see Merced starting his PhD.

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:22
So we can invite them and put them. You know, add them to emails if you want to send out updates.

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:30
That might be worth it, so they can chime in if they want to be involved.

[jadecuster] 12:04:35
Okay, got it.

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:36
I just, I guess I'm saying, you know, like, let's say, Jade, you were graduating in, like, 2 months.

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:42
How much involvement would you have? With something, right? Like, that's what I'm trying to say. They may not be as involved as we would like. If somebody was starting their master's program now.

[Alark Joshi] 12:04:52
Or they were in their second year of a two-year master's program. They might be more… interested in staying involved.

[jadecuster] 12:05:04
Got it, thank you

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:06
Yeah. I will respond, uh, not respond, I will actually send an email to…

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:16
Professor Kelly right now, and copy the three of you on it.

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:21
And introduce you, um, and then say that. Tentatively, our meetings are on Mondays from 11.45 to 12.15. If anything…

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:30
If you can make it, that would be great. Um, we'll leave it at that, and then after I…

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:37
I mean, I'm assuming Tayo has already sent me stuff, but… I will add things to the GitHub repo.

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:43
Let you know when it pushed it on to the vehicle.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:05:47
Yeah, I can set that up, like, as soon as we finish this meeting.

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:49
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's no rush.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:05:50
Uh, is there an easier… is there an easier way to reach you?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:05:53
Other than email, or is email probably the best form of contact?

[Alark Joshi] 12:05:56
Email is fine, I check email a lot. Um, if… Black is also fine.

[Alark Joshi] 12:06:03
I'm on the department Slack. I'm not, like, online all the time, but I do check it frequently.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:06:11
Okay, okay, perfect. Because we were thinking of using, um…

[Alark Joshi] 12:06:13
Yeah, yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:06:17
We're on a Slack channel, so we're thinking. It also might be easier if we can clue you in, or add you into that Slack channel, so you can stay up to date with, like, our…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:06:27
Communications. Okay.

[Alark Joshi] 12:06:27
Sure. Whatever is easiest, I'm fine with you.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:06:40
I have no more questions, so…

[Alark Joshi] 12:06:44
Yeah, I'm excited to work with you all. You know, I've had dated my class a couple of times, I've heard good things about the other two of you, so…

[Alark Joshi] 12:06:52
I'm excited. Uh, it'll be fun, and… Like, I'm very focused on getting this out there.

[Alark Joshi] 12:06:59
As well as, you know, Professor Kelly is also, like, an awesome person to work with, so… It'll be fun, and…

[Alark Joshi] 12:07:08
I honestly think it'll be good for y'all to have this on your resume, so it's not just, like, some random fluff that… might be, you know, not as interesting.

[Alark Joshi] 12:07:21
Okay, I guess that's it for now. Thank you, everybody, and we'll stick to this time.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:07:24
Yes.

[Alark Joshi] 12:07:28
Well, the near future, and then… If she can't make it, we'll see what we can do.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:07:33
Yeah, thank you, Professor. Hopefully next week, we'll have the deliverables, and then… come with, like, a little more stricter agenda that we could follow.

[Alark Joshi] 12:07:41
That's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and I'll be honest with you, I'm, like.

[Alark Joshi] 12:07:47
Teaching 112, I have two other research projects going on, I'm finishing up a book, and we have just submitted the manuscript to the publisher, so things are a little crazy right now.

[Alark Joshi] 12:07:57
Don't hesitate to ping me if you don't hear from me for 24 hours, okay?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:02
Cool, thank you.

[Alark Joshi] 12:08:04
Okay, take care, I'll see you all around. If not, I'll see you next week on Monday.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:08:08
Thank you so much. Yes.

[jadecuster] 12:08:10
Thank you!

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:10
Thank you.

[Alark Joshi] 12:08:12
Bye, thank you

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:08:16
Oh, bye, Jake.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:17
Oh, why did Jade leave? I thought we were gonna do a little post-game…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:08:22
Yeah. But I remember saying that she, like, is in a break.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:23
Review or something. Are you texting her to come back?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:28
Okay.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:34
Well, it's not 12.15 yet, she's fine.

[jadecuster] 12:08:40
I misclicked, my bad. I thought I was editing the meeting notes, and I was editing Zoom.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:08:50
He's very, like, I don't really care about anything.

[jadecuster] 12:08:52
Well… I can't hear you. Hold on, sorry.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:53
He is so… he has not… he has… he basically doesn't know what the project is.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:08:58
So, I feel that's the impression I'm getting.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:08:58
No, you're good. I said that he just, like, doesn't really know any…

[jadecuster] 12:09:02
Sorry, can we restart? I heard nothing.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:09:06
Oh, you can end the recording, or do you guys want to keep recording this?

[jadecuster] 12:09:10
Oh, we can keep recording.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:09:13
Mm-hmm.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:09:14
Oops, I just talked smack about him. It's on recording.

[jadecuster] 12:09:18
It's okay, I mean, it's just gonna be a video, we can just clip off the last… Two minutes.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:09:22
Yeah, yeah, please do, please do.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:09:28
Also, like, we can't… 31, 30-minute meeting a week. I'm just scared that Jags is gonna be like.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:09:36
He promised you an hour.

[jadecuster] 12:09:38
Well, I mean, we might have another meeting later with Kelly this week.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:09:42
We can always… we can always set up more meetings. I think that's why I also want to come with an agenda, so we can kind of just be like.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:09:49
Yo, Alark, this is what I want to talk about, this, this, this, this, this, and then just go through the items, so… Yeah.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:09:53
Yeah. Today was very impromptu, I didn't really want to…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:09:58
This is just, honestly, this is just, like, a personal project at this point. I mean… So, I think, you know…

[jadecuster] 12:10:04
Yeah…

[jadecuster] 12:10:09
I mean, hopefully, as, like, time goes on, maybe we'll have just meetings of, like.

[jadecuster] 12:10:14
Professor Kelly's team as well. So, like, a 30-minute with Alar, and then, like.

[jadecuster] 12:10:20
A 30-minute with Kelly's team. Because I'm like, do either of you know anything about, like, psychology or anything?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:10:23
Yeah.

[jadecuster] 12:10:30
Because I'm like…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:10:31
Nope. I've never even taken AP Psych, so I don't know.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:10:31
I've taken, like… I think only one side class, actually, so…

[jadecuster] 12:10:39
Okay, so, like, we're in the dark about how coaching should actually happen.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:10:44
I mean, my roommate is a psych major, so… We got that.

[jadecuster] 12:10:49
Do we add your roommate as a user?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:10:51
Yeah.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:10:57
But yeah, for the next meeting, I just feel like there's nothing… really to do. Because he hasn't given us anything.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:03
Yeah, well, so he'll, he'll add… I'm gonna email him about the repo.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:08
He'll add the stuff. I think for this week, we can just focus on, like, Jade, you can do the handle of the preprocessing, I'll handle backend, and then some other stuff.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:17
And then, Alina, you have, like, all the creative freedom in the world to set up a UI prototype, so it's whatever you want to do with that.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:11:21
Yeah. I already started a prototype-ish.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:27
Okay. So, like, if we can get all of that by Friday… I think we'll be in a good spot, at least for the first week, because, you know, it'll be slow to start, and then we'll ramp up more.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:11:38
Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:38
I do kind of want to schedule another meeting with the Lark.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:42
But… I don't know how he can help us is the problem.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:11:46
I guess, yeah. We can go to his office hours. I think that… that was, like, Thursday at, like…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:50
What is his office hours?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:11:55
I don't remember what time, but it's in the group chat when I went.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:11:59
Well, can you let us know what the office hours are?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:12:00
I don't think… Yeah…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:12:05
Yeah, I mean, I want to meet with him more, I just don't know how he can help us, like… there's not really any, like, special expertise I feel like he can provide us with.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:12:15
Mm-hmm.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:12:18
Um… And…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:12:22
He doesn't even know, he doesn't even have, like, a specific… idea of what the project's supposed to look like, so…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:12:31
So, yeah…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:12:32
And I thought he was gonna give me more of, like, how he wants the app to work, but he literally just wants it to be, like, a chat.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:12:41
Like, that's all you really want. You don't want, like, a goal tracker.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:12:43
Because… just let me show you what I have. Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:12:47
Yeah. Are you sharing your screen?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:12:56
Like this, like, you log in, you describe who you are, what you want to achieve.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:12:59
Wait, you have a lot already!

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:01
This is from, like, Google just came out with a new AI for, like, UI, so I… it made this in, like, literally 30 seconds.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:13:06
Oh, okay. That's actually so fucking funny, I'm not gonna lie.

[jadecuster] 12:13:07
Oh…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:13
So yeah. Like, this is good.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:18
Like, he didn't say anything about, like, a progress tracker, he literally just said, like.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:22
A chat. I'm like, but how do you want it to flow? Like, how do you want it to be used?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:29
So, I don't know.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:13:30
Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:13:35
Okay, I was thinking we could make an org for this, but…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:41
He has office hours on Thursday from 2.30 to 3.30. Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:13:44
Okay, that's actually perfect, I can make that.

[jadecuster] 12:13:47
I can too. We could have, like, mini-meetings on Thursdays.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:13:51
Mm-hmm.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:13:51
I like that, I like that. Because I was, like, right before… Oh, that's, like, right before our, um, sprint, or our… our weekly scrum as well, and the… the presentation.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:03
So it's a good time to, like, we can, like, check in with him right before our presentation, stuff like that.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:08
That's cool.

[jadecuster] 12:14:12
Uh, we didn't really get a comprehensive why, either.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:14:16
Yeah, I just feel like he doesn't really, like…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:18
Oh, true. But yeah, what the… what? Wait, what? Well, yeah, why? Wait…

[jadecuster] 12:14:22
I mean, we kind of asked him, and he was like…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:14:24
Yeah, I'm just gonna rewatch the video, and then ask Professor Kelly, or… whatever her name is, Kelly.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:14:32
Langle. Yeah. Because I feel like she has more passion about it than he does, I would assume.

[jadecuster] 12:14:33
Kelly Engel? We are.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:34
We're so cooked, bro.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:40
Yeah, I agree. Um, what? What?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:45
Jade, what's your GitHub username?

[jadecuster] 12:14:48
I'm pretty sure it's Jade Custer. Like, just all lowercase.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:14:53
Okay. Sent you an invite, then Alina, what was your username again? I don't remember.

[jadecuster] 12:14:57
Yeah.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:15:01
Let's see… It's just Alina Skinnerberry.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:15:07
All lowercase. Yeah.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:15:08
Are you sure? This is not… oh, there we go. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:15:12
I used my school one for… the tour made, and I don't use that one, so…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:15:21
I'm actually kind of scared. I've been using my school email for, like, everything.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:15:26
And I know we keep our email after we graduate. But I'm hope, I'm praying that it's not gonna, like, mess up my entire…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:15:35
Like, workflow or whatever.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:15:36
Yeah, I only used it for the Choremate project.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:15:40
Yeah, that's smart. I'm terrified of what's gonna happen. I have my… my school email is literally linked to, like, every important thing I use, ever, right now.

[jadecuster] 12:15:49
You can add a… you can add a second email for… GitHub, at least.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:15:56
Wait, what? Oh, yeah, I know. Well, that's what I mean, it's not just GitHub I'm worried about, where I'm, like, it's like everything else.

[jadecuster] 12:15:57
You can add a second email to GitHub.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:16:07
So, I don't know. Yeah, because I thought this… yeah, I don't know, man.

[jadecuster] 12:16:08
Start… start downloading everything.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:16:08
Yeah.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:16:14
That's what happened to my Google Photos for high school. Like, once I graduated, they shut it off, and so all of my pictures from, like, middle school and high school…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:16:20
Yeah, that was a sign for me, too. Not my grand photos, but, like, everything else.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:16:28
Unfortunately. But he still didn't sign the frickin' thing.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:16:33
The SOW, so at least we have video of him saying, like, it's fine, it's good.

[jadecuster] 12:16:33
Oh, shit.

[jadecuster] 12:16:40
Maybe when we… so send him the email about the GitHub, just add a… Hey, can you make sure to sign the SOW and send it back?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:16:47
Oh, okay.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:16:48
Oh, sure. I'm writing the email right now, so I can include that. Yeah, let me see you guys as well.

[jadecuster] 12:16:54
Perfect. And then, like. The… uh, for what to do this Friday, we're good to just stick with what the…

[jadecuster] 12:17:06
Chatgpt2 gave us as, like, our sprint. Goals.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:17:06
Yep. I think it's pretty accurate, yeah.

[jadecuster] 12:17:11
Okay, perfect. Um, I'll play around with the chatterbot, but I… long-term, it's not gonna work.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:17:21
With a what?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:17:21
Mm-hmm.

[jadecuster] 12:17:22
Long… the Python chatterbot? Yeah, but long-term, I'd…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:17:26
Oh…

[jadecuster] 12:17:29
I've got to start doing, like. Things with either ChatGPT or Anthropic.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:17:38
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

[jadecuster] 12:17:39
Especially if he wants, like, lifelike coaching.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:17:40
Use that to be… but yeah. Using ChatGPT.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:17:47
With ChatGBT to make a ChatGPT wrapper chatbot.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:17:52
Yeah, I like Claude, too.

[jadecuster] 12:17:53
Do people have a preference towards, like, anthropic or ChatGPT, or whatever?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:17:56
I actually way prefer Anthropic, or Claude. I think it's… it's so much stronger and better.

[jadecuster] 12:18:00
Okay.

[jadecuster] 12:18:06
Yeah, um, let me look into it. Um, honestly, I'm basing it… this off of, like, what we did in… I don't know if you guys had Phil for 272?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:18:09
Yeah. I could…

[jadecuster] 12:18:16
I'm like, I know we used both. And I'm like…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:18:17
You didn't ask this before, I did not.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:18:18
Yeah. It wasn't too bad, but I assume it would be, like, the same thing for…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:18:25
Using Claude instead.

[jadecuster] 12:18:29
Got it. Did he have a preference on database, too?

[jadecuster] 12:18:34
Do we know? Do we remember?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:18:36
Did we ask him? He… I think he put, like, a sequel database, right?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:18:45
Like, Postgres? Postgres?

[jadecuster] 12:18:47
That's what it was, yeah. Uh, have either of you ever used it?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:18:52
Uh, I say I have, but I have, like, practically no experience with.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:18:58
Sql databases, only NoSQL databases.

[jadecuster] 12:19:03
I don't know. I'll probably just also look into that.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:05
That's actually hilarious, my resume, I think… It literally says I use Postgres before.

[jadecuster] 12:19:13
Oh… She's such… such a lie.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:13
I'm such a liar, Jesus.

[jadecuster] 12:19:17
That's okay. Unless they're gonna ask you a specific question. I believe in you.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:23
Well, let's called that hard to understand, it's just relational databasing.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:26
It's just like, oh yeah, you map this to this, and these have their relation, and it's like, just, you know, it's not that complex.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:36
But yeah, okay.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:19:39
Next meeting agenda… Wait, so…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:19:44
The 5-minute meeting thing? What's going on with that? Like, for some things.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:47
Well, like, every day. We can just…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:19:50
Are we filling out a Scrum form every day?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:19:53
We should ask JAGS, truthfully. Um, one of us should probably email Jax about that.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:00
Okay.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:01
Um, because I don't see why we would need a Scrum meeting doc every day.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:06
I think would be fine if we just… gave updates, like, hey, this is what I'm doing today, this is what I've done so far.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:12
Oh yeah, in the Slack.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:14
In Slack. And then we can, you know, we can, like, post, like, copy that into our Scrum Doc.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:21
For the week. I don't think we should have a new Scrum Doc for every day, is… my… my idea, but I don't know.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:27
All your team weekly recordings are posted on your Slack channel as links you'll find at the top of your Slack window.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:33
What does that mean? That's what he said in… Slack. He sent a message.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:35
Wait, what?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:42
What a…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:45
Oh, wait, never mind. Team Weekly recordings.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:50
Oh, that he records with us and him. Our co-workers.

[jadecuster] 12:20:53
Yeah, Fridays.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:20:53
Yes, yes, yes.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:20:56
That's weird. Oh, yeah.

[jadecuster] 12:21:08
Was this a Scrum meeting? Should we mark this as a Scrum meeting, just so he doesn't get angry?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:21:13
Nice. I'll email him about it, um…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:21:18
Yeah, because we should follow what JAG says. I do not care about the project anymore, so I just want to get good… I just want to get a good grade.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:21:26
Truthfully.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:21:28
I mean, I just want to make it work, and look nice.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:21:33
Which is equal to getting a good grade, so…

[jadecuster] 12:21:35
Yeah, we need a good portfolio.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:21:36
Oh, yeah.

[jadecuster] 12:21:44
All right, anything else to talk about?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:21:51
That's…

[jadecuster] 12:21:56
Alright, um… So, the GitHub repo's done.

[jadecuster] 12:22:02
My liking. Okay, so the GitHub repo is done, we're about to send the email off to Alark, and…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:22:03
No, you're not.

[jadecuster] 12:22:11
Is someone emailing Jax, or are we just gonna Slack them?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:22:16
Oh, yeah, we can just… let's just Slack him. Yeah, let's Slack him.

[jadecuster] 12:22:20
To redo it in, like… our… I guess, our Slack channel.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:22:26
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and ours.

[jadecuster] 12:22:47
Don't even ask him, like…

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:22:50
Yeah, do we need…

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:22:55
Wait, what? Wait, what?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:22:55
To fill out the template every day. What are we asking him specifically?

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:23:03
Um, if… if it's fine with him, like.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:23:08
For our agile, because instead of filling out the scrum doc every day, yeah, just using.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:23:13
Just pushing updates to the Slack channel. And then we can add that. So, like, instead of a daily scrum doc, we want a weekly Scrum Doc.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:23:21
And then we'll have daily updates. Like, attached to the end, basically.

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:23:25
Is… yeah.

[jadecuster] 12:23:54
Okay, message sent. Um…

[jadecuster] 12:24:02
Go to Friday, then?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:24:06
Four Thursday.

[jadecuster] 12:24:06
Thursday. Thursday? Oh, the… what's it called? Office hours?

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:24:11
I mean, a lark.

[jadecuster] 12:24:16
Alright, see you guys Thursday then.

[Alina Scantlebury] 12:24:21
Bye! Yeah, but we should

[Taiyo Williamson] 12:24:22
At office hours?

[jadecuster] 12:24:23
Yes
