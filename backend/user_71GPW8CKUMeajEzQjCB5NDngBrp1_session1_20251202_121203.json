Let me tell you a bit about what we'll be doing together over the next four weeks.\n\nThis is a 4-week coaching program where we'll meet once a week for four sessions total. Each session happens exactly one week apart, and during our time together, we'll focus on helping you achieve your personal health goals. We'll work on setting goals that really matter to you, create strategies based on what actually works for behavior change, and I'll provide guidance on nutrition and exercise tailored to your needs.\n\nBetween our weekly sessions, you'll be working on your goals independently. I won't be checking in or reaching out between sessions, so you'll want to think about how you'll track your progress and stay accountable to yourself during the week. Then when we meet each week, we'll discuss how things went and adjust as needed.\n\nDo you have any questions about how the program works before we dive in?"

I'm really into coding and working on technical projects\u2014right now I'm building an AI health coaching chatbot and diving deep into systems design and algorithms. When I'm not grinding through coursework or coding, you'll probably find me analyzing fantasy football matchups or strategizing my lineup for the week. I also enjoy staying physically active\u2014whether that's hitting the gym, going for runs around San Francisco, or just exploring the city. I like to balance the screen time with getting outside and moving around. Even with a full course load, I'm always down to learn new things, whether it's a new tech stack, a better workout routine, or just picking up random skills along the way."

Balancing a 4+1 program in computer science is no small feat, and it's impressive that you're building an AI health coaching chatbot on top of everything else. I love that you're intentional about balancing your screen time with staying active and exploring the city.\n\nSince you mentioned you're pretty active and enjoy hitting the gym and going for runs, I'd love to hear more about that. What does your current exercise routine look like\u2014how often are you working out, and what types of activities do you typically do?"

Is that accurate?\n\nThat's quite a bit less than what most people need, especially with your intense schedule and all that physical activity. How is that affecting you day to day?"

Getting only 3 to 4 hours of sleep while juggling a demanding academic program, building projects, and working out five days a week is incredibly tough on your body and mind. It makes total sense that you're feeling very tired.\n\nLet me ask you this\u2014what are your current eating habits like throughout the day? Are you eating regular meals, and what does a typical day of eating look like for you?"

Having that solid foundation with protein, vegetables, and carbs at each meal is definitely working in your favor, especially with how active you are.\n\nNow I'm curious\u2014outside of all the coding, coursework, gym time, and sports, what do you like to do in your free time when you just want to relax or have fun?"

I want to help you make this goal as clear and achievable as possible so you can actually track your progress.\n\nRight now your goal is to get more sleep per night, but let's make it more specific. How many hours of sleep per night are you aiming for, and how many nights per week do you want to hit that target over the next week?"

I love that you're thinking about the routine aspect too, because that consistency can really help your body adjust.\n\nJust to make sure I understand correctly, when you say every night, do you mean all 7 nights of the week, or are you thinking of a specific number of nights per week to start with, like 5 or 6 nights?"

That gives you room to learn what works and adjust as you go.\n\nLet me make sure I've got your goal right: You want to sleep from 11pm to 7am for 3 nights this coming week, with the aim of doing this consistently every night by the end of the four-week program.

What do you think will be your biggest challenge in sticking to that 11pm bedtime, especially given that you mentioned spending 2 to 4 hours longer than you should on social media?"

Your goal is to sleep from 11pm to 7am for 3 nights this week, working toward making that consistent every night by the end of our four weeks together. You're feeling pretty confident at an 8 out of 10, and you'll be tracking your progress using reminders and routines in your clock and calendar apps.\n\nI'm excited to hear how your first week goes. Remember to track your progress using those reminders you set up. See you next week at Session 2!"
