11:00:21 Coach: Okay. Hello. How are you?

11:00:21 Participant: Good, how's it going today? Tired, but good. Long week.

11:00:31 Coach: It's been a long week. I think I've had some difficult nights in a row, and it's impacting, yeah I can't talk right. What do they call it, like sleep deprivation.

11:00:46 Participant: Yeah, yeah, that a little bit. Yeah. How are you?

11:00:54 Coach: Yeah. Good, good. It's, I'm excited that it's Thursday. Tomorrow is Friday, I know. Yeah, I'm off from work this morning and tomorrow morning. Oh yeah. So I'm excited that I get some time to just focus on my project and then some research work that needs to get done. But I'm really here to check in about you. So how was your goal this last week? How did you do?

11:01:26 Participant: Really well. I'm, I'm, I actually overdid it, meaning that it was 20 minutes minimum. And then on a couple of occasions, I think twice in the past week, I was able to do more. I'm just because you know, I felt like it. Um, but I think that the strategy to have a plan A in the morning and then if it didn't happen you know have a plan B in the afternoon, worked really really well, really really well because before the challenge was I was aiming for all or nothing. I can do it today, I'll do it later and that later never happened. And now if it doesn't happen organically in the morning, I have another chance. I do. And it's worked really well. So I am very happy.

11:02:32 Coach: Good. I'm good. So on a scale of one to 10, how are you doing at meeting your goal?

11:02:44 Participant: 10.

11:02:44 Coach: Like, you mentioned that you've had some difficult nights. Do you think they're associated with stress, and if so, like, what has been your stress level this week or is it something else?

11:02:57 Participant: It could be stress, um, but I do so many things throughout my day to make sure that I keep you know myself balanced and grounded. But I'm sure that, you know, a month from graduation, that has a certain impact. However, it was related to my diabetes. I had a night where I had a hypoglycemia at 1am, and usually I fix it you know I wake up, fix it with some sugar, wait an hour, because that's what I need to do in order to make sure that it's going in the right direction. Um, and after an hour it was 2:30, I was at a right level to go back to bed and sleep, but for some reason my body was still feeling, when I have symptoms, physical symptoms when I have a low. And these physical symptoms were not going away, which is very odd. After an hour for me to be at the right range and still feel not good. So that kept me up all night. And I think I over caffeinated the next day, and I couldn't fall asleep until 1am. So yeah, that has been kind of, it could be stress, but I think it was more health than anything else.

11:04:41 Coach: And what would you say was your stress level this last week on a scale of one to 10?

11:04:53 Participant: Seven because I had, last week, life took over. And I wasn't able to achieve all the goals that I had set up for that week. Which means that I'm working on getting back on track, which usually takes time for me to get back on track. Just because I feel behind. And so that's creating stress. So I would say that I did my best to, you know, keep myself grounded but I was, yeah stress was there so seven.

11:05:24 Coach: Yeah, yeah. So you're feeling that you're sort of having to play catch up at this point, with some of the things that you wanted to do last week. Yeah. And what else are you hoping to be able to check in about today, or what do you want to focus on for this week?

11:05:33 Participant: I was thinking about that. I'm definitely continuing with the meditation because that has helped me tremendously. And, you know, giving myself like okay I can do it, I can, you know, stay on track and all these things. But I've been thinking about if I want to focus on food or, as we discussed last time, if I wanted to go, you know, focus on more plant based meals.

11:06:21 Coach: As I did have that note that you wanted to consider food for the next one. I think I had mentioned, you wanted to start. I sent you something to start thinking about the types of fruits and vegetables that you might want to include for your next goal. Yeah, we could do something around that or if you have something else in mind it's whatever you decide to do.

11:06:37 Participant: Right, right. And the thing is I've been so tired. In the past couple of days and I'm wondering, in the last 10 minutes of my thinking, um, I thought about why not create a new strategy around sleep, to make sure that I get quality sleep. I feel like it's out of my control.

11:07:07 Coach: I wanted to ask you about that because I know you mentioned that the reason why you weren't able to sleep was because of the symptoms of hypoglycemia. What are some things that maybe can help you to ensure that that hypoglycemia doesn't happen so that then you're able to get a good night's sleep?

11:07:28 Participant: That's what I'm wondering about. No yeah no it's a great, it's a great question and I, I eat early enough so that by the time that I go to bed, I don't have any acting rapid insulin in my system, which, that is most likely 90% the reason why I experience hypoglycemia when I'm sleeping. Um. Another reason could be I didn't have enough of a big meal at dinner because I wasn't hungry. And my long acting insulin kicks in and continues to work because it works 24 hours, and that's the second reason why I may have a hypoglycemia. Like I cannot go too long without enough sugars in my system. So it's the balance between the two. And, you know, I've had this for five years and oh my goodness, I've played trial and error. And I still, you know once in a while have the hypo at night, and that feels very much outside of my control. Because you know like it's like first, the first strategy is have the dinner at the same time every night which I do. Another strategy is have the same meal, you know, the same combination, so I play with the same meal. It's like protein, carbs, you know, vegetables, it looks like there's, are very boring, they look all the same. I mean, you know, in terms of macros. They're exciting because I cook so, um, and then the last thing is you know check your sugars before going to bed. Two hours before going to bed and before, right before, you know, turning the lights off. And if I'm at the right level there's nothing I need to do. I sometimes have the intuition to have an extra piece of sugar before going to bed. If I know that my meal was too small. But sometimes, everything is, you know, sort of normal, and I still do that. So I think the strategy is there.

11:09:47 Coach: So, and in terms of going back and thinking about improving or working on sleep because I know that's what you brought up earlier, how do I develop a better like sleeping routine. What do you think would help you, given the situation with the hypoglycemia and that that may or may not happen?

11:09:59 Participant: Yeah, that's a great question. Um, so, besides that, you know, outside of that, what I meant with better sleeping schedule. I read about this term not too long ago and I thought it was very very good and really embodied what I sometimes do. It's called sleep revenge.

11:10:28 Coach: Oh, I have not heard of that.

11:10:28 Participant: Yeah, it's really cool, it's really cool, it's really cool because sleep revenge is when you know you had a very long day, and there was lots to do, lots of work and studying and calls and zooms and errands and groceries and you've been running the entire day, non stop, and you want some me time. And you get to dinner, you're like, Okay, I don't care. I'm going to watch something on Netflix right, but instead of, you know, keeping it and saying at 10pm Okay, done, I've done my half an hour of Netflix thing and going to bed. You're like, no, I had a crappy day or had a really long day, and I really want to take revenge. Right. I want to take revenge on this day and have this, you know, full three hours of binge watching. So that's sleep revenge.

11:11:33 Coach: Wow. Yeah, when you're taking, you know you're taking hours from your hours of sleep, to make up for you know you had a running day like a crazy day.

11:11:48 Coach: And what exactly do you have in mind to do for your plan that might include that?

11:11:55 Participant: I was wondering if I'm finding different, and how do you say, new ways to unwind at the end of the day, that don't include watching Netflix. Netflix has this awful thing where it goes on to the next thing. You know it has this awful thing where it goes on to the next thing. So unless you stop it, it just continues. Yeah, that's how they get you.

11:12:32 Coach: And I'm wondering if I could find something that would, you know, is there a way to turn that off?

11:12:43 Participant: I don't know, good question. I don't know, because I'm assuming it's a setting right that you can. I don't know, no I need to check. Yeah, I never thought about it.

11:13:00 Coach: I will tell you that personally, I don't have Netflix, for that same reason. And I applaud you. I tend to just watch and sit on the couch and not do anything else. My sister has an account. My brother has an account but they will, like on purpose will not share their account with me because they know me. Okay. I will binge that account. Yeah. And they told me, we would share with you, but we know you need to be productive.

11:13:39 Participant: Yeah, wise family. No, it's so easy to turn it on, you know. And, yeah, it's, I do need to. What I do get from Netflix, by the way, I do get something positive. Right. I get, which I could get so many other ways, but I get the disconnect. So I want to focus on how can I disconnect without, you know, like, while being mindful.

11:14:12 Coach: What would you suggest would be a good like routine? I mean I think that watching something is completely fine and but I do get the sense that you want to make sure that you're also setting a specific time for it. And that you stick to that. So I think it should be fine, I don't see why that's not okay. And that's a good way to disconnect and not think about anything else. Your mind is distracted. Because I mean you're already doing meditation and I feel it's a different type of disconnecting. Yes, and you're looking for something that's a little bit different to help you just relax and not worry about everything else that's been going on during the day.

11:14:54 Participant: Exactly because I love reading. I love reading, and the experience of reading before going to bed is always disappointing. I never remember what I read and I don't go, it's my mind is like I'm so tired by the time I get to the book that it's not fulfilling. It's not a fulfilling experience because I'm still stuck in my head, not really paying attention to what I'm reading. Um, so I tried that. So you're saying, I could continue doing the Netflix, same thing, or watching some TV. But, setting a time.

11:15:36 Coach: Yes. Okay, like we do for meditation. You meditate for 20 minutes for example, you did that before. So thinking of yes I'll watch. If there's like a specific show that you want to watch. I would say look at how long the episodes are and like tell yourself, I will watch like one episode. But I mean, it's going to require willpower, right? Stick to that time frame and I would say also look into the idea of, see if there is a way to turn off that auto play. I'm checking that out.

11:16:17 Participant: I agree, I agree. The thing is, yeah I need to see what I'm watching and see what an episode is because yesterday, for example, it was already midnight by the time. I was like only one episode, that was, that was my mindset. Um, but I wasn't feeling tired. That's also the other thing right, I wasn't feeling tired. By the time the episode ended, which is why I was like I'm not tired, I might as well just, just watch another one.

11:16:54 Coach: Yeah, that's not a good idea.

11:16:58 Participant: And we're just being real. I love it. I just love watching your face and realizing that it's not very real. I keep it real. Yeah.

11:17:16 Coach: Do you have, do you have something in mind that you can just watch for one episode or it's something that you need to still kind of look into?

11:17:35 Participant: No, I need to look into it. I tried something new that wasn't at all, because the thing is also. I need to find the show. And I'm looking for a show or documentary, something that I'm not depressed at the end. I'm sorry but documentaries on climate and environment. So I keep those documentaries for the weekend in the afternoon, so that I can you know do something else afterwards. I'm looking for something that is uplifting, you know, not too sad. I don't want to go to bed and feel sad about what I watched. I don't watch the news for example at night. I don't watch horror things or anything so I'm looking for something that could just do that you know disconnect for half an hour would be great.

11:18:18 Coach: Maybe just even if it's a comedy, something that will make you laugh.

11:18:25 Participant: Yeah, exactly. And how many nights, do you want to do this or how many days of the week do you want to do this?

11:18:46 Participant: Good question. Good question because I don't always turn it on, I just turn it on on you know when I have a long day, I really that that's my that's my go to. Um, how often do you have long days during the week? Is it like once a week thing, twice a week?

11:19:07 Coach: Oh, long days. I feel like half of the week are long days and the other half are, you know, more, more balanced, particularly lately, where, you know, it's the end of the semester and I'm doing this TA. So that's, and the thesis, and the extra class that I have on sustainability and looking for jobs. These things lately I've had more long days. I think that's what's been going on.

11:19:36 Coach: Yeah. If you had to choose an amount of days to do it for this week. How many days do you think would be feasible?

11:19:46 Participant: I think four. I think four days also allows me to be in bed, and check you know what's the direction of my glucose.

11:20:06 Coach: Do you know the length of time that you want to spend?

11:20:06 Participant: I would, I would want ideally less than an hour. Yeah, yeah, basically.

11:20:17 Coach: And how confident do you feel about being able to do this goal for this upcoming week?

11:20:28 Participant: Um, I never tried it. Um, so I think that it makes sense, it's like a goal that makes sense. So, I will want to make my best try and the thing is the part where, you know, I know I'll get tempted to do more than an hour. I think it's six out of 10.

11:20:55 Coach: Okay. And do you think the amount of time is what is making it a six confidence level, or how confident are you being able to stick to it?

11:21:08 Participant: Um, well I don't want to do more than an hour, but you know at the end of the day, your brain is not really the thing that is the most, like the willpower is no longer there. At the end of the day it feels like anything that is, you know, like the temptation gets bigger, to like, it's fine I'll just do one more. That's a good question. I think I'm going to trip on the one hour. But also, I like the challenge. So.

11:21:48 Coach: I want to make sure that you succeed so that's sort of where my question comes from. When it comes to the confidence level that you're telling me that your confidence level is six, which tells me you're thinking about it. There's something that makes you unsure, because you foresee that something might get in the way of doing it.

11:22:07 Participant: It's the time, it's the less than an hour time, because sometimes an episode is, you know, 40 minutes, and if I do get tempted to watch the second one, I already failed the goal of less than an hour. And I know that if it's, these are like episodes, I do have the tendency. Um, I do have the tendency to watch, to do things and I do most things in twos or threes, not episodes but, you know, episodes are usually two. So if it's over 30 minutes, I know that I'll be above the hour.

11:22:52 Coach: Do you want to extend the amount of time to an hour and a half to give yourself wiggle room? That way if you do want to watch a second one you can, but if you don't have to then you don't have to.

11:23:06 Participant: I like that, I like that. Yeah, I like that. So we'll do up to an hour to an hour and a half.

11:23:17 Coach: Cool. Yeah. How confident would you feel about being able to do that?

11:23:24 Participant: Well no, eight.

11:23:32 Coach: Anything else that you want to work on for this week or that's the main thing that you're just trying to unwind and mentally just turn off your brain, particularly because of how last week went and how you know I'm prepping for next week's coming. I think I like this goal being in place so that I can feel like I'm, you know, in the decision seat, instead of, you know, did you want to do anything around what we discussed last week for the fruits and vegetables or do you want to leave that for next week?

11:24:12 Participant: I think I'll leave it for next week because I'm still playing with it. I've been eating more fruits and vegetables, by the way, thanks to the messages, and I'm trying to figure out a better way to account for them throughout the day. But yeah, yeah, next week.

11:24:32 Coach: Okay, let me. You mentioned the messages so let me ask you a little bit more about those. Which stood out to you this last week?

11:24:47 Participant: My brain is not working, so wait a second. I'll tell you right away. I have one in mind. Oh, yeah, I remember. It's the one I read it and I was already feeling overwhelmed with my day. And it's the one that comes with what can I do to promote social justice and peace in the world. And it comes with like four other bubbles. That text message to me was overwhelming but I laughed at myself as I realized that I was overwhelmed by the message because it was a beautiful message. But then it was like, Oh, what am I going to do to promote that. And it was doing like the whole like Jewish guilt trip, or like, Am I doing enough. So that made me laugh because of my sense of humor and like how I react sometimes very dramatically to good things, and I, if that makes sense. So that one stood out to me. I don't know how but I remember, but that one was the one that stood out to me. Just because like how it was engaging, the questions were great. I opened it, it was already like cramming in the to do list. And it was just thinking, am I promoting anything, and a bit of an existential crisis.

11:26:24 Coach: I can see that happening. I can see that. That message has a lot, a lot in it. I'm glad that it made you laugh though.

11:26:38 Participant: Yes, yeah. No no no no no oh my goodness. The thing is I think I've started asking myself existential questions since I was eight. So there's a point where you just like notice that, you know, like the habit.

11:26:56 Coach: Yeah. So, any other messages that stood out to you this week?

11:27:02 Participant: Honestly that was the funny one. To me, I think that was the one that really stood out to me because of the reaction. I think that would be the number one, and then I love receiving you know good messages around food. I've had such a difficult relationship with food, difficult because of diabetes, you know, diabetes makes everything complicated, so food has you know evolved and changed, and I love seeing positive messages around, you know, food, like, instead of the, you know, things that you find on Instagram for example, don't consume this don't consume that, all these things. I love being reinforced like the good things. So foods are visible and really good for you. So I always enjoy receiving those. Yeah.

11:27:58 Coach: Thank you. Yeah, I think that was definitely our goal with the approach of not telling people what not to do, but giving them options of what is, what can be done. Especially for particularly with like my journey with food. I'm very pro the positive movement around reinforcing good things. So I really like them.

11:28:26 Coach: And any other questions, any other thoughts?

11:28:39 Coach: And we'll check in about how you did with your goal for this week. I will send you a reminder just like I did last time through email with a little summary, and I'm trying to think if there's any resources but I don't think in terms of resources there's anything additional to add today, in the email. Unless I have suggested some shows that you can watch but I don't watch Netflix myself so that would be. I would have to ask people. I would have to ask people, so I could give you some guidance around that. But let me ask because we're part of a team. I can just text them like Hey, is anyone watching anything funny or entertaining on Netflix?

11:29:30 Coach: Those are all my questions for you today. Thank you. And I'm glad that last week went well, for your meditation, or for your goal. I'm hoping that this week you have better sleep and things are okay with the glucose. I was gonna ask you, how often does it happen during the week, and do you have to check in with your provider about it?

11:29:56 Participant: That's a really good question. So, it doesn't happen, it used to happen when I do dramatic change in lifestyle. It goes both directions. Right. And right now, I would say that the last hypo I had before the one I experienced this week was more than a month ago, so that's very good. That's very very good news. They used to happen more often, more frequently. Because I tried so many different things. But now I have been on a good routine, and following a very similar structure, so that they don't happen often.

11:30:40 Coach: Okay. Yeah, but they do, because, you know, I'm just wondering if it's something you need to check in with your provider about maybe because I remember you mentioned the long lasting insulin, like, does that need to be adjusted or anything?

11:30:59 Participant: Thank you, thank you. I actually, I had to adjust it. And because I was going through a lot of hypers which is the other side of the thing. And I had to adjust it in order to correct that so that has been corrected. I'm a little bit of a perfectionist so if I don't see that, you know, throughout the day I tend to take more insulin. In order to make sure that I stay in range. And that's exactly, exactly. Yeah, thank you thank you thank you for checking in. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Skipping meals is not a good thing. Not even skipping meals sometimes is you know you plan that you would have dinner ready by seven and it's ready by eight, and that extra hour just affects everything.

11:31:56 Coach: Yeah, it's the way our body works, I mean specifically for you because of the way that insulin works in your body. It's an external, yeah, solution that you have to put in your body and then it takes time to process. And then if it's not, if you don't have food by a certain time then now you have it in your bloodstream, doing its thing.

11:32:24 Participant: Yeah, exactly.

11:32:25 Coach: Yeah, you got this. I mean, if it's something that happens rarely, and you have a pretty good handle of it and I think you do.

11:32:42 Participant: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.

11:32:41 Coach: Take care. Have a good night. Good weekend.
