11:01:36 Coach: Hi, I hope there's no connection issues. Well thank you for joining me this morning, Sarah. My name is Erica, and I will be your health coach for the next four weeks. I'll start by providing you a quick introduction about the program itself and then we can go into setting goals for your health, working on your health goals. How does that sound?

11:02:04 Participant: Perfect, thank you so much. Thank you.

11:02:14 Coach: So one of the things we should close some of these windows so I can have more space. So as you've noticed, the EXAMEN intervention is sort of a two part project. One aspect is the health and wellness text messages, which you are receiving already, and you should be getting those daily. And the second part of it is the health coaching so meeting one on one with me. My role as your health coach will be meeting once a week for at least 20 minutes. If we need more time then we can definitely work that out. I usually schedule each session for 30 minutes just in case anything comes up. During that time, we'll check in about the daily text messages, what your thoughts have been on them, if any of them have motivated you to do any of the activities or suggestions. We'll talk about weekly goals that we're going to set. And I'll tell you a bit more about that later. And I'll also be asking you about your stress level and sort of how stressed you feel from week to week, and I will be following up with you through text messages in between our sessions just to see how things are going and get an idea of how you're progressing. If at any point there's questions or topics that come up that I feel are outside of my scope of expertise as a health coach, I will let you know and that way I can help you to get connected to appropriate resources. So this is a research study, yes, as you might have noticed with all the paperwork that you had to fill out. Thank you so much for doing that. However, while we're going to collect data, any specific conversations will be kept confidential and any data that we do gather or transcripts will be de-identified, so they won't be associated with your name. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. By the end of the four weeks, we do hope that you gain skills around problem solving, goal setting as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual, your mental and your physical health. So I really want to thank you for taking the time to participate in this program. Your participation will really help us to be able to understand how we can better support Latino students at USF and whether we can actually scale this program to a larger number of students. Do you have any questions before we continue?

11:04:47 Participant: No, I'm really excited and I, when I received the email I thought, yes this is exactly what the community at USF needs, you know, particularly women. We need this kind of space so I'm very happy.

11:05:16 Coach: I'm glad that you see it that way and that you saw it as an opportunity to participate in something that can create long lasting impact for our community. So before I jump into the messages themselves, I do want to ask you, tell me a little bit more about yourself, and also what are you hoping to check in about today? What are some of the focuses that you want to have this week and as we move forward? What are your thoughts?

11:05:41 Participant: So a little bit about myself. I'm finishing my master's degree right now in environmental management. And that's my second degree at USF. My first one was a Bachelor's in international studies. I'm right now, you know, I'm finishing this masters and wondering where I should go work wise, career wise, more education. So, you know, I can see the end of the chapter and the stress levels are increasing, because, um, well on the one hand I need to make sure that the thesis is done and ready in the next month. So I was diagnosed with diabetes type one, that was six years ago already. And it has an impact on, you know, well, how much I care, how much I think about my health on a daily basis. And so I've learned a lot, but there are some areas where consistency is missing. So let's say that I feel fine. I mean, you know, good days, oh I don't need these tools. And then when everything comes up, and I think, oh, when was the last time I took 20 minutes to meditate or, you know, so it's this game of you know getting into the flow and out of the flow, and I think we all do that cycle. And so what I really hope to achieve, you know, in these next four weeks is this consistency, right? To have, to establish a routine and a routine of non-negotiables because, you know, we don't think about oh let's get a shower, let's eat. But, hey let's check in with myself, where am I at. What really attracted me in the language that you used as part of the research, you know, the questions. The first questions that I received was about the spiritual, and I thought that was really interesting because I'm constantly thinking about my health and what I eat and how much I move and if I you know had enough exercise. But the spiritual side is so important to me and somehow it just went into, you know, that section of like, oh, perhaps it is the full moon, I remember, reconnect. Right, yeah. You get the picture.

11:08:41 Coach: Now I totally get it. I actually think it's something that especially as Latina women we tend to be very conflicted about. Either we are at one extreme of spirituality or at the other. And I really want to make sure that during this program, our goal is not really to move you to one extreme or the other. It's really to find a middle ground that helps you stay grounded and that helps your well being. And so the idea of EXAMEN itself comes from like the Jesuit tradition to stop and reflect on where we are and where we want to go, and also how do we impact the world around us as human beings right? And being mindful and present, but also how do we help our community at the same time in those areas. So I think you do bring up a great point that at times, spirituality sort of just gets left behind. And it's not necessarily a bad thing. There's a lot of other things that we want to focus on, but learning to maybe weave it into the things that we do on a daily basis can really help us to sort of keep it all together, right?

11:10:01 Participant: I agree, I agree. Absolutely. Beautifully said.

11:10:10 Coach: Okay, so that's good. So you mentioned a little bit about stress already. So if you had to rate your stress level for this week that you just had on a scale of one, not stressed, to 10, very stressed, how would you, what number would you give it?

11:10:29 Participant: All those questions with numbers are the most difficult to answer, because I think it's a flow, right, it's a flow of in and out. I think there are parts of the day where I feel more stress than others. You know, typically I'm not going to be stressed in the morning. I wake up and I do my thing so I get into, you know, the mindset of what needs to be done. But I would say that I have moments in the day where I have peaks of stress, and those could be categorized you know between seven and 10. And then I have a couple of moments in the day, which are fewer, but I do have moments where I'm 100% present and in the moment. And I would say that perhaps the lowest, you know, is three in those times of peaceful moments. And typically that's when I'm taking my time to go on a walk outside or calling my girlfriend, you know, and catch up with her. So I would say there's a variation. The average, I'm rather stressed because it's April, I need to finish this thesis. So I would give it an average of six or seven.

11:11:57 Coach: I think I was going to ask you, I was getting to that, what would be your average. So you get right to it. So in a similar question would be, I know you mentioned that you have goals that you set for yourself already, so I guess I'm thinking of a baseline. The current goals that you have for yourself, if you also had to give them an average of how well you're doing meeting those goals on a scale of one to 10, what would you give it?

11:12:29 Participant: So I would say that lately, my focus has been on getting the right amount of exercise. It has been easier just because you know Spring is coming, and honestly, for me it makes it easier to see the sun, and to be able to step out. So I would say that on the exercise goal I've been, you know, between eight and 10. In the past three weeks I've been really excellent at keeping you know like my one hour of walking out, whether it may be walking or pilates or weights. So that has been really really consistent and positive. Then meditation comes in and out. And it's very important to me. It's not something that I want to say that I do, you know, it's something that for me I know it keeps me grounded and I know how important it is to me. So I would say that lately, I would say perhaps I meditate once or twice a week for 20 minutes. I would give it a four, you know, like that's definitely not as often as I would want to be. I really want to make it more of a daily practice and not a you know weekly happening.

11:13:56 Participant: And then the third one has been being more mindful of what I eat because when I'm stressed, I do tend to overeat. And not bad things. I mean, there's nothing bad or good, but I'm diabetic. So, you know, it's I've been making sure that I've been, over eating. In the past two weeks I've been more mindful when I eat. I you know try not to get too distracted or just serve myself and then if I'm still hungry perhaps go for a second, instead of like piling up the food and things like that, you know. But I would say it has been better. Six, you know. For some reason on the weekends instead of like a cheat meal, it becomes a cheat weekend. So those would have been the three, I think, goals, yeah.

11:15:17 Coach: So in thinking about this upcoming week, and in setting goals, our goal is going to be to set up a SMART goal. So these are goals that are going to be as I mentioned Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant because we want to make sure that you're able to do it, and also Time-bound so there will be a time associated with it. So for example, today we're meeting on a Thursday. How does next Thursday look for you at this time?

11:15:32 Participant: Perfect.

11:15:32 Coach: So my goal is that we could just have a recurrent meeting on Thursdays at 11. That way every week we can check in and see how you're doing with your goals. So you mentioned that you're working on quite a few things. Which of those would you want to place more of an emphasis for this week?

11:15:56 Participant: Meditation.

11:15:56 Coach: Okay, yeah. And what do you, what exactly do you want to do with it? Like how much time, how many days?

11:16:03 Participant: So I want to make it a daily, a daily habit. And I'm comfortable with 20 mins. Usually 20 it's, you know, not I built the muscle to get to 20. I would say that I could do more, but in order for it to happen on a daily basis I would rather you know go with the secure 20 rather than say more.

11:16:36 Coach: Is that like Monday through Friday? Are you also thinking Saturday and Sunday?

11:16:40 Participant: I'm also thinking about, yeah, thank you. I'm also thinking about Saturday and Sunday. Okay.

11:16:54 Coach: And how will you measure your progress for this?

11:16:59 Participant: That's a great question. I was thinking about that. And I'm not sure. In the past, I have used my phone to send me a reminder, time to meditate or something like that. And I've also worked with a piece of paper where I just cross off when I do it. I don't know if there's another way to make sure, you know, make sure. Is there any other suggestion that perhaps you may have?

11:17:34 Coach: That's typically what, do you use for the meditation? Do you just do it by yourself? Do you use an app? Do you go online and find videos?

11:17:50 Participant: I've done all the above, done by myself. It really depends. If I'm having a day where I cannot find my quiet, I do need guided, and that's where I usually use either an app or a YouTube video. I have a couple of favorites that I use. But if I feel, you know, rather calm, I'll skip the guided and I'll just breathe through it.

11:18:13 Coach: That is great because I was going to say if you tend to use guided, then there's apps that the app itself, you know, will send you reminders about hey it's time to meditate, and you can set that on it. I mean I typically go with the things that I'm going to see every day and they will remind me to do them every day, whether it's putting a post-it note somewhere. The first thing I tend to look at in the morning is my phone, so having a like a morning reminder like hey today you're going to meditate. Yeah, think of like visual things that you see on a regular basis that will help you remember. Okay, this is what I need to do. The other part I was going to ask was what time of the day do you want to do this?

11:18:59 Participant: And I used to do, I used to have a 4pm, you know, like that was 4pm was my meditation time. I'm really hungry for a snack, which, you know, and again I stop thinking about the snack during the meditation so I'm just gonna have a snack and then meditation, perhaps.

11:19:27 Coach: Well, that's a way to work on our habits, is to associate them with things that we do on a regular basis. Yeah, you might want to do, maybe you want to have this snack and then you do the meditation, you know it could be that.

11:19:50 Participant: That's a really good, that's a really good idea. I'm gonna write it here, just so I remember. And you said associate it with something that I'm already doing on a daily basis. Okay.

11:19:58 Coach: And I'm just thinking as a type one diabetic, I know that you probably eat very regularly because you need to maintain your blood sugar at a constant level. Yeah, so it might be a good idea to associate it with after a meal. And I suggest after a meal because if you do it before you're hungry, like you said, you might be thinking about this snack and it might distract you from your meditation.

11:20:23 Participant: No, that's, that's actually, I don't know how, yeah, that's great. I'm happy we're talking about it. Yeah, really, really good idea.

11:20:39 Coach: That's perfect. Sometimes it's there, we just need to talk it out.

11:20:42 Participant: No, I love it, I love it. It just makes so much sense. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

11:20:48 Coach: For this week you will practice 20 minutes of meditation, seven days a week. You can use your phone as a reminder, and you'll do this after your afternoon snack. And if you have to give yourself a confidence level of being able to do this on that scale of one to 10, how confident do you feel that you can do this? This goal this upcoming week?

11:21:22 Participant: It's pretty good, right. I think it's good. Yeah.

11:21:33 Coach: So you said an eight. Okay, now I think you have all the components. The only thing I would advise you to think about is, let's say something comes up on one day of the week or one day of the weekend. What's going to be your backup plan for that? Because I do want you to think about having some wiggle room just in case things come up.

11:21:50 Participant: That's it. And that was my next question because I was thinking, that's the only reason why, yeah I agree, I agree, I agree that's a really good question. Well, there are two things. Either I start the day, and suddenly you know in the mid morning, I know that something will come in the way of 4pm, but I'll have to answer a call or I'll have to be, you know, I don't know, do something, an errand, right. And my tendency has been to say okay well no problem, I'll just push it. But that tendency to say I'll just push it, that doesn't happen. And then we're, you know, oh I didn't do it. And I remember at 10pm and all these things. So I'm wondering when I know that it's going to get, you know, that 4pm it's not going to work with my day schedule. What would you suggest? Should I just do it, I don't know, set another time like a plan B time?

11:22:57 Coach: What I would actually recommend is that you actually start with five days. That way you have wiggle room. And as you see it becoming consistent, you can add more days. Okay. And if you want to keep the seven days, then I would say definitely have a backup plan of if I'm not able to do it by 4pm, this other time will be my next time to do it, maybe after dinner instead. Yeah. And if you're finding that evenings are tough, I would recommend maybe after breakfast in the morning. Because think of the day. Think of your day and what time of it is more flexible to allow you to have 20 minutes aside for meditation.

11:23:48 Participant: Yeah, I love that. And I think I think SMART goals are things that we use to gradually add on things. And I sense that you just want to go full in, especially because you're familiar with meditation and you've been practicing. I'm not too concerned and also you gave me a really high confidence level. But I do want to just kind of give you those insights.

11:24:23 Participant: No, absolutely, and I'm trying to think about, because I used to do it at 4pm, and I really do like the idea of it being after, you know, in this case it's the afternoon snack but I do have, you know, in the morning, that's a time where I actually get flexible time in the morning more than in the afternoon. Because my schedule is you know like zoom meetings and make sure that you know I advise my thesis etc etc. So I'm tempted to say, instead of having it at 4pm, having it at 10am. And then days that it doesn't work can be having it at 4pm.

11:25:11 Coach: There you go. Yeah, I think that's a great plan. Okay. Perfect, thank you thank you thank you.

11:25:27 Coach: And I love that we were talking about, you know, flexibility because I mean a lot of life is planning. And that's the part of problem solving that we talk about. When we know something might come up, or when we start to realize something might be coming up. What am I going to do, how am I going to solve this situation? Yeah, I think you're on a very good path. So we've covered our goal. I'll send you a reminder about it at the end of our session or before the end of the day, you should get an email that has a summary of your goal. And do you need additional resources or videos about meditation or do you have a good amount of resources for that already? Because you mentioned you have a few favorite ones.

11:26:19 Participant: I do, I do, but if you have anything handy, I mean I'm always curious to discover. But I do, but I'm welcoming any resources that you may have. Especially I use YouTube to find like videos. I just have the guided sound or anything that has like a background, relaxing calm music that will help. I do use an application most of the time because I do need that guided meditation. Yeah, not much of a guided meditation by myself. Like I'm using Calm right now. Yeah.

11:27:01 Coach: Yeah, that's the one that I've been using for some time now and I like it because it always tracks like how long I've meditated for and yeah, kind of like gives me a record. Have you given Headspace a try?

11:27:14 Participant: I tried, I know about Calm. I tried three other ones. Headspace at some point. I've tried Headspace, I really like Headspace, and my employer was providing us a free membership, but it ended. So then, you know, getting on that subscription I did the free trial. Yeah, but I like Calm and Calm right now I have a free membership again through, this time I think my insurance provides it.

11:27:41 Coach: Oh wonderful, so I would actually mention if you have health insurance, you should check what kind of apps they're offering right now because especially with the pandemic and everything that's going on, they're really focusing on ensuring that we're maintaining our mental well being. And they might have resources for you.

11:28:05 Participant: Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to check. I did not know. So yeah, my provider is offering, I think it's a year subscription to Calm.

11:28:19 Coach: Oh wow. That's really important. That's wonderful. Thank you for mentioning. Okay. So in thinking about some of the overall as you're thinking of your health journey and your health goals. What would you say have been some of your successes and what are you, you sort of mentioned a little bit about the challenges that you're currently facing with keeping it consistent. But is there something else that you wanted to add around them?

11:28:54 Participant: No, I think that, you know, every year I get I think more aligned with what works with me, and I'm, you know, keeping myself honest. I'm no longer trying to follow, you know, the trends and what people are doing, just trying to find what you know feels good. So it's a journey, you know, I'm always trying something new. But yeah, I don't know if that answers your question. I'm very curious to discover and find new ways, you know.

11:29:31 Coach: And I get the sense that you're already very aware of how important health is, especially like having a chronic condition, something that you have to manage every single day. Earlier, at the beginning of the conversation you mentioned, I forget about these tools, so you understand that there's a set of tools that we need to have in order to manage our health and our well being. And just being aware of when we need those, and which ones we need I think it's very essential and you're very aware of that so I'm glad to see that. Now we just got to get you to put them into practice. Yeah. And so in thinking about the text messages that you've received so far, were there any messages that stood out to you this week?

11:30:28 Participant: I think that the one that stood out to me was the reminder to eat more vegetables, and it stood out to me because it was playful, you know. I remember growing up being told that we needed to eat more fruits and vegetables. And to me, I mean, seriously, I can tell if you know I go a week focusing on increasing the amount of vegetables. I can feel it. I don't know if this is what you feel, a different type of energy, right. So it was playful and it was a really good reminder, because it's not the go-to. I don't know, you know, growing up with, you know, my family, in our culture, it's not the focus. Yeah, it's more for decoration. Exactly. A little thing you know. Um, and so I really like that reminder because it's done right. Of course increase your amount of vegetables and fruit, but it was a really good reminder because I do need more support with that, like reminding myself to include more vegetables in all of my meals and not just, you know, that extra salad or that extra tomato. So that was a really good one.

11:31:56 Coach: And as we're thinking about next week, you can start to think, is that something you want to incorporate, and we can build a goal around that next week. I do want you to focus on the meditation this week, you know, that goal. And then we can add a little bit more.

11:32:13 Participant: That will be, that'll be wonderful because I did write the first one was like daily meditation, and then it has plant based. So I would love that. Okay, great.

11:32:26 Coach: Well those are all the questions I have for you today. Is there anything else that you wanted to bring up?

11:32:32 Participant: No that's wonderful. I love the plan that we have for the week to come and I'm excited.

11:32:41 Coach: Perfect. Well, I think you set a great goal for this week. I will follow up with you during the week to see how you're doing. And I'll send you a summary of what we discussed today. 

11:32:51 Participant: Thank you, Erica, thank you so much for today.

11:33:13 Coach: I'll send you a calendar invite for the remaining sessions. If at any point you need to change the time for any of them just let me know and we can figure it out.
