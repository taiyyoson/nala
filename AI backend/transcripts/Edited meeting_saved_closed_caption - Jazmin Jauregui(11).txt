19:16:27 Participant: Hello.

19:16:28 Coach: Hi. Hey, I just texted you, so you can ignore that message.

19:16:35 Participant: Yeah, sorry it took me like... it takes me time sometimes to find like the emails and then to figure out which one is yours.

19:16:42 Coach: Oh yeah, no worries. I just, yeah sometimes the Google Calendar Zoom link seems kind of hidden, so I texted it over to you but you're on here so just ignore that message and it's nice to see you. So, I'll just like... Hi my name is Jasmine and thank you so much for joining me. I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks. And I'll be giving you a kind of like a quick little introduction and then we're going to transition to like the health coaching part. Does that sound okay?

19:17:19 Participant: Yeah, that sounds good.

19:17:22 Coach: Okay, cool. So firstly, our program is a two part intervention. One aspect is the health and wellness text messages which you should have started receiving.

19:17:33 Participant: Okay.

19:17:34 Coach: And then the second aspect is the health coaching, which is what we're doing now. And my role as your health coach... we'll meet about once a week for about 20 minutes. I'm open to meeting a little longer, and so if that happens just, or if you're interested, let me know and we can adjust our time. But during this time we'll check in about the daily text messages, your weekly health goal, and your stress level. So, in addition to like our Zoom sessions, I'll text you just to check in about how you're doing in meeting your health goal and if you need any additional support. With that being said, if any questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope or expertise, I'll let you know about the limitations in my knowledge, and then can help you get connected to the appropriate resource. So one example of this could be like, maybe you're interested in pursuing therapy as part of like your mental health goal. Unfortunately, I'm not a therapist. So, I'll let you know like, hey, I'd like to provide the support but it's outside of my role, but there's CAPS here to help you. And then just slightly transitioning to, like, this being a research study, we will be collecting data, but our specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be de-identified, meaning your name will not be associated with, like the notes that I take, it's all kind of scattered. So hopefully you feel comfortable with that. And also just share as much or as little as you'd like. Don't feel obligated to share more than you're comfortable with. But overall, by the end of the four weeks we hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting specifically as a way to feel empowered to manage your spiritual, mental and physical health. And then, of course, just thank you so much. We really appreciate your participation. I'm kind of... outside of this, your participation is helping us identify whether this is something students want, or that they need and whether we can offer it at a large scale. So, your participation is helping with all of that.

19:20:12 Participant: Sounds good. Yeah.

19:20:15 Coach: So that's my little introduction, but thank you. That's the end of my introduction. Do you have any questions before we get started? I know, we kind of touched on everything. So, yeah, if any other questions come up, please feel free to ask anything. So, one question that I'll be asking pretty routinely is around the health messages that you're receiving. I know you've only gotten a few but what are your first impressions of them, and have they motivated you towards setting any health goals?

19:21:01 Participant: Yeah, like they're actually pretty helpful especially because you know sometimes after work you feel stressed, and you kind of... sometimes it's easier to just kind of like lay around and do nothing but then it kind of like doesn't help alleviate the stress as much, especially because I'm not really an energetic person. So I appreciate it when I got the message about, "oh do at least 30 minutes of working out" and I'm like, "Yeah, I probably could go for a jog or do something to get myself moving." It's just good little reminders, especially like with the fruits and vegetables because I have no problem eating a lot of fruit, it's the vegetables that are a little bit harder just because they're not as sweet. So it's like, okay, vegetables have to be included.

19:21:58 Coach: Yeah. I think you... I agree with everything you said like feeling stressed and all we want to do is like curl up in bed but we know being physically active can help us manage our stress. So if you're interested, we can definitely develop health goals around that, as well as, like increasing your vegetable intake. I don't want to like overwhelm you and, like, you don't have to do two goals, we can stick to one but these are good starting points, and if they're important to you, then you know you can achieve them. You did talk about stress and I do have a stress question for you. And so on a scale of one to 10, where one is like not stressed and like 10 is like super stressed, what's your stress level like this week?

19:22:57 Participant: It kind of fluctuates between, like, four to like seven, depending on like what I'm doing at work and also like the other things I'm thinking about because I'm trying to also see if I can move back to San Francisco. And so I'm looking at, of course, looking for places but I have to make sure I have a job first to pay for those places. And so I kind of have to juggle that along with I still take like at least a class at USF just to like get my degree out of the way. And then the stress at work is more like I'm... I barely started. So I'm still kind of new at it even though I've been trained but sometimes I come across things that I'm unfamiliar with. And sometimes my coworker is also pretty new like she started in January, but some of the things she hasn't heard about either like the different things I have to order like the scans and then sometimes what the doctor talks about with the patients, I'm unfamiliar with and she's also unfamiliar with so it's kind of like, "oh, who can we ask?" so it's kind of just having to navigate and figure it out eventually.

19:24:22 Coach: Yeah, what do you... what is it that you do?

19:24:24 Participant: I'm a medical scribe so whatever the patient talks about I dictate it, and then whatever the doctor does is their diagnosis, and then he has PhDs under him, and students that are either medical students or student PhDs. And so they'll also have me dictate for them. And I order like scans for people like MRIs, CT, X-ray and then also different labs that people have to do, and in other cases if they have to have different monitoring systems. And then of course ordering medication. A lot of them are like elderly patients and elderly tend to have more health issues. So that's also why it gets pretty busy with orders and stuff like that. And I can anticipate working in the medical field is high stress, especially because right now he's concerned with this third wave that he feels is going to come, and it's going to be with the younger patients. So, so far we have had patients that have symptoms of COVID but he automatically just has them stay in the car, or over the phone. He never brings them into the clinic. So he's like just trying to stay proactive with that. But again, I have to dictate everything and I have to keep track of them.

19:25:54 Coach: Well, you do good work and I can imagine it being stressful. And you also mentioned, wanting to move back to San Francisco or move to San Francisco, where are you currently?

19:26:12 Participant: I'm now back at home in Atascosa, Texas, it's a little bit outside of the city of San Antonio.

19:26:17 Coach: Wow, you're like in Texas. Yeah, that's why when you mentioned, like you mentioned the times my brain was like, "oh, like Central Time Zone" and then I thought about it I was like, "wait," and then I saw that it said "Pacific" in the little thing and I was like, "oh I keep forgetting that I'm not there anymore," because I had gotten so used to being in Pacific time so sometimes when I'm back here I'm like "oh I got time." I think like my first week, being back home from California I had a dental appointment and it was at 10. And it was, I should have been leaving already at that time I was like, "Oh, it's 10 like I'm fine like you know another two more hours" and I was like, "wait, wait, way I'm totally off." Oh this is bad.
 I know, and honestly, it's totally fine. From like our perspective, like, I apologize for not knowing the time zone. We had a participant one time who like they were living in like Spain or something and they were like not getting their text messages and we're like, "why aren't you getting your text messages?" and she's like "oh I'm in Spain," and we're like, "oh okay" so we have to take into account like, you know, those, and the time. So, we need to ask a question on the survey about time zones. And, and you also said you were you taking classes at USF, are you doing undergrad, graduate, what are you studying?

19:28:10 Participant: Oh, this is to finish my undergraduate. Last semester I made a, I made a mistake of not making sure I took enough classes. I thought "oh I'm fine with just these three" because I thought I finished. Turns out I actually still have to take four classes so I missed one class. So I'm taking that one class now which is neurobiology. Yeah, I still have to walk the stage. I just haven't gotten my diploma yet because I need just one class so it's like frustrating but lessons learned.

19:28:40 Coach: Yeah, definitely. Having a good relationship with your advisor and helping them, ensure you're on track. So, are you going into the medical field yourself?

19:28:54 Participant: I want to eventually, yes. I'm gonna have to be taking some extra classes, just to make my GPA more competitive. And then also just to get more of the recommended classes because I want to do DO versus MD, because I like DO more than the MD philosophy. Just DO is about kind of how your whole body is connected. So, versus like MD is kind of like, "oh it hurts in this one area so let's look at only this area," DO is kind of just like, "oh, what is that connected to," like, they tend to ask more about like your mental health because maybe that's affecting something, you know, just like other areas of your body could also be hurting, and it's just not showing up in that area.

19:29:48 Coach: Yeah, so many things are connected to our mental health, like our mental health and our physical health are connected, even though we want to see them as two different things. Well, congratulations on like graduating, like even though you just have this one class it shows you're rocking it, and you're getting that experience that can help you be a good applicant. So, props to you. So, in terms of like this program and how we can like work together, what were your main motivations in participating?

19:30:34 Participant: So, for me, like, it kind of goes tied back to like my freshman year of college. So, you know, when you're a freshman in college I was told like the "college 15" because like you just gained like weight. So like for me like in high school and even as a kid I was never allowed to like eat certain like sugary foods or processed foods because my parents were like, "no, don't eat that" like it was really fresh. So when I finally got to college, I was like, "I can eat this stuff." So I gained a lot of weight, and then the issue was that I was always used to continuously working out because I did sports in high school, and even in middle school. So I realized I didn't have sports to balance out my eating like I did before. So since then it's kind of like, been a journey of just kind of like getting back into shape, like how I was like before. I guess now more recently because I've been getting busier now that I started work and I used to start working like in the past years also after freshman year, it's a little bit harder to maintain like continuously working out because you're tired, you don't feel like waking up so early because you're also tired from classes. And then now it's kind of just like with COVID I feel like more sluggish. Just because everything seems to be going really slowly and everything's all online it's like, it's a little bit harder to get out sometimes. So that's why I wanted to do this because I was like, "Oh, it'd be a good way of just like getting an extra reminder from, like, you know, besides myself just like, do something." That way I can stick with working out continuously because I start doing it and then I have trouble following through with it because then I get tired.

19:32:27 Coach: I wonder too if like how you're saying the current situation, the current status of our world is impacting your energy and motivation or determination to continue with the goal that you've set for yourself. So tell me a little bit about, like, the goal that you did have, for example, you mentioned like you were working out. Like what did that include for you?

19:33:01 Participant: For me, it was just a way to also just get out stress. I'm a very physical person like I have to do something in order to really work out my stress and then also like any anxiety. And so, like my main goal is just to like be more active in general, like whether that's, you know, doing more actual physical working out or you know have a set routine with what I do like certain workouts, or even just to like get more outside and wander around the yard, like my dad. He literally put on his to-do list "walk around" and I'm like "why do you put that?" he's like "because you have to always walk around a little bit." So he literally like gets up from his like workstation and he'll just walk around the whole yard, like a few times and then he'll come back in and go back to typing and it's like "check." Yeah, like when he puts it in there twice. Okay, make sure that he goes multiple times. So I've started recently doing that too, because like you know like it's been... inside sometimes you don't get that natural sunlight. And then when you go outside you kind of like, "oh the sunlight" kind of makes me feel a little bit happier.

19:34:19 Coach: Vitamin D. It's a thing. Yeah, like I kind of didn't really believe it as much and then now that I'm like "oh I was..." there was really... that was really helpful. Okay, cool. And so I'm hearing a couple ideas and I'm just going to reflect that back to you and you let me know whether you want to create one goal or two goals around the things that you've mentioned. So I've heard that like being physical helps you alleviate some of your stress and some of your anxiety, and then you've faced some challenges before in keeping the routine. But it's still important to you to like, maybe do something around there. And then I'm also hearing that like being outside or going for a walk outside can be something that you need in your life and want to incorporate. Just even a little bit of sun makes you so much happier, like that's powerful stuff. So, and then also earlier you had mentioned around eating more vegetables and, like, I'm hearing a lot about physical activity. So, what do you want to set a goal around, either of those things, any of those things?

19:35:41 Participant: All of those things like I like the idea of both just to like, also help with my eating because like that's also a big part of like, making sure that you feel good when you work out.

19:35:56 Coach: So, let me tell you a little bit about the way that I format the goals, and then you can tell me kind of fill in the blank. So, we use the approach of SMART goals which stands for specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. For this program, we keep the timely part to a week. So "in a week, I will" and then you want to be specific, "go on a 10 minute bike ride for three of the four" or "three of the five days," or "four or five out of the seven days" so that's just one example. And so even if you say like "I'm going to exercise," I'd want us to be more specific, for example, "I'm going to go on a 20 minute run," or "I'm going to lift weights three times, do three reps with 10 pounds" like make it as specific as possible, and then... So, yeah, I'm just gonna... So Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely. Hit me with it, what does that look like for you?

19:37:23 Participant: Specifically I want to be able to go for a two mile run at least three times out of the week.

19:37:48 Coach: And I think you nailed it. So, so far I'm... So, in the next week you will go on a two mile run on three of the seven days. Can we be more specific with times? Like in the evening on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday? Wednesday and Friday? We can be that specific if it's helpful to you. But if you want that flexibility, that's okay.

19:38:36 Participant: I like the flexibility because sometimes like it just changes how I feel that day. Like, if I feel more sluggish, I don't do runs, I'll just kind of like... we have a treadmill so I'll kind of like walk. And then I'll do weights because that's more like stationary.

19:38:58 Coach: So, with this goal though you've made it really specific, and now you're going to go on a two mile run.

19:39:07 Participant: Yeah. So, three days, so I was, yeah. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturday mornings.

19:39:24 Coach: Because Wednesday, Friday I work. So we, like I said, we do try to be specific with the health goals, because then you can also plan. So, block, like if you use Google Calendar or... you mentioned your dad uses reminders. So like you wouldn't want to set those reminders for yourself, either. The time before, are those tools helpful to you?

19:39:44 Participant: Yeah, what I used to do and I still do it actually and I need to buy markers, you just reminded me, but I use dry erase on my mirror in my restroom. So, when I have things to do I write them on my mirror, because you know you go to the restroom constantly looking at yourself. It's always right there because it reminds me. So, okay, I'll start doing that also again, because I had stopped doing that.

19:40:22 Coach: So, I will let you remind yourself to buy those mirrors and write it on your mirror. So, buy the dry erase so that you can write it on your mirror. So, let me think... One way to help make sure that this is a good SMART goal is to look at how confident you are in meeting this goal. So I'm just going to like repeat it back to you so that you can tell me. On a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level, and one is like low confidence and 10 is high confidence. So, in the next week you will go on a two mile run on three of the seven days, specifically, I'll say Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday.

19:41:25 Participant: That is a nine.

19:41:25 Coach: That's really good. Okay, cool. Are there any other like resources or tools that you need to help you meet your goal?

19:41:37 Participant: No, I can't think of any.

19:41:55 Coach: And so just to circle back to why this is important to you so hitting that relevant piece. What is going on a two mile run do for you? Why is it important to you?

19:42:17 Participant: It gets back my endurance, and then also my stamina. Like, it's just also important for me to just get back into the swing of things like that because it's, it's also a really easy way to just like workout, besides like doing weights and other stuff like that.

19:42:49 Coach: And something that you mentioned earlier too right, like it helps alleviate your stress and anxiety, which I think we all can use a little more of. Cool. I think if it's okay with you we can transition to your second goal, which was around healthy eating. So similar to the first kind of format, "in the next week, you will," or "I will." And then how would you like to fill in the blank?

19:43:49 Participant: I think... because like I tend to... because it's easy just to pick up fast food, and I know I shouldn't be. I should be cooking more because like I have everything at home it's just like, I don't want to like do that. I know I have to so if I'm like... I guess in the next coming week only pick up like fast food, once a week. Like my usual which is I typically tend to do it three to four times because I get lazy and I shouldn't do that. Especially because I do have healthier foods at home and that's what also helps me eat more vegetables because they're right there.

19:44:33 Coach: So, you will limit your consumption of fast food to one time?

19:44:39 Participant: Yes.

19:45:01 Coach: I guess one kind of scenario I can imagine is on those long days. I'm like, say you ate fast food on Monday, and here comes Tuesday and you're like, "oh man oh man oh man. I really want to get some fast food." What would you like, what would you like the game plan to be in that situation, like, what can you tell yourself, or maybe like how can you hold yourself accountable in that moment?

19:45:37 Participant: When I was in San Francisco I just had my roommate hold my wallet for me. I had a roommate do that for me once. I was just like "take this and like put it somewhere I won't think about looking for it" and she did just that. The issue being is that I ended up having to buy groceries, and she was at work and I couldn't so that was the end of that plan. But I guess what I could do is just because sometimes at work they also feed us. So honestly and they normally give us like a portion of salad, like, or like they'll also bring fruit and just like snacks for us. So I guess in that situation I'll probably just take whatever's left over of the fruit, and then just like munch on that. Or I should... Yeah. Better yet I'll just make myself healthy snacks and I'll make sure that I keep them with me at work, and that way after work I can just like, munch on that instead of like getting fast food.

19:46:50 Coach: So, kind of, surrounding yourself with healthy snacks. Also, are you a crunch person? So that's also what makes it hard for like certain vegetables because vegetables aren't always crunchy.

19:46:58 Participant: And I don't really like celery either and I know that's like a good crunchy one to have but it's... I don't know I can't get past the taste of it being bitter.

19:47:17 Coach: Yeah, I'm not a big celery fan either but I do like carrots and cucumber. Those are other crunchy options. I'm not sure if there's a Trader Joe's in your area but they have like these, like small Persian cucumbers. They're kind of like the size of a pickle, but they're... yeah like they come in like a big pack. Yeah. So, and the cool thing about these is that the skin isn't bitter. And so you can really just bite, you can actually eat them without peeling them.

19:47:51 Participant: I didn't know that. Yeah. I always think they're bitter so that's why I try to peel them. That's good to know that because I didn't realize I could skip a step.

19:48:08 Coach: One other thing that I'll just throw out there as an option is you can text me and say like "Jasmine, I'm really wanting fast food today," and I'd be like, "no. Can you wait till you get home, or like, Is there a banana available? Is there cucumber available?" so you can always use me as a resource is my point there.

19:48:23 Participant: Because sometimes I tell my other friends but they're also just as tired and craving stuff as I am so when I tell them and like, "Oh, go for it like I'm craving the same thing I'm going to do it too" and I'm like "okay you're right, I'll do it too." That other option that's like, "don't do it" it's like "okay you're right I needed that." It'll help me too.

19:49:00 Coach: So, to hit that like relevant piece. And I know I'm sorry for like the repeated question but like, why is this goal important to you?

19:49:15 Participant: Because I believe that when you eat stuff that's fresher, you tend to feel better. There was like a week, I think my sophomore year I ate nothing but like fast food, and then I got tired of fast food. I never craved such freshness and then after I did I felt amazing. And I'm like, "oh," and I was like I'm starting to see why I need to start adding in more fresh either vegetables, fruits or just even like fresh anything. It tasted, I don't know, better and it made me feel more energized. So I know that. I know that's why I need to do it and it's always good to remind yourself like "no it does make you feel better. It does."

19:50:06 Coach: Yeah, totally. So like, and this is where you want like to live your life, you want to live your life, feeling good and feeling energized. And I don't know the exact details but you're taking neurobiology, and I'm sure there's loads of science, like vitamins and minerals and like all those nutrients are important to you and how they relate to your mental health so like I wonder if like grounding yourself in those beliefs as well can help. Okay. Cool. All right. Sorry, another repeated question. On the scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

19:50:52 Participant: This is more like a, like an 8.

19:50:58 Coach: Like slowly, but I know like it's going to get a little bit challenging when like that scenario I brought up because I know that happens to me.

19:51:05 Participant: That's a very real thing like thank you for bringing that up because I'm like that's a really good point you make, I forget about those little moments.

19:51:18 Coach: No, totally. I hear you. And we can support each other and you can reach out for support as well. Okay, cool. So I'm going to just repeat this goal back to you and make sure that it is in line with what you're hoping for this week. So in the next week you will limit your consumption of fast food to one time.

19:51:41 Participant: Yes.

19:51:49 Coach: And then your first goal is in the next week, you'll go on a two mile run on three of the seven days specifically Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday. So I think these are really good health goals for you this week. And I'll check in with you through text message. The other thing I forgot to say is, if you want to respond to any of like the automatic messages, it'll come to me. I have one person who's like, messaging me back random emojis which is hilarious. No pressure. I was just giving an example. And also if you need to chat with me at any time, you can reach me through there. Let me think what else. Our next health coaching session. Can we transition to scheduling that? So let me look at next week. Next week, I have 5:15 available on Thursday if this is a good day for you, Pacific Standard Time when we specify Pacific Standard Time. And, as well as the 7:15 which is the time that we met today.

19:53:15 Participant: What was the first time you gave before the Thursday?

19:53:19 Coach: 5:15.

19:53:22 Participant: So, yeah, that should be good. Okay, the 16th I go to Houston, especially we know I have to be at Houston at six. Is it okay if we have it like sometime like Monday or Tuesday? Because I'm leaving to Houston and I'm going to be there, like the for that Friday because I'm shadowing a pediatrician. And then the 17th, 18th my family's there, we're going to be with family. I can also do like Wednesday.

19:54:08 Coach: I'm so sorry it says my internet is unstable, by the way, I'm okay but if we... I also have availability on Wednesday at 6:15. So we can transition there. But if you want the Monday time, I have 6:15 and 7:15.

19:54:29 Participant: Wednesday at 6:15 Pacific time right?

19:54:36 Coach: Yeah. And then do we do all of our sessions to be on Wednesday at 6:15, or just the next one?

19:54:46 Participant: Just the next one.

19:54:49 Coach: Do you want to schedule the other... the other two can be on the Thursdays at 6:15?

19:54:54 Participant: Awesome.

19:54:59 Coach: So I don't have 6:15 on Thursday, but I have 5:15 or 7:15.

19:55:06 Participant: Okay, I'm gonna write this down and then I'll send you calendar invites in a little bit. So, April 14th at 6:15 and then April 22nd at 5:15. And then, the 29th at 5:15.

19:55:27 Coach: Okay. I'll also send you a follow up email with the health goals that you've set for yourself. And then, oh, sorry I feel a little scatterbrained. But, so you'll have to run three times by next Wednesday. So you're gonna have to like bump the Thursday one to a different day. So just a heads up.

19:55:55 Participant: That's okay I already did that. It was a 30 minute run today actually. I woke up, I decided to do that. It was also sunny, really sunny today and the rest of the day was going to be in the 90s and I'm not going to run in 90 degree heat.

19:56:09 Coach: Yeah, good point. So, let me know too if you want to send me photos, like, I know we don't have like a specific food related one but people have been sending goals around the healthy eating and they'll send me pictures of the foods. So if you want to send me photos of like the sunrise or like any nice scenery while you're out on your run, feel free to do something like that. Any questions before we sign off?

19:56:44 Participant: Everything was kind of straightforward.
