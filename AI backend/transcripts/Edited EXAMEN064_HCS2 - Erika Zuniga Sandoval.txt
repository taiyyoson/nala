12:02:30 Coach: Hi. Hi. How's it going?

12:02:32 Participant: Going good, thank you.

12:02:35 Coach: How are you?

12:02:36 Participant: Good. I just can't believe that it's already one thing. I feel like I talked to you like yesterday.

12:02:48 Coach: I know, time is just going by really quick. I think that's all it is. Yeah, but I'm glad that we're able to make it today.

12:03:00 Participant: Trying to, okay, with everything that I need on my screen.

12:03:07 Coach: So how are you? How are you doing today?

12:03:08 Participant: I'm good. I feel like this whole week and the following weeks are going to be so busy because I'm kind of in the finals time in my program, so there's just a lot of papers and stuff, and then work.

12:03:27 Coach: So, yeah, there's a lot of things that are coming up for you at this time. And how was your action plan for your goal last week? How did it go?

12:03:42 Participant: I think it went really well. On Sunday, I had a lot of homework. One of my friends—she's also a student—she's going to law school. And so, I live in Outer Sunset. There's this cafe called Java Beach, and she asked if I wanted to go super early in the morning and just do homework together. I had to think about whether that would be considered a social activity for myself or a productive day. I decided it was productive since it was just us, and we were there from 10am to 4pm. I got a lot of work done, so I felt like I planned a social part of my life but also got work done.

12:05:06 Coach: Yeah, I think that's a great modification for what you wanted, which was to focus on school, but also find time for yourself doing productive activity. That's very good.
 You also wanted to start some strength training. How did that go?

12:05:29 Participant: It went really well. I had a consultation with a personal trainer, and he was very convincing. I ended up signing up for a few sessions with him. My first real session was last Friday, and then my first one-on-one session started Monday. It was a confidence booster—I realized I’m stronger than I thought. He increased the weight gradually, and it really boosted my confidence. I’m excited because I want to get stronger and be confident with weights. I have another session today.

12:07:01 Coach: That's great. How many sessions a week are you doing with him?

12:06:53 Participant: For the first three weeks, two times a week, then once a week after that. He wants me to commit to four or five times a week overall. He also gave me a book to track progress. I never thought I’d do it, but I am. It's weird because I work out in front of people, my biggest fear, but I feel better because he's there.

12:08:02 Coach: You've taken great steps. Having support is very helpful, and it builds self-confidence. If you could rate yourself on a scale of 1–10 for meeting your goals, what would it be?

12:08:40 Participant: Solid nine.

12:08:45 Coach: Very good. Earlier, you mentioned a lot of things coming up. For this week, what’s your stress level on a scale of 1–10?

12:09:10 Participant: Probably an eight. All my deadlines are coming up in two weeks. It's a lot, but manageable.

12:09:26 Coach: A lot has happened since we met. You had your training session, started strength training, and set aside time for yourself. What are you hoping to check in about today?

12:09:42 Participant: In general, my health. I’m going home this weekend to visit my family. I got a new job in February. Before that, I was working every day, six to seven days a week, balancing school and work. In January, I had a meltdown—I hated my previous job, even though the pay was good. I realized I wasn’t happy. A friend introduced me to a new opportunity. I applied and got it, with the same pay but more flexibility, working from home and weekends off. I promised myself I’d visit family more often. I want to carve out time for homework but also spend time with my family.

12:14:03 Coach: Thinking about your progress this week, with strength training and carving out time for yourself, what would be a good goal for the upcoming week?

12:14:18 Participant: Even though I’m going home, I want to make time for something active with my family—like walking our dog or doing yoga with my little sister.

12:15:25 Coach: How many minutes would be feasible?

12:15:38 Participant: About 30 minutes. One day during Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

12:16:16 Coach: How will we measure progress?

12:16:28 Participant: Using my Apple Watch to track activity that day.

12:16:42 Coach: Why is this important?

12:17:30 Participant: Being active helps manage my anxiety. I started therapy because, during COVID, my anxiety was really bad. Being active tires me out and helps me sleep. Without activity, my anxiety spikes.

12:19:33 Coach: So the plan is to be active with your family for 30 minutes one day during the weekend, tracked with your Apple Watch. How confident are you about achieving this?

12:19:56 Participant: Pretty confident, around nine.

12:20:02 Coach: Do you want to work on anything else this week?

12:20:10 Participant: I want to focus on this goal because I already have strength training with my trainer as an ongoing goal.

12:20:43 Coach: How many days this week will you do strength training?

12:21:02 Participant: Monday and today, for 30 minutes each. I track it with my Apple Watch.

12:22:01 Coach: How confident are you about making it twice a week?

12:22:06 Participant: Solid 10—I’m paying for it, so I have to show up.

12:23:35 Coach: What were some successes this week?

12:23:49 Participant: Realizing I could lift more weight than I thought and being productive with my friend. I stayed consistent, balanced social and work, and felt good about managing it all.

12:25:02 Coach: What challenges are you still facing?

12:25:15 Participant: My self-esteem. I still compare myself to other women at the gym, which can be discouraging. I’m working on being happy where I am and stopping comparisons.

12:26:44 Coach: Have you considered using positive affirmations?

12:27:13 Participant: Yes, I’ve heard about them. I like morning messages because they remind me I’m on my own journey. I focus on feeling stronger rather than looking a certain way. Social media can be toxic with “summer body” messaging, but I remind myself of my goals.

12:28:58 Coach: Images and media create ideas that affect self-esteem. Talking with someone in therapy helps process those messages. Any specific messages from the week that stood out?

12:31:06 Participant: One about spiritual growth and identity. Another about health goals. I grew up Catholic but am more cultural than practicing. I like connecting spiritually while setting boundaries.

12:33:22 Coach: That’s a beautiful reflection. Every person has a process. Take the good things, let go of the rest, and pass on the lessons to future generations. Any other questions?

12:35:38 Participant: No, this was a really good check-in.

12:35:44 Coach: I’ll send a summary before the end of the day. Have a great weekend with your family.
