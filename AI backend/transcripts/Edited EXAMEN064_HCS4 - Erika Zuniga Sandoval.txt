12:03:45 Coach: How are you today?

12:03:50 Participant: I'm good. I'm at work, so today I was supposed to, usually I'm working from home but they decided to schedule me for a vaccination site so I'm here. It's really slow and I'm on my break so it's okay.

12:04:02 Coach: Okay, okay. Well today is our last coaching session sadly, so towards the end of today I'll tell you a little bit more about next steps. But before that, of course I want to hear how your goals went for the week. How did you do?

12:04:25 Participant: I did really good. I was able to like work out and really stay focused like on my health goals. And I think that was my main one right, like doing, keeping track of that.

12:04:40 Coach: Yeah, yeah, being able to exercise because you knew that your work schedule was going to be changing and you also have that additional job that you were going to be doing. So you wanted to make sure you still have time to exercise. Yeah.

12:04:56 Participant: Yeah, so I did. I'm really excited. So I was able to do that. And today is the only day that I am not going to go to the gym. But it's because finals are starting to creep up so I decided that, when like today will be my study day. It's a nice day outside, I don't know in your area but it's actually pretty in San Francisco right now, so I'm thinking yeah, so I'm thinking of just like looking at my assignments and what to do and like really focusing on that.

12:05:31 Coach: No, that's good, that's good. And in thinking of the things that are coming up, how is your stress this last week on a scale of one to 10, one being not stressed and 10 very stressed?

12:05:44 Participant: I would say it wasn't as bad. It wasn't bad, much better, much better.

12:05:56 Coach: And were there any messages that stood out to you this week?

12:06:01 Participant: Yes, just give me, I know I looked at it so it was. I like that, I know I didn't respond exactly to it but actually like the self care bingo. I thought that was really cute.

12:06:22 Coach: Yeah, that was a fun one to make. Like the graphic itself, I was like wow, like it's really, it's different. It's not just the text with things. Any others? 

12:06:43 Participant: That was the main one. It was mostly the main one that I that stood out to me. I also, I think it's more because of like I'm a visual person. So I actually really liked the one with the avocado bowl. I'm like it puts an image in your head of like oh maybe I should try like recreating that or like that looks good but then they'll have, you know like okay avocado looks good. Like I went in the fridge so let me add it to my like lentil rice and stuff.

12:07:21 Coach: Okay, awesome. So being that today is our last session, what are you hoping to check in about today? And how can we continue to keep you on this path to stay on track of your goals? What are you thinking?

12:07:39 Participant: Um, I've been, I've been liking like the consistency that I feel I've been able to build. I'm using things like writing down my intentions for the week or like my goals, but also I think my Apple Watch, using it more strategically would be the word because before like I used to use the Apple Watch more for like aesthetic purposes like oh yeah it's my watch and it's there. But now it's more like I actually use the features that it offers. You know I use the rings and I use the Apple settings and I take advantage of like the free Apple fitness plus that allowed me to try virtual yoga and like all these cool things that I wanted to always try but it allowed me to kind of just like dip my toe in like okay maybe I could do you know yoga in person or something like that.

12:08:36 Coach: Well, that's awesome. And I think sometimes we forget all the things that it could come with right or the access. Yeah, that's good. So you mentioned you were able to try the virtual yoga. What did you think of it?

12:08:53 Participant: Um, I really liked it. The one I did was only 10 minutes which I think was perfect because it was a beginners yoga class and the way Apple sets it up is like you don't need any equipment, just you don't even need a mat if you don't have one so that's really cool. It's very like in my point of view it's inclusive, but I luckily had a mat already so I went to use that. And a lot of it was more like being present so it was like a lot of breath work first, and then slowly transitioning into like stretches and then doing like basic poses. And so it made me ease into it a little bit more.

12:09:34 Coach: Yeah, I think that's a very good start and oftentimes we think of yoga as like automatically jumping into all these like stretches and like downward dogs right. Yeah, there's a lot of work behind it in terms of like the breathing aspect of it. So I think that's a very good first introduction to get to.

12:10:00 Coach: So for this upcoming week, what is something that you want to, or what is the goal that you want to set for yourself? What are you thinking?

12:10:15 Participant: Um, for this upcoming week, I think it's going to be I want to stay in the same theme, you know that I've been in the past because I know once I start doing something consistently and no longer has to be something that I have to purposely do but it just becomes like oh it's part of my like schedule. So I want to be able to work some time in for my sweaty pursuit. I call it like sweaty pursuit because it's not, it doesn't necessarily have to be at the gym you know it can be at home, or like I live right next to Ocean Beach so it's like even a walk there and back is like something that I can do.

12:11:10 Coach: So I think I want to stick with that in that schedule and keep the momentum of what I've been doing the past weeks. Like you know, keep the momentum of that physical activity going, and it can be in different ways like you said it could be through going to the gym or it could be through going for a walk. So having a variety of activities that you could do. And how many days during the week do you plan to continue to practice like some type of physical activity?

12:11:39 Participant: My goal is minimum five days a week. Because I do want to block myself two days of like, also 100% focus those two days on finals that are coming up. So even though like I can do both right like schedule a time where I can pursue like a workout or you know active. Like when I, I know that as a student like my studying habits, it's like if I start studying I just keep going all day and like that's how I get things done versus like carving out two hours. It basically takes like two hours to like get in the mood to study so it's like I can't do that like I need a whole day to like get it going. Yeah.

12:12:26 Coach: And when you're thinking of doing this for five days a week, how much time do you want to allot to it? Like how much activity time do you want to set aside for it?

12:12:42 Participant: I think an hour is pretty like a good time. Like one hour.

12:12:48 Coach: One hour five days of the week. And do you, what time of the day works better for you or have you found that works better if you do something morning, in the afternoon and the evening? What has worked the best for you so far?

12:13:01 Participant: So far I've done like a mix to be honest. I've done, depending on my work schedule sometimes it's like I will get up in the mornings to just kind of knock out that workout and then go to work right after. But then on days that I can work from home, I'm a little bit more flexible so I wake up and I'll do work, but then in the evening in order to like kind of get off the house and get air out of working, I'll go in the evening. And yeah, so but definitely like morning and evening are going to are my go-tos.

12:13:43 Coach: Any other goal that you want to set for yourself, or do you think this one is a good one to keep going for now?

12:13:53 Participant: Yeah, I really liked this one.

12:13:57 Coach: How confident do you feel about being able to achieve it? On a scale of one, not so confident and 10 very confident.

12:14:06 Participant: I think like an 8.5.

12:14:13 Coach: Yeah. I always say anything seven or above tells us that yes, you've thought about it and this is something that you want to keep going. Yeah. And you've been working towards this throughout the last few weeks very consistently. And that's you mentioned, it sort of opened your mind to exploring other ideas of other physical activity that you could do. So I think it's a very good thing to keep going. And you also have talked about ways to keep yourself motivated so using like for example your watch because it gives you like real life updates of how you're doing with your physical activity. I think those are all good ways to also remember and to stay on track. Any other successes that you had that you want to share, or any challenges that you're facing that you want to maybe problem solve around?

12:15:17 Participant: No, honestly like I think, I think what's really helped me is like intentionally setting my goals beforehand, and not just being like oh I'll get to it when I get to it or like I'll figure it out in a little bit. Like talking about it early on kind of plants the seed in my in my head, and then subconsciously I'm planning and like do this and do that and so once I think about it early on, it allows me to like my personality I think also helps achieving my goals because it's like once something's already like once I say I'm going to do something, I have to do it because it's like if I don't then I just feel like crappy at the end like oh I didn't do that or like I didn't get to that and I messed up and, you know, especially if it's something that benefits me in the long run like my workouts and stuff like that. And um, I don't know it's it's been really helpful and I think also like my personal trainer's been super helpful just because that's given me confidence to like feel stronger and I just do a new workout that I would never do on my own, but like now I am and yeah, that's also another thing that's very good.

12:16:33 Coach: The other thing I would say is I mean this is only four weeks that we have with each other. And the goal of course is for you to gain sort of skills that can help you long term, right. So I think you bring up a really good point about how important it is to intentionally set goals. So in thinking about, you know, future goals that you set for yourself, or even just thinking about improving your health overall. Whenever you find yourself in that situation or kind of wanting to refresh things up. Use this again, the idea of goal setting is really helpful. And it's, it's also the reason why we focus so much on it every week because if we just break things down into smaller, more doable steps and tasks, it can really help us to reach like bigger goals that we have in mind. It makes them more attainable, in a way. Yeah, so as you continue to grow in your health journey or your wellness, just think of everything as how can I set a goal around this that can help me achieve like what I want at the end, which I know for you you had really wanted to work on strengthening and being able to be stronger and lift. I remember you mentioned that you are trying to lift a box and it was like 25 pounds and it was difficult. So just being able to figure out, well what are the steps I need to take before I can actually do that? It's important.

12:18:13 Participant: Yes. Yeah, I agree, I agree and I think yeah I think for me I was always into like long term goals you know and I think that works for me but I've also now have been able to practice short term goals which are so much, or feel so much more rewarding. Like I think long term goals can be overwhelming but like short term goals kind of like bring that instant gratification, which is something I always want and so it's just nice to like learn something new about myself like okay yeah like you can also do short term goals.

12:18:46 Coach: Yeah, I know a lot of us just as human beings we want that instant gratification. Yeah, yeah, definitely short term goals are the way to go for that. But knowing that those short term goals can add up to something bigger. And I think that's very good to think. So you've done very well.

12:19:12 Participant: Thank you. This has been a great time like talking to you. It's so easy and comfortable. I really am so happy I decided to join this project.

12:19:25 Coach: It's been, it's been really exciting for us I guess as students as well, to see something that we develop coming to real life. And see how it can impact like individuals, other individual students I think that's been very rewarding for us. And of course we cannot have this without you. Otherwise, well I think that you set a great goal for yourself to continue to work with. As with other weeks I'll send you a summary of the goal, just so that you have that and as a reminder. So in regards to next steps, you will be receiving a few more texts, I believe. I don't think you've received all of them yet. But it should be ending probably around the end of this week. So there's a few more. And please feel free to continue responding with your thoughts about them. It really helps us to figure out what messages we want to keep or how can we improve the messages. For example you mentioned maybe more graphics, more photos would actually be more helpful and that helps us. And you're also going to receive a link for a follow up survey. And you should get that before the end of today. So the survey you'll notice is very similar to the one you took at the very beginning. However, it's not as long. It probably should only take you maybe 15 minutes or less. And then after you complete that survey, it is important that you do it right away, because then we can schedule sort of like a little feedback interview. Okay. And that will be done by another colleague of mine, because I am your health coach I cannot do the feedback because they want an unbiased opinion. They'll ask you a few questions about your experience, once again, they'll ask you about your feedback on how we can improve the program. This meeting typically is a little bit longer, maybe 40 minutes to an hour. And we have been trying to schedule it around the same time where the health coaches have met with the participants. So for example with you, we've been meeting on Wednesdays at noon. Do you think that will be a good time for to set up that feedback interview?

12:22:04 Participant: Yeah, I think it still will be a good time. As long as like it's scheduled you know and I know ahead of time, that way I'm in a better space and and like more flexible and stuff like that but yeah it should still be a good time.

12:22:18 Coach: I mean so right now as it stands we're thinking next Wednesday, which is, which I believe is May 5th.

12:22:30 Participant: Yeah, it looks like I could do that at 12pm.

12:22:30 Coach: Okay, yeah. So let me just double check that someone is available to do the interview with you. And then as soon as you complete the survey, the follow up survey will confirm the date and send you the link for that.

12:22:52 Participant: Okay yeah that sounds good because I want to stay consistent with like my schedule. I don't want to miss it. So yeah.

12:22:59 Coach: Yeah. So just know that it might be a different zoom link because I'm not going to be the person running the meeting. Just FYI, but the invite will still come from the same Gmail. So you should still be able to get it.

12:23:16 Participant: Okay. Yeah, that sounds good.

12:23:19 Coach: And if you have any questions in the meantime, just let me know. And I still get your responses to text messages, and I still have access to the email where we have been corresponding so if anything comes up along the way, just feel free to reach out.

12:23:36 Participant: Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Pleasure to meet you and I really. Likewise, I'm well sad but it's okay. Well I feel like we'll reconnect or cross paths somehow, some way.

12:23:50 Coach: I mean, I think Alumni Association, or it gets large too.

12:23:55 Participant: Yeah, I was telling some of the students so I have your email, if I ever want to stop by.

12:24:02 Coach: Good. I think for the purpose of the study and until like at least the feedback interview is complete, we're doing our best to keep the personal separate from the business. Yeah I totally understand it's part of your research and your program so yeah definitely you'll have our contact info so whenever you want to reach out, I'm here.

12:24:28 Participant: I mean, networking like that works for like job opportunities and stuff like that too so we'll chat, we'll chat. Thank you. Thank you so much. And thank you for all the great pointers for the applications. I remember we talked at some point about job searching and applying to different positions.

12:24:47 Coach: And then, yeah. I will always keep an eye out here, you know. So where are you today physically located?

12:24:49 Participant: So I am in the Mission District at the vaccination site right now. Yes, and I've never I'm not usually placed in like vaccine sites but the person that usually is in my spot isn't here today so they were like can you please come in because they do need like a lot of folks who speak Spanish in this district so of course, you know. Yeah, we have to support. We are the translators, interpreters and everything. Yes, so I've just been here and then kind of like my personality, like I always kind of chat with everyone like. Have you seen a therapist? No I'm not following that but like I'm just like how's your house, like almost like that, like all these things and it's nice to communicate because some people talking to a stranger they can actually really vent like how they actually feel versus talking to a family member who they kind of just want to look like they're okay to, you know, so it's nice.

12:25:55 Coach: And that goes well with your psych school background with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but it gives you a feel of them being different.

12:26:04 Participant: Yes. But yeah, it was nice. I'm like all of the goal setting and everything. Thank you so much I appreciate it and like I said, I can reach out sometime.

12:26:18 Coach: Have a good rest of your day. Bye. Bye.
