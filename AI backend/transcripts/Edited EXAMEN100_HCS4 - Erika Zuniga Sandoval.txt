12:23:02 Coach: Hi.

12:23:02 Participant: Hi. I don't know what happened.

12:23:07 Coach: Yeah, I was wondering if it was me and I was like oh no, no I don't think it was you, I think it was me. It completely closed down.

12:23:17 Participant: And so I've tried to connect to a different Wi-Fi that I have for emergencies, just in case. And they kept saying reconnecting but it wasn't connecting. It's so strange.

12:23:30 Coach: Huh. Oh yeah, yeah okay, it's okay. We're back.

12:23:41 Participant: Okay, so you are on the messages, on what stood out to you. And you were talking about how you had food that they brought for you guys and you ate all your vegetables.

12:23:56 Coach: Right. And that's sort of where you left off.

12:24:03 Participant: And that's around the time that you had sent it yesterday like around lunchtime. And then I don't know if that was strategic or not, but and then I was starting the message you and like elected on draft and yeah and then that kind of happened but that one was the main one that stood out for me.

12:24:23 Coach: Okay. Awesome. Well I'm glad that it helped you to try something new and to eat all your vegetables before everything else.

12:24:43 Participant: I think we got everything else we have three very good goals. We talked about this, anything you want to bring up? You know, I actually, this morning I emailed my ob-gyn lady. And because I don't know if I have mentioned to you about like kind of being fearful of getting all the like full tests or like fertility, fertility testing, things like that. And so you know I kind of have been thinking a lot about it too, and especially right now that I'm going to have more time I think that I felt that it was important to do that. And so I reached out - she's on vacation until next week, so I'm just waiting to hear back from her to see if there is like something that I can do or if like I don't know, even just she could like maybe say hey it's okay, like some people take, you know, take a longer time to get pregnant or things like that. I don't know, just because I know that's something that's like just in the back of my mind, it's been there.

12:25:53 Coach: And let me ask you, if you don't mind me asking, are you trying to have a baby right now?

12:26:13 Participant: I'm not currently, and I did put that in the email. I told her you know I'm not currently but I have had, you know like, partners where we don't protect ourselves. I mean, you know, some are longer term, so it's kind of like well you know if it happens it happens or things like that. But it's for me it just felt like, you know, I don't know, like three years of that and still nothing, and it's something that has come up for me and I know it's in my family too so it's kind of like that concern. And you know, just I have very irregular period flows and things like that, so I don't know, just maybe I'm paranoid but it really, there's concerns on my end.

12:26:53 Coach: I think that if it's something that worries you and something that is constantly on your mind, having that awareness and just reaching out to your physician and addressing it now, it's really the best way to go because in a way it's going to help you ease some of those concerns that you're having, or at least give you information that can help you process that, if that makes any sense.

12:27:20 Participant: Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry, I'm like being all nosy. Oh no, no, because you know it's I know it's part of like my overall health and my checkups and especially in that department. Like I just, like I've mentioned, like it's just not - I've always had like a really bad relationship with like, you know that, like more like hormones or, I don't know, just, I don't know.

12:27:45 Coach: I mean, our hormones affect our health, right? And our wellbeing, so if you know it's something that you want to be good to have under control to help your overall health. Of course, you need to talk to your ob-gyn.

12:28:00 Participant: Yeah. Okay. That's very practical. Very well done.

12:28:07 Coach: So as I had mentioned at the very beginning, today is our last session. We have quite a bit of an interruption there. Do you have other questions before I tell you more about next steps?

12:28:23 Participant: No, no, not really. I mean I kind of have like nosy questions, but it's okay we can answer them but more like, you know, is this something that like you and your team are developing? Like is it something that's going to continue like? Is there something like resources? What I mean I guess it kind of goes with the next steps maybe, like what happens next?

12:28:54 Coach: Right. Well, this is a pilot project. So we're working on gathering all the data from students that have participated. So we can report back to the Jesuit Foundation because they actually gave us the original grant to work on this. And also to present our results to other potential funders. So our goal is to be able to get funding so we can continue to provide this program, or to expand this program, and we are thinking of potentially reaching back to you, our participants, a few months down the line. Once we have all our data gathered, because we do want you to know what happened with all the information that was gathered and this is all going to be like aggregate data and just findings, like general findings that we have. So just keep an eye out on your email a few months from now, you'll most likely hear from us again. Because we do want to know also like how are you doing with your goals, is it something that you were able to keep up after our intervention with us? So definitely keep it up because my goal is to check back in and see how are you doing. Okay. But before all of that, we do need to wrap up this project. And part of that of course includes like evaluations and surveys and a lot of other things.\Right now, the next steps are really to - you're going to be getting a few more text messages. I believe your text messages end on Sunday or so. So please continue to respond to them, any thoughts that you have. And you are going to receive a link for a follow up survey through email by the end of today. This survey similar to the previous one that you did before enrolling into the program, but it should be a little quicker, should only take maybe about 15 minutes. After you complete the survey, you will be invited to meet with a fellow colleague to do like a feedback meeting where they're going to ask you about your experience, your feedback on how to improve the program. And this meeting typically will take anywhere from 40 to 60 minutes. So right now we want to schedule them around the same time that we've been meeting. So I know originally we were meeting Wednesday night, but would you want to set up that feedback interview for a Thursday at noon, maybe next week or did you want to do a Wednesday evening, where were you thinking?

12:31:41 Participant: Well we'll work with whatever I'm - I'm honestly free next week I think we're on spring break, or we're on break or at least I am. So I'm free like whenever.

12:31:54 Coach: Okay, so whatever works best if you have a preference or anyone else has a preference.

12:31:58 Participant: All right, I just found a little - the strangest thing. I'm so sorry, little stink bugs.

12:32:20 Coach: Those little stink bugs. Oh, here's one like walking around all over my laptop when I do get down to try to like catch it, it goes back up on my because I have a little top to stand my laptop on. And then it hides. So funny. They've been following me around. I'll tell you story after we're done with everything. Okay.

12:32:43 Participant: So you're thinking - so you said you're available Wednesday night, Thursday.

12:32:51 Coach: Yeah, either one whatever works best.

12:32:55 Participant: I'm thinking maybe Thursday at noon, because I know someone that's available to do it during that time. Okay, maybe make sure it happens like sooner rather than later. So next Thursday would be the 13th.

12:33:15 Coach: I don't know. Yes, 13th. Hey like that looking at a calendar and I don't have to work a little checkout lately.

12:33:24 Participant: You know, you need that. You're going for three days just to reset.

12:33:29 Coach: Yeah. So, I will put it tentatively for May 13 at 12pm. It is important that you complete the survey before, or as soon as possible. That way I can send you the calendar invite for that, but we'll hold that calendar at our end. Okay. And once you complete the survey, we'll add it to that.

12:33:51 Participant: Okay.

12:33:53 Coach: Any questions about that?

12:33:55 Participant: No, no question.

12:33:56 Coach: Well, I do want to thank you so much for participating in our program. It's been a pleasure to work with you these last four weeks, and you work really hard to make positive changes in your life so we hope that you keep it going. And remember that you are in control of your life and your connections to health and wellness. So hopefully what the skills that we work on like goal setting can help you to continue formulating those goals for the future. To help you achieve the things that you want to do. Yeah. And take good care of yourself. Remember when we take care of ourselves we're more, or better, or we're more able to take care of others as well.

12:34:44 Participant: Yeah, I agree. Thank you honestly this, this program is amazing. I don't know how much time we have. I just wanted to say that I think it's a very much needed program. I'm very interested. I hope this really goes like somewhere. I want, I would want something like this.

12:35:06 Coach: I would tell you that when you meet with - because I'm hoping that your feedback interview is with my professor. Okay, at noon, let her know all those things. Let her know how it helps you. Let her know that this is something that we need more, because those are the types of things that we need to be able to get back to anyone that we ask for funding to say hey why is this a need? And oftentimes there's a lot of programming out there for different populations, but I feel that young women are often forgotten. So we need to make sure that we remind everyone out there that we are an asset, we need resources, and this would be a great resource to continue to have.

12:35:54 Participant: Right. Yes it is. So, thank you for being a part of this too and like we're the time you know the last four weeks. It's been really great and accountability is - I mean, like I said, I really love this program. It was pilot program.

12:36:12 Coach: Yeah, I wish that it was longer at times but it is a pilot. And we need more data to be able to make it more sustainable. So thank you, thank you so much.

12:36:24 Participant: Thank you so much for your time.

12:36:27 Coach: Yeah, thank you. Take care.
