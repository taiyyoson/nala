17:14:42 Participant: Hey, how are you?

17:14:44 Coach: Good, how are you?

17:14:47 Participant: Good. Relaxing now, after work.

17:14:50 Coach: Yeah. Did you go into the office?

17:14:52 Participant: No I was at my house today.

17:14:58 Coach: Okay, cool. How did your last week go?

17:15:06 Participant: Where did I, what?

17:15:08 Coach: How did your last week go?

17:15:10 Participant: I wasn't as successful as I wish I was because like I said I was on site most of the time. So, at work I work with youth, so like if I want to drink water or want to eat something like I have to walk away from them. And I'm like, "yeah, I'm not doing that." When did we meet on Monday?

17:15:37 Coach: Last Monday yeah so... I guess like I was unprepared to make the change. Today I had... I thought the only way I feel like I have to start early in the morning like I had to start on Monday early in the morning, because then I felt like I was off track, if that makes sense.

17:16:00 Participant: So today I'm on my fourth bottle of water, and I had two tortillas, and I had rice, broccoli, cucumber, and shrimp.

17:16:16 Coach: So you had three goals last week. The first goal was around finding five recipes that you can use for basically kind of like, as a preparatory thing. Were you able to find five recipes?

17:16:33 Participant: Yes, I have five.

17:16:37 Coach: Okay, so you've met your goal there.

17:16:39 Participant: Yeah, I did it right after we went over it.

17:16:44 Coach: Oh, so that was done pretty early on. Okay, but hey, that's pretty good. Getting it done is part of, or is all you have to do. And then your second goal was around drinking water. It was, if I remember correctly, it was five bottles of water for four days. And so, how many days were you able to drink five bottles of water?

17:17:32 Participant: Let me check. Tuesday I only had two, Wednesday I only had one, Thursday I had three. And then I guess I didn't track the rest and then Friday to today, so I haven't... I'm on my... I haven't logged the other one, three I'm seeing me. So I haven't had five since the last night.

17:18:04 Coach: So, zero out of four days?

17:18:06 Participant: Yes.

17:18:07 Coach: Okay. That's okay. You know, I think, going back to, was it realistic, or was it relevant? Maybe we need to like hit that point a little more because you did talk about the challenges you're going to face and so, yeah. Something to be more mindful of moving forward. And then for the third goal, it was going to be one tortilla a day for seven days, but then today you ended up having two tortillas.

17:18:52 Participant: Yes.

17:18:54 Coach: Okay, so then six out of seven. Sounds like... I don't know percentage wise, but let's name it as like 85% or 90%. So you've completed, I'll say like most of your goals except for the water one. So, from your perspective on a scale of one to ten, how did you do in meeting your goals?

17:19:19 Participant: I would say like six or seven.

17:19:26 Coach: So you know you're capable, you're capable of doing it, it's just maybe not making it so challenging, in the sense of like, you can't drink water at work... So one question that's kind of related is like the stress question. Over the last week, how was your level of stress on a scale of one to ten?

17:20:05 Participant: Last week, I would say like an eight.

17:20:14 Coach: That's a pretty high stress level. Do you think that also impacted you in being successful with some of your health goals?

17:20:24 Participant: Yes, my partner that I work with, she found a new job so her last day was Friday. I started a new class and I'm very shy. And I do talk in class but it's like mandatory and I hate it, and that's stressing me out. And I had to decide which internship I was going to take, and then sending that email of like "I'm no longer interested," it was like "oh my god I couldn't even sleep."

17:21:00 Coach: Wow, so a lot of things happened like a lot of big things happened all in one week.

17:21:07 Participant: But I went to... I think you saw, I think it was you who saw the picture, I went hiking yesterday. And then I sent that email to the internship yesterday last night, so I was like "I just need to clear my mind and when I come back home I'll still be thinking of what the internship should be."

17:21:25 Coach: So you used hiking as almost an activity to help distract you. Also, you know, just to offer some validation like you can't do everything in one week. That's normal. That's okay. And they're going to be understanding of that like, yeah, you have to say no. So, I hope that alleviates some of your stress. I'm also... I noticed that you have been really responsive to the text messages like with the emojis here and there. I have been getting them and I got your photo too so thank you for sending them over. And so you've gotten like new messages all week since we met last Monday, have any of them stood out to you? Like what are you liking, maybe not liking?

17:22:26 Participant: And I do like the messages, it's just like a reminder of like, just to slow down. Have you ever been to Hawaii? You know how time in Hawaii, it just goes so slow and here is like we're always in a rush. I don't know it's just like a reminder of... I think that you sent one about, I don't remember what the text was about. I mentioned something like relaxing and then that's when I sent you the picture.

17:23:07 Coach: So the messages were created with hopes of one, letting you know that we have to slow down, and then also just like some educational facts regarding like health and wellness.
 Well, how was your hike?

17:23:23 Participant: It's pretty good, it was our first time there. But I forgot like that it was near Monterey, so my nephews were wearing shorts, and I was like, "oh my god." We've been to Monterey a few times and it's always super cool like it's not sunny out there. So we ended up being a little chilly out there. And it was kind of foggy, but it was really good. It kind of looks like Hawaii. So the area that we went to.

17:24:06 Coach: Yeah, Monterey is really nice. I actually, I'm not sure if I mentioned this before but I live in Santa Cruz. So, Monterey is like the neighbor.

17:24:20 Participant: I only went to Santa Cruz once. Oh, I like it.

17:24:25 Coach: It gets really touristy during the summer months because of the boardwalk.

17:24:30 Participant: I want to go to another area.

17:24:39 Coach: Definitely, yeah, not the main beach. There's so many like little beaches besides the main one. And then there's also a lot of hiking areas too. I can send you information if you want.

17:24:53 Participant: Yeah, my boyfriend loves hiking and he wanted to go to Lake Tahoe, but he loves to hike... like if he could hike every day he would go hiking, and it's like 16 miles and I said, "there's no way I'm doing 16 miles, I was like, no." He wakes up late, so for me I don't hike past 10am like you have to be there. You have to be up at five in the morning ready to hike, be done by 10. But yeah so our next hike is Yosemite. I've never been there. So, next month.

17:25:27 Coach: Yeah, I actually just went there last month. It's really nice.

17:25:34 Participant: You hiked too?

17:25:36 Coach: Yeah we hiked there, so there's like different levels of trails. There's like, easy, medium and hard, and then we did all three easy hikes in that one day. We didn't get to do any of the medium or the hard hikes because it was snowing. And, yeah I think a lot of those higher level hikes were closed. So, that's okay we ended up buying the pass, so hopefully we can go back another day.

17:26:07 Participant: Yeah. Was there a lot of people? We're going next month, but I think they're going to start like requesting reservations.

17:26:17 Coach: Yeah, well if you're staying the night then I think you do need a reservation but I think if you're just visiting you could just drop in. But yeah, I'll send you a couple places like nearby since you live in the Bay right?

17:26:41 Participant: Now I live in Sacramento. I like it so far, like, I don't... my boyfriend drives, and I don't like to sleep, because I feel like we're going to crash or something. But I always... I feel so tired. And I'm like "why is... why do we... why... how come we don't have a beach nearby, like why Sacramento doesn't have a beach near."

17:27:09 Coach: So, there's somebody near you. And then there's another one. If I remember off the top of my head but I feel like it's Cornwall or... Cornish, Cornell, I don't know, but I'll try to find it. I'll Google it and send it. There's nice places like near the Sacramento area too, it just, you have to look for them.

17:27:38 Participant: I did a hike in Sacramento, or like an hour. Never again, I'm like, "no, I will not be hiking in Sacramento." Everything was dry. I was like "if I'm going to go hike I'm hiking near the beach and that's it."

17:27:54 Coach: Yeah, I think the one that I'm thinking of like sending you is like, it's a short little two mile hike. But let me see if I can think of the name. Well there's Stanislaus National Forest, but I've never been there. Yeah, I'll try. I'll look more closely a little later. So I'm transitioning a little bit towards your health goals for the week. Were you wanting to do something around the same like the tortillas and the water or did you want to try something else?

17:28:56 Participant: I want to try like working out. I haven't... remember I told you I started running? My sister went to Mexico, so I don't have nobody to go with. And I'm kind of scared to go to the park but she comes back tomorrow. So I don't know, something about like jumping jacks or 50 jumping jacks a day or something.

17:29:39 Coach: What kind of direction do you want to go? I'll say 20 minutes of a workout.

17:29:50 Participant: And in the next week, yes, you will work out 20 minutes, and then a day, every day, or do you want to do three times?

17:30:11 Coach: I know three times... like, five days out of the week?

17:30:15 Participant: Five days out of the week, or the seven days?

17:30:22 Coach: And then do you want to specify which days do you want to work out?

17:30:29 Participant: Monday to Friday.

17:30:32 Coach: So, no weekends?

17:30:34 Participant: No.

17:30:36 Coach: And then, is there a time that works best for you to work out like before going to work or after coming home, when's a good time?

17:30:49 Participant: Usually, I would say like 8pm. I'm done with class at that time whenever I do have class.

17:30:59 Coach: And then you kind of use the word like "workout" very loosely... I'm sorry that sounded really judgmental. I just mean like workout can mean a lot of things. So, do you want to do like a 20 minute YouTube video or do you have your own routine?

17:31:20 Participant: I have an app. It's called Female Fitness. And it tells... it gives me different workouts so I'm pulling it up. So it tells me what I want to work on. So I usually do like a full body, and it's about 20 minutes.

17:31:44 Coach: So you'll use the app Female Fitness. So, I'm going to throw kind of a scenario out there. And it's coming from personal experience. So, you know, you set this goal. "I'm going to work out for 20 minutes at 8pm," because it's after school, it's after work or just like "this is a time that I'm available to work out." 8pm comes around, and you're like, "boy, I've just had a really long day. I just want to watch TV or, I just want to not move." Do you feel like that's something that you may experience?

17:32:37 Participant: I think only Thursdays because my class is over at eight. I don't watch TV or anything. So I really have no excuse not to do it. I just have to push myself. Maybe drink... like I've noticed if I drink my protein before, then I have more energy, instead of, if I don't drink protein or anything like that there's no way I'm going to work out for 20 minutes.

17:33:13 Coach: So drinking protein before your workout will help you. Okay, so, I'm curious like would making your protein powder or making your protein drink at like 7:30 or like at 7:45, like what time should you start preparing the drink and then how can it help you meet your 8pm-ish time?

17:33:47 Participant: So I've also noticed... I found, wearing like if I'm wearing jeans there's no way I'm working out. So, I am going to switch to my workout clothes at six. Drink my protein around that time, or seven. And then I can be ready by eight. If I'm wearing a different outfit I wore for work, I just don't feel like washing another outfit.

17:34:32 Coach: And then, so you mentioned like Thursday being kind of a difficult day. It's worth... this goal is your goal for the week. Do you think that Thursday's, you're going to make it through Thursday?

17:34:44 Participant: I will try my hardest to make it through Thursday, just because I need something to just forget about class, instead of just turning off my computer and then going to sleep or showering. It's just I need something to give me energy.

17:35:05 Coach: So, here's what I have for you and then you let me know how it sounds and how confident you feel. So in the next week you will work out for 20 minutes for five of the seven days specifically Monday through Friday at 8pm, you're going to use the Female Fitness app to help you decide the workout. You're going to drink a protein or get the protein drink before. And you're going to switch to your workout clothes around 6pm, and all of this will help you decompress from your day. So on a scale of one to ten, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

17:35:58 Participant: I would say eight.

17:36:01 Coach: I think you said five out of the seven days, didn't you?

17:36:05 Participant: I'm not supposed to start today.

17:36:08 Coach: So, it's five out of the seven days, you said Monday through Friday.

17:36:16 Participant: Oh, I hope I didn't... but totally unless it was started today.

17:36:25 Coach: Unless you want to do something on the weekend?

17:36:27 Participant: No, I did say five, sorry yeah it was like I think you said five.

17:36:38 Coach: Okay, so today at 8pm. And I'm already... I'm already in my workout clothes. So then the next step would be to prepare your protein drink. So how does... do you feel like you need any like support from me to help you meet this goal like whether that be resources or something else?

17:37:05 Participant: I think I'm okay.

17:37:08 Coach: And then, did you want to set another goal for yourself or do you feel, this is good?

17:37:19 Participant: I think this is good just because I've been trying to work out and I haven't found the energy so I really need to push myself to do it.

17:37:33 Coach: I think, you know, with people who have set workout goals before they've noticed like an improvement in their overall like feeling of happiness... like working out has increased their happiness so I don't know if that helps motivate you. Okay, let me see if there's anything other than... do you have... was there anything else you'd like to talk about or check in about?

17:38:20 Participant: I can't think of anything at the moment.

17:38:25 Coach: That's okay. This is good. So just to remind you, then that we're meeting, I think next week at the same time. Does that still work for you?

17:38:37 Participant: Yeah, that's gonna work for me.

17:38:41 Coach: And then I'll check in with you over text message. Hopefully that helps. And I'll email you later tonight with a summary of today.

17:38:54 Participant: Awesome.
