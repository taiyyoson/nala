12:04:46 Participant: I have a degree in psychology. I'm focusing on Marriage and Family Therapy. So I'm about to finish my first year this upcoming semester.And before that, I went to undergrad at SF State, so I've been in San Francisco for like six years now.Um, my goals—I’ve never had a health coach before. I have a therapist. It's like, I feel like it's similar except like I don't vent to you about personal problems. But I do have somewhat of an idea of what a health coach can help with. And I think what I want to focus on is goal setting in terms of my physical health, and work a little bit more on, also—I guess it ties together—like my self-confidence with my physical health. And so those two are super important for me. I'm focusing on these because in my therapy I focus on mental health more, so I kind of want to keep these two separate so that I can really hone in and take as much as I can from these health coaching sessions.

12:06:04 Coach: I think you put it perfectly. And there are different things we seek when we need support. It sounds like you already know that you need support to maintain a positive mental health outlook and to help you manage anything related to mental health, which I think is absolutely great and much needed. I also think you bring up another good point. A lot of these things are interconnected. Mental health affects physical health, and physical health can affect mental health. I think it's great that you are able to identify each, but know that they're very interconnected. So my goal, as you mentioned, is to support you in your physical health. But know that you want to continue your mental health care because that's also going to support you and help you. So yeah. Any other thoughts about what you want to check in on, or what you hope to gain from the sessions?

12:07:17 Participant: Yeah, I think it's more like that health aspect.I really enjoy your texts. I don't know if it's just us sending them with someone else. I really like the ones that center around being grateful for life. I think that in the morning, reading them makes me feel like, "Yes." Like the one you sent recently—I read it and thought, oh yeah… my thoughts just started flowing, and my day got a little extra boost of, like, happiness. Even though there are improvements I want, it centered me on happiness. I really like things like that.

12:08:24 Coach: That’s nice.

12:08:26 Participant: I'm getting chills.

12:08:30 Coach: So every day, you will be getting a text message. It’s automated, sent to everyone participating. I can see your responses directly and reply to them. Keep responding. If you love a message, or if it brings up thoughts or questions, share them—I’ll do my best to respond.

12:09:15 Participant: Yeah.

12:09:16 Coach: Awesome. There was a specific message that stood out to you, and it motivated you to focus more on happiness. Keep noting if messages motivate you to do other things related to your health; it helps us improve the program.

12:10:06 Coach: Let me ask about stress. On a scale of 1 to 10, what was your stress level this week? One is not stressed, ten is very stressed.

12:10:28 Participant: I’d say like five. It’s right in the middle. I’m not stressed now, but I’m stressed about next week.

12:10:54 Coach: Sometimes planning ahead can cause that, but hopefully next week you’ll realize you’ll be fine.

12:11:05 Participant: Okay.

12:11:07 Coach: Earlier, you mentioned focusing on mental health. You want to focus more on physical health overall. How would you say you’re doing in meeting your past health goals?

12:11:29 Participant: If I had to rate it, I’d say a seven. I reach my goal, but I revert back to old habits. I can achieve goals, but maintaining them is the challenge.

12:12:27 Coach: Maintenance is key. Thinking about past successes, what do you want to focus on for the upcoming week? We’ll use SMART goals—specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely. The purpose is to set a goal this week. We’ll check weekly—if Wednesdays at noon work, we’ll check in again next Wednesday.

12:13:35 Participant: I think I’m trying to… what would be realistic and achievable. I’d like to try a new way to work out. I love running, but I want to get stronger. I’d like to try a workout that involves free weights, like dumbbells.

12:14:36 Coach: That’s a great goal. You want strength training, for arms or legs, using free weights. How about five minutes of strength training when you go to the gym—either as a warm-up or cool-down?

12:15:25 Participant: Yeah, I can do that. I like running, so this would just add a little extra.

12:16:16 Coach: For this upcoming week, how many days do you want to do strength training?

12:16:26 Participant: Four times, Monday to Friday. I’ll plan Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday because my weekends are more open.

12:18:25 Coach: Good. How will you remind yourself or measure progress? Duration?

12:18:55 Participant: Minimum of 20 minutes. I can use resources for strengthening videos. The gym gave me a free personal training session on Friday—I’ll ask for strength exercises to remember and do.

12:20:05 Coach: Perfect. Friday’s session can help you set up a 20-minute routine. Why is this important to you?

12:20:27 Participant: I want something new. I was never a runner in high school; I hated exercise. Moving to SF and seeing people run inspired me. Now I love running, but strength training is intimidating for me. I feel weak compared to others at the gym and I want a new challenge.

12:23:30 Coach: That’s a great way to start. You’ve challenged yourself before to become a runner; you can use those same skills for strength training. You’ve done it before—start small and gradually build strength, just like when you began running. There will always be opinions around you. Focus on yourself, your health, and your confidence. Strength training is also beneficial for bones and overall health. For this week, your goal is strength training, four times, 20 minutes. On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you in achieving it?

12:26:34 Participant: Six.

12:26:46 Coach: What’s the hesitation?

12:26:55 Participant: I can get to the gym, but I shy away from the weight area—it’s intimidating.

12:28:25 Coach: How about starting some exercises at home?

12:28:37 Participant: I have small dumbbells from quarantine. I’m excited for Friday’s personal training session; it will teach me correct form and boost confidence.

12:30:58 Coach: Anything else for this week, or just strength training?

12:31:05 Participant: Just strength training. I want a “me weekend” this weekend, to be alone in my apartment. I’ll put my phone on Do Not Disturb and read. Friday and Saturday. Those are the hardest days to disconnect.

12:34:51 Coach: Good. You’ll measure progress by completing reading time.

12:35:25 Participant: Confident about this? Solid four.

12:37:22 Coach: Put Do Not Disturb on your computer too.

12:38:35 Participant: Confidence now? Solid nine.

12:39:34 Coach: I’ll send an email summary of your two goals. Write them down and track them in your planner.

12:40:31 Participant: Wednesdays at noon are good for check-ins for the next few weeks.

12:41:11 Coach: Great, we’ll send calendar invites. Check in next week. Remember to disconnect.

12:41:26 Participant: I will.
