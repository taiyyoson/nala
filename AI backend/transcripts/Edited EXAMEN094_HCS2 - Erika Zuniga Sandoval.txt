10:01:02 Coach: Good morning.

10:01:04 Participant: Morning.

10:01:07 Coach: How are you today?

10:01:09 Participant: A little sore, but good.

10:01:12 Coach: That's a good feeling. I like it. So, how did you do with your goal this last week?

10:01:20 Participant: I did pretty good. I just missed yesterday. Yesterday was super stressful, so I told myself, “You know what, not today, Anthony. You need a break.”

10:01:30 Coach: You mentioned it was quite stressful yesterday, but overall during the week, how would you rate your stress level on a scale from 1 to 10?

10:01:43 Participant: Probably like a 2 or 3. It was a pretty bland week. It was just yesterday that was chaos—but it ended really well, so I’m fine.

10:01:54 Coach: Okay. And in terms of your progress with your goals, on a scale of 1 to 10 how would you say you’re doing in meeting the goal you set for yourself?

10:02:14 Participant: I’d say like a 9. But I sprained my ankle over the week, so I wasn’t able to run. I told myself I’d deduct that 10 minutes from working out, but instead today I said, “No—we’re going to go on a walk instead of a run.” So, yeah. I’m pushing myself but trying not to overdo it.

10:02:34 Coach: I think you brought up a great point—that sometimes we need to adjust. Maybe you couldn’t run, but you could walk, and that’s still aerobic activity. Well done. That’s a great modification, and it’s part of problem-solving too. What else did you want to check in about today? What do you want to focus on for this upcoming week?

10:03:06 Participant: Thank you. Um, I’m not too sure. The one thing I’ve been really bad at lately is eating breakfast. I honestly don’t like breakfast food, and I don’t have much of an appetite in the morning. But I wake up starving—like my stomach growls off the charts—while at the same time my brain is like, “You don’t want any of this food.” So I think I want to work on being more consistent with eating breakfast. Even if it’s just a bar or a bowl of cereal. Because I’ve noticed if I don’t eat breakfast, the rest of my eating patterns for the day get completely thrown off.

10:03:55 Coach: Yes. I don’t know if you’ve heard this before, but let’s frame this around energy levels. A lot of programs talk about weight and weight management, but really, this is about fueling your body. You’ve been fasting 6–8 hours depending on how long you sleep, so your body needs something in the morning. What you give it doesn’t have to be complicated, as long as it’s somewhat nutritious. Even something small—like a granola bar or cereal—can help kickstart your day.

10:04:47 Participant: Yeah, I think the challenge is I’m a really picky eater. I was even pickier before, but I’m starting to expand my palate. Like, I know I should probably eat an apple in the morning, but my brain doesn’t process that. If there was a slice of cake, I’d eat that instead. It’s bad. I don’t know how to shift my mindset to be healthier and less like, “I’ll just eat whatever’s in front of me.”

10:05:22 Coach: Okay, let’s brainstorm some ideas that feel like a treat but are healthier. For example, I’ve heard of cutting up apples, sprinkling cinnamon on them, and baking them in the oven. People say it makes them taste like dessert. Maybe you could prep something like that the night before, warm it up in the morning, and trick your taste buds and brain into thinking, “Oh, I’m having dessert.”

10:06:04 Participant: That’s a good point. It reminds me of growing up—my dad used to put cinnamon sugar on bread and butter. I loved that. So yeah, I think it’s smart to figure out what I can create that I’m willing to eat in the mornings and have it ready.

10:06:39 Coach: Exactly—trick the taste buds and the brain a little. So you’re thinking of having breakfast in the morning. How many days this upcoming week do you want to focus on that?

10:06:57 Participant: Hopefully every day, because I wake up starving. It’s uncomfortable—I wake up at like 5 a.m. with my stomach growling, but I don’t want to eat anything. So I just drink water. Sometimes I sneak in a granola bar, but then by 10 a.m. I’m starving again.

10:07:29 Coach: Okay, so when you’re thinking every day, is that five days of the week or seven?

10:07:35 Participant: Probably seven.

10:07:43 Coach: Great. Can you think of something with protein you could include in the morning? I’m asking so we can visualize what it would look like. For example, tomorrow morning you’d know, “Okay, I can have this.” That way you don’t have to decide in the moment.

10:08:13 Participant: I’ll need to look up foods with protein—I’m bad at that.

10:08:18 Coach: Okay, that makes sense. Some options are cottage cheese with fruit, or yogurt with fruit. They’re simple, quick, and give you protein. Just be careful with flavored yogurt—it tends to have a lot of added sugar.

10:09:23 Participant: Yeah, sugar is an issue for me. My partner even jokes that I’ll probably be diabetic by 30. I drink a lot of soda and eat too much sugar. That’s basically my main source of fuel, which is why I feel so low-energy all the time. So I want to work on cutting down on junk food too.

10:10:03 Coach: Okay. You already have those foods at home, so maybe allow yourself to finish what you’ve got, but once they’re gone, don’t restock them. I’m a believer in baby steps. If we cut out everything suddenly, our body rebels and we crash. Little by little, you adjust your taste buds.

10:10:55 Participant: Yeah, definitely. Maybe I should try some new foods this week. I know there are lots of fruits I’ve never tried, especially with spring and summer produce coming in.

10:11:14 Coach: That’s a great idea. Buying in-season produce also tends to taste better. Okay, so we have a goal: eating a morning meal all seven days this week. How confident do you feel about being able to do this?

10:11:40 Participant: Like a 6. I still don’t really know what I’d eat in the mornings.

10:11:55 Coach: Okay. Let’s think of something you’d enjoy. Smoothies are a good option. Do you like smoothies?

10:12:04 Participant: Yeah, I like smoothies.

10:12:08 Coach: Great. You can make them with frozen fruit, yogurt, or milk—super simple. You could even throw in spinach; it blends right in and you can’t taste it, but you get the nutrients.

10:12:27 Participant: Oh yeah, I’ve done that before. It’s not bad.

10:12:32 Coach: That way you’re sneaking in veggies too.

10:12:38 Participant: Yeah, I like that idea.

10:12:44 Coach: Okay, so smoothies could be one option. Do you like eggs?

10:12:50 Participant: Not really.

10:12:54 Coach: Okay, so maybe French toast with whole grain bread could be a fun option—it feels like a treat, but it’s healthier.

10:13:11 Participant: Ooh, that sounds good.

10:13:15 Coach: You can make it quickly too. Eggs, a splash of milk, dip your bread, cook it—top it with fruit instead of syrup.

10:13:29 Participant: Yeah, I could do that.

10:13:33 Coach: Awesome. So smoothies, French toast, maybe yogurt with fruit, or granola bars.

10:13:45 Participant: That sounds manageable.

10:13:50 Coach: Perfect. So that’s the plan for this week: breakfast every morning, seven days. Now, you also mentioned wanting to cut down on sugar. How many days do you want to focus on that this week?

10:14:13 Participant: Maybe start with three days—like Monday, Wednesday, and Friday—where I avoid soda completely.

10:14:28 Coach: I like that. That’s a concrete, specific plan. And on the other days, maybe just reduce the amount a little bit.

10:14:45 Participant: Yeah, that sounds doable.

10:14:50 Coach: Great. So we have two goals: Breakfast every morning (7 days) and No soda three days this week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

10:15:12 Participant: Okay, that works.

10:15:16 Coach: Excellent. Now, how are you doing with physical activity?

10:15:25 Participant: Pretty good. I’ve been consistent with workouts, but I might need to change things up.

10:15:36 Coach: Variety can help keep it fun. What do you enjoy most about your workouts?

10:15:44 Participant: I like lifting weights. It makes me feel strong.

10:15:52 Coach: That’s great. You’re building strength and confidence. Maybe you could mix in some stretching or yoga to balance it out.

10:16:08 Participant: Yeah, I could do that.

10:16:12 Coach: Awesome. And how are things going with your meals in general?

10:16:21 Participant: Okay, I think. I want to start cooking more instead of eating out.

10:16:32 Coach: That’s a wonderful goal. What’s one meal you enjoy making?

10:16:41 Participant: I like making beans and rice—it’s easy and filling.

10:16:49 Coach: Perfect. That’s nutritious and budget-friendly. You could add veggies or chicken for variety too.

10:16:59 Participant: Yeah, I’ll try that.

10:17:03 Coach: Excellent. So overall, we’ve got some clear goals for this week. Breakfast every morning, no soda three days, keep up workouts but add variety, and cook at home more often.

10:17:28 Participant: Sounds good.

10:17:32 Coach: Great. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind?

10:17:44 Participant: Not really, no.

10:17:48 Coach: Okay. Then let’s plan to check in again next week.

10:17:59 Participant: Works for me.

10:18:03 Coach: Awesome. Thanks for your time today.

10:18:11 Participant: Thank you.

10:18:15 Coach: Have a great week!

10:18:19 Participant: You too.

10:18:23 Coach: Take care.

10:18:27 Participant: Bye.

10:18:31 Coach: Bye.
