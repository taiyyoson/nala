5:31:03 Participant: Hello.

15:31:08 Coach: Oh, hi. Hi Alex, why are you so blurry.

15:31:11 Participant: I do look so blurry. It's probably the lighting. Sometimes the way that you set it kind of affects it.

15:31:20 Coach: That's true.

15:31:21 Participant: I'm doing okay. I just finished my last class, so I'm done for the day.

15:31:32 Coach: Yeah. What about you? It's warm in San Jose today.

15:31:42 Participant: Yeah, it's pretty though. I was outside during lunch and I was like, I need to get some sun, and the sun is pretty strong.My dad recently put some layer of something on the roof, so I feel like it keeps the house a little bit cooler. That's the good thing about that.I have a fan, and I've been thinking about turning it on, but first I need to clean it because I haven't used it in a while, so it's really dusty and I have allergies.

15:32:16 Coach: Allergies are the worse, definitely cleaning first. But we're here for you today. We're here to check in and see how you did during the week and how your goals went.

15:32:30 Participant: So did you do… I feel I'm going to move seats because I need the charger. I feel like I did pretty good on… I kept up with my meditating. Actually meditated every morning. So for working out ... I did it on Tuesday. Thursday I didn't do it, but I did it on Friday morning. On Thursday I woke up super late, and then I was like, I still have to get it done.

15:33:08 Coach: So you were able to do it on two days during the week?

15:33:10 Participant: Yeah, I did it on Friday, and then I did it on Saturday as well.

15:33:16 Coach: Yeah, so you did it on two different days.

15:33:22 Participant: Oh, three days. So I actually did more than I thought.

15:33:25 Coach: Yeah, pretty good.

15:33:30 Participant: Yeah, I was like, I gotta report back, so I need to do it.

15:33:33 Coach: Awesome. In terms of the progress itself, if you could give it a rating between 1 and 10, how do you feel that you did in meeting your goals?

15:33:46 Participant: Well, in meeting my goals, those two goals I added… yes, I would say a nine because I met them, but I feel like I wish I would have been more intentional about them, specifically the “move my body” one. I feel like I kind of put it in there because there happened to be time, but I want to prioritize it and stick to the days and times. I just feel like I need to prioritize it because then if I'm not prioritizing them, I'm not prioritizing myself.

15:34:28 Coach: Very true, very true. Yeah, that's a very good point.

15:34:32 Participant: Thank you.

15:34:32 Coach: In terms of your level of stress, I know there were a few things that came up. There were some really good things that came up…

15:34:41 Participant: There were some really good things that came up…


15:34:44 Coach:  Yes, congratulations. And what was your stress level during the week, from 1 not so stressed to 10 very stressed?

15:34:52 Participant: Um, I think this week it was probably a four. I wasn't very stressed. I think some of the things that stressed me out were like my professor hasn’t put the final assignment instructions for the vignette we have to do, and it's due on Saturday. I was like, come on, post it already. So I was a little stressed trying to figure it out, and everything on Canvas is organized, but other than that… I think the job application process… I don't know if I talked to you about how I'm starting to look for jobs.

15:35:35 Coach: Okay, so it's going good?

15:35:37 Participant: Because I feel like once you have the resume and the cover letter down, it's easier to just adjust and apply. But last week I completely avoided it, so that brought a little stress because I kept going in circles about it. But then I was also like, I gotta be kind to myself. It's okay, it'll get done. But yeah, I feel like what alleviated it was that one of my professors asked me if I was interested in a position that’s open in Santa Fe, which is not where I live. So I spoke to the lead counselor about it, and it went pretty well. I was like, okay, things are coming up, and I know that I will be aligned with something. One of my sisters also told me about how the district is opening up a bunch of different positions for counselors. So I think that's what alleviates the stress: the jobs are there, you just have to apply.

15:36:46 Coach: Yeah.

15:36:47 Participant: Yes. If you do not apply, there’s no way to get a good job, right? I always tell my sister, people are not just gonna come to your door and tell you, “Hey, here's a job for you.” Come and apply.

15:37:02 Coach: So what are you hoping to check in about today? I know you mentioned a little bit about what's going on with the dove hunting, but is there something specific that completely affects your stress level and mental well-being?

15:37:18 Participant: But are there other aspects that you wanted to check in about today? I think… I’m in this funk because I gained so much weight since quarantine and I really want to lose weight.

15:37:29 Participant: I keep going in circles about wanting to lose weight but also telling myself, “Okay, that's not the way to approach it. You want to be healthier, make healthier decisions,” but it's really hard for me to commit to healthier habits. I'm going to be completely honest with you: I struggle a lot, specifically on the weekends. I eat things I probably shouldn’t because they have a lot of salt or sugar, and I guilt-trip myself afterward.
 So I'm always in this cycle of “Okay, you did good this week, keep it up,” and then somehow I mess up, and instead of saying “Okay, tomorrow’s a new day,” I just keep going downhill. I struggle with that a lot, and it impacts my mental health. I go in these cycles of wanting to lose weight, but it’s not really necessary… I want to, but it won’t make me happier. I just get in my head a lot.

15:38:40 Coach: That’s normal when making changes. Sometimes we sit in ambivalence. Having an understanding of why it’s important for you to do it, asking those “why” questions, and goal-setting can help make small gradual changes. There will be good days and setbacks, and that’s part of change. We don’t move linearly; sometimes we loop back. I hear you, absolutely. To get started, we can focus on small goals. You’ve been working on meditation to manage stress, and you started physical activity, which can move you forward. You could start with physical activity consistently before adding anything else. Don’t try to do too much at once.

15:40:33 Participant: In the past, I tried, but it didn’t work. I used to go to CrossFit, but I stopped during the pandemic. I told myself to eat healthier because exercise alone isn’t enough.
I want to focus more on what I eat than physical activity for now. That will make me feel better mentally.

15:41:37 Coach: Yes, the 80/20 principle. We can make a SMART goal around foods you consume. Let’s start small, like one meal during the week. What do you typically have in the morning?

15:42:32 Participant: Usually eggs, sometimes avocado (I force myself to eat it), toast, and iced coffee or green tea. If I don’t have time, I don’t eat until lunchtime.

15:43:24 Coach: How many days a week do you eat breakfast?

15:43:41 Participant: With my new campus schedule, I often don’t have time. Maybe 3-4 times a week.

15:44:15 Coach: That could be a start: aiming for consistent breakfast. You could prepare meals the night before to grab and go. When thinking about weight, remember that eating helps prevent overeating later.

15:45:01 Participant: I tried overnight oats with peanut butter, berries, banana, oat milk, and honey. That worked at work. I also did boiled eggs to prep. It’s about prioritizing myself.

15:46:10 Coach: So for this week, what would you like to focus on?

15:46:24 Participant: Meal prep. I’m going to Costco after our session.

15:47:00 Coach: Let’s break it down: grocery shopping and cooking. You mentioned cooking takes about 1.5 hours.

15:48:02 Participant: I want to focus on Mondays because I have more flexibility.

15:48:43 Coach: Goal: 2 hours on Monday, including grocery shopping. And breakfast planning?

15:49:19 Participant: For Monday’s meals, yes.

15:50:19 Coach: Keep meditation too: 10 minutes, three days this week. How confident are you in doing the meal prep, scale 1–10?

15:51:05 Participant: I feel confident.

15:51:11 Coach: Make your grocery list; you can look up recipes for variety. How confident are you continuing meditation?

15:51:57 Participant: Solid, I can do it.

15:52:42 Coach: Any other successes or challenges?

15:52:56 Participant: The weekend challenge: I eat more than I should because I feel I must finish everything.

15:53:42 Coach: That’s common; sometimes kids are taught to finish all food, which can create habits. Portion vs. serving: serving measures nutrition, portion is what you actually eat. Understanding portions can help figure out if you’re eating too much or too little. Did you find the healthy plate video helpful for meal planning?

15:56:39 Participant: I didn’t get a video link.

15:57:17 Coach: It should be in the first cohort follow-up email.

15:58:03 Participant: Okay, I’ll watch that.

15:58:43 Coach: This week I’ll find more resources on portions and servings. I also send goal summaries via email.

15:59:28 Participant: I get many emails from USF events, Canvas, Career Services. I need to check them regularly.

16:00:06 Coach: Any messages stand out this week?

16:00:34 Participant: Why it’s important to know your “why,” to remind yourself to eat healthy and stay active. The “be active every day” picture was also really nice.

16:01:52 Coach: You’re doing great; I love it. You set good goals for the upcoming week. I’ll send a summary and resources.

16:02:28 Participant: I just need to follow through.

16:02:41 Coach: You'll do great.
