17:15:59 Coach: Hello. Hi.

17:16:02 Participant: I just got a text about I didn't accept it and I was like I didn't accept it. I didn't realize I didn't accept it. I'm sorry.

17:16:09 Coach: No, that's totally fine. I just didn't know if that like sneakily meant that you wouldn't be able to join which is fine, we can always reschedule. But that's that was why I asked because I was just like oh no I, I like forgot to send you the reminder text message.

17:16:29 Participant: Oh no. Totally fine like if I don't, it's probably just because like I didn't realize I had to but normally, I can't make things I like to let people know, just because I get annoyed personally when people don't remind me I like they don't tell me they're not going to make it until like the very last minute.

17:16:45 Coach: No worries. Either way, I'm the best so happy to see you. And I'm so like, what's going on with your eyes I'm so concerned.

17:16:54 Participant: That's like the weirdest thing so it first started actually when I went to visit in San Francisco for some reason something weird happened with my contacts so I just took them out. And I noticed I was still seeing a little bit fuzzy and it took a while for my eyes to go back to normal. And then the next day I had like severe like photophobia like I couldn't be like in the sunlight and I, it wasn't a migraine headache because I didn't have a headache at all. It was really just like I, I couldn't be in the sunlight. And that was the only thing bothering me and then it would just staying consistently, and I just, it was, it was a it's really weird what was happening, and eventually like it resolved itself so I was like that for two days. And like I said I know it wasn't a migraine because migraine just was a feel like a headache. But I felt no headache or anything else like it literally was only my eyes and I didn't know what it was. And then I was like okay it's a one time thing no big deal. You know, and then of course later on I found out sometime that the symptom of like having an ulcer on your cornea. Because I went to the then this last time it happened when I was with. When I was shadowing that pediatrician. I noticed something happened afterwards and I was like okay maybe my eyes are just dry, so I put in like eyedrops, but that only made it worse. weird right. And I couldn't see again and it was just like it but I, my mom thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to like the stuff that the pediatrician was using at her at her house or something we don't know. But I also for like two days I couldn't like open my eyes are like look in certain directions because it was just like pain my eyes. And it was, it was weird and the like. And again the only reason why I was kind of fine afterwards because again we went out for dinner but that was like at night. So like, of course, like I didn't really sense much of the lighting, cuz we were seated outside and was like dim light. So again, like I didn't even realize and I thought okay maybe tomorrow. It'll be fine but no it was, it was awful. The next day, and I could only like look in certain directions. and they're like oh it's just like your sinus or something but I'm like, I don't think so. And then I like it's weird so I would like to the eye doctor of course on Monday cuz I was like we can take you to the ER and I'm like, I don't think you're a doctor is going to know what to do with eyes like they're probably going to be like, Oh, we don't know what's really wrong because again they don't do eyes they just do like physical body. You either included but there is like a specialty just for eyes and those special Just for like teeth. So, I wouldn't like if it was for my teeth I wouldn't really go to the ER for anything so like, same thing I thought for my eyes I was like no I know it's my eyes I need like an actual eye doctor. Sorry, go see him. And of course he started doing like rapid test and that's what he said he's like I just wanted to check you out really quickly because what you're experiencing it sounds like a corneal ulcer or something like corneal like issues, he's like, That's not good. So I just wanted to make sure it wasn't that and luckily it wasn't. But he didn't really know what it was either. So he told me to like again, kind of like, replace because they're soft contacts I know how you replace them like every month. So I just use it just replace them. And like, get a new case, I guess maybe in case the case had bacteria, and then I'm on antibiotics right now for my eyes because he's like, I don't know what it is but I just want to make sure like anything you could have just like flushed out and I go back on Monday to see like okay what's what's going on.

17:20:59 Coach: Again, I'm not like just based on a personal experience which is kind of similar. I became allergic to my contacts, like anytime I would put them in my eyes would just burn. Like, I'm not sure exactly what happened. But they ended up giving me like the one a day, so like the ones that like you throw in and throw out the same day, and then maybe do some like drops some stuff. And I think what was determined was that like my eyes started producing like a protein, like that was like the allergy to the contacts, I don't not sure, I don't know this piece. But, so like, now I can only wear contacts like every so often, and then even then, I have to like throw them out like for after like maybe eight hours like they can be in my eyes for longer than that, interesting because they did ask them to like, oh, like did you did you sleep with them on like no like did maybe like I opened my eyes under water and I'm like, no that's random sleeping in my contacts yeah so that that was that is shared I was like that This is fun. And then the issue also been is that on that Monday, I'm like, you know, cuz that it happened over the weekend, actually had a test on Monday for my neurobiology class. And so I emailed my teacher because I still like my eyes were still hurting still a little bit on on Monday, but it was getting to kind of get better. But even when my teacher and I was just like, I have like a little eye emergency, I'm going to the eye doctor but, um, could you give me like a like a 30 extra minutes on the exam so I can take my time, because it hurt me to even look at screens, like this. Another day, and I just asked for extended time because I could always do like you know the accessibility where you can like highlighting like you'd have a read out loud like I could do that, then he's like yeah sure you ever gave me like you know like than an extra 30, he gave me like the full two hours instead of like the hour. Okay. Okay, so they would like do the exam. Luckily, partially dilated saw a little proud, I got 91 So, killing it. Also, it just goes to show like your perseverance, you're like, No, eye emergency is going to knock me down.

17:23:48 Participant: I don't like, I don't like asking professors for like test extensions or like, I just feel weird asking for that, like there was one time where like last semester for evolution, there was a test and then right in the middle of my exam, there was a fire. So we had to evacuate the building. So I had an email a professor right then and they're saying they just leave having a fire at my apartment. Right now it's under control like but I can't be at my laptop right now so he extended my time. And he said, okay, just email me once I can. So that's, like, you know, a lot of time and then he just added on like that time that I took. He just added on to my exam. That way like again like I was fine. So yeah, these random things just happened to me, and it's always like very fast and I don't enjoy that it's like I'm already stressed from a test but now like life is just wanting to add on top of it.

17:24:57 Coach: Um, and also sneaky segue into my stress question. On a scale of one to 10 What was your stress level this week?

17:25:18 Participant: I mean also including with work and some of the stuff that I had to do for that, I'd say like around like... honestly I was expecting it, and you're such a trooper. I know how to manage my stress actually very well. Like I would like my mom would like whenever since I was little, my mom like would teach me ways to kind of like, kind of compartmentalize certain things so I can deal with it at certain times. And then, when you look at everything as a whole, you kind of freak out because you're like, Oh, I had to do all this but if you break it down and you really like have more time. So that's kind of what I do now I kind of break it down and I'm like, you know, into little pieces like and figure out what is it actually do. And like, it's a little bit easier that way so now I doesn't do that a little bit naturally. Why did it go building a high five to your mom.

17:26:14 Coach: Um, and so this is, you know, going to your to your goal of last week which was to do the painting. I know you experienced some barriers, but what do you want to say, or okay sorry let me ask like the specific question on a scale of one to 10. How did you do in meeting your goal?

17:26:38 Participant: I think I still do like pretty good and I still like you know like a solid nine.

17:26:43 Coach: Yeah and I decided to do a little bit different because I really couldn't like see that one so I did like I really like I did a quick painting and then I decided to do. Actually, I'll just I'll just show you. Yeah.

17:27:06 Participant: Okay, so I made these little hands. Um, this actually, and this didn't take me actually that long to do the little. Oh so cool. Yeah, so I just like the little hands. And they're meant to like hold like this kind of like intertwined. And then this is this is like the painting.

17:27:35 Coach: Oh, cool. so it looks like yellow shut the front door they work together.

17:27:45 Participant: Yeah, it's kind of like the whole star crossed lovers thing going on.

17:27:49 Coach: Oh my goodness. Can you send me a photo.

17:27:49 Participant: Oh, yeah I did I'm gluing them down. That's why I like a solid 10 but like it's pretty good money I spend multiple hours on it actually like in one day because like you know, once you make a fracture time and second cuz I just kind of was procrastinating and I didn't want to deal with the stress.

17:28:12 Coach: Okay, well let's talk about that for a minute and also if you could send a photo. Awesome. But the goal was, I think, spend an hour each day for the project. Considering your circumstances like totally you had the cram. But I wonder like the part of the purpose of your health goal was to alleviate some of your stress like every day. So I guess I'm just curious like was doing it, stress relieving or stress inducing?

17:28:46 Participant: That was actually stress relieving because I was just like more concerned with, you know, what was happening. So it helped me like to relax and kind of calm down from the stress, cuz I also spent, because my eyes and how they were I literally spent the whole day kind of with my eyes closed. So for fun I was just like, you know, let's see what it's like being blind and yes and then so I just started like feeling around things and I just like I became like a baby I literally just wanted to feel random things. And that was like my way of relaxing so I touched something soft or like might be so high like Play-Doh so I just started messing around with the Play-Doh.

17:29:30 Coach: Well, I think that was a really awesome painting. I want to send that to my to my, my other coaches and be like well look at this awesome thing, I already told them that you got into medical school. They said fantastic that is because, you know, you're lucky, but. So I'd really like to showcase you in that way. If you're okay with it.

17:29:56 Participant: Yeah, that's fine.

17:30:01 Coach: Um, so another, you know, random or not random but like another standard question I have for you is around the text messages. Um, did any of them stand out to you to any of them motivate you. Did you like some more than others did you hate any of them kind of just like over overall?

17:30:25 Participant: I just consider hate a very strong word I never liked this like yeah like this one's like better for me. Um, I like the one like they have like the different like pictures on there because like, I'm a very visual person so when it comes like in that kind of format I'm like, oh, like, okay, so it catches me a little bit more than like normal text do. But I did like the one were going to be about sleep because that was like, what does it say on Friday. That was the day where we decided to celebrate of me getting into medical school with margaritas. So, I was fun, but then I looked at I was just like, yeah you know I do need more sleep so I I worked on trying to like, what does it call like not get on a sleep schedule but I kind of worked on, like, looking at my phone less before bed to see if that would help me like fall asleep faster because I have trouble like falling asleep. And then normally like if I wake up in the night I do have a bad habit of looking at my phone and I know like you're not supposed to do that because like it kind of awakens your brain, it was a kind of just lay there, but I get bored. So like, that was good, a good reminder. And then of course, when I get the ones where it like reminds me about healthy eating. The thing that I like being back in San Antonio is that they have a lot of like little fruit vendors. And then you can just go and you can just buy like, you know, just a bunch of like different fruits and you know they come with like you know chili and everything. And it was always like my favorite thing because it's so accessible here in San Antonio versus like in San Francisco, I feel like you have to like, specifically, go to the mission. And like we don't like, I don't like continuously having to go to a very specific place to get good fruit. And I like are here like it's just easier to go to like kind of everywhere close by and I can find something.

17:32:37 Coach: The on Tuesday, we sent you a message around like the fruit cups

17:32:45 Participant: That was so good. They are like know my favorite thing we go to Mexico all the time when I was little, because it was like right there next to my grandma's house. So, like, you know, just like a 15 minute drive and then like we'd walk across like the little bridge, you know, and then we go, we'd like eat like little cups or they could have. I never knew what they were called, but I didn't realize elotes and esquites were, you know, they were different when he was like. So like, when the guy asked if I wanted like I forgot what kind of peanuts they are but they're the ones who like caramel around them. And then the deal would be hard because they would be so fresh. And I remember he gave me like a large packet and then he, he was like oh but I especially, and I was like okay so I gave him $3 and when he saw the $3 he started like packing a lot. And then, and I was like why she gave me so much and my mom like freaked out she's like no no no and then she, so she she told me she gave him back this up but she like you know you can keep the $3 but she explained to me that they different currency so I supposed to know like. Money's money.

17:34:01 Coach: Yeah. Oh, he didn't like trying to like scam you and say like, Oh, this is what you asked for. So let me take your $3

17:34:01 Participant: Yeah, very nice of him not to ya know like I have very fond memories of crossing the border and having like again like the different fruits there like I always consider Mexican food so like the best fruit. Hello Mango Mango tastes so nice. And I'm like, I'm so good over here, over there, but like, like I know we imported in from them but I'm like, you know, so yeah we have to like, pick it before it's right because of like processing and whatnot.

17:34:37 Coach: Um, so thank you for sharing. Any other comments about the text messages? Um, so, with our time today. We're sorry about all the notifications, um, what, what do you want to focus on what's calling to you this week or today?

17:35:08 Participant: Honestly like definitely sleep I feel like to start developing better sleep habits because I have atrocious sleep habits and I honestly just think it's because like in was in okay so like honestly like since I was in third grade I'd started waking up randomly throughout the night, and my mom used to having to keep this sleep journal literally just so we can keep track of how much I was sleeping because she noticed that I just like not sleeping all the way through. And then I got worse in high school because you know you do like morning sports like you have early morning practices. So I continuously wake up, you know before five in the morning because I had to be at school by six and I live like you know 40-45 minutes away from school. So I live far away so I would have to wake up earlier, and so sometimes if they want to like oh I'm gonna do 5:30 practice I'd have I'd have to be like, absolutely not. Absolutely not, I'm not going to do that to myself, because again. Sometimes you'd have double practices where you do you know an hour in the morning and then our in the afternoon. And that was just like, I mean I'm like I didn't like that, but I still want to do sports to keep myself busy, but like again. So my sleep habits were bad then. And then I would take trips sometimes like, you know, just a couple of times to like different countries and that was like, kind of like again jet lag. So, again, an odd sleeping schedule. And then I go to San Francisco which is again, you know it's only two hours but two hours kind of makes a difference when you're waking up in the morning and when you're going to bed like that, that makes that makes a difference. So I just I just never have anything consistent. And even with my job like it's inconsistent with how I do my sleep so it's like I just need the better habits I can fall asleep faster.

17:37:10 Coach: So, um, tell me a little bit about what your current. I know okay you've shared a lot kind of like about the history but like, you know, what time do you go to sleep. What's your bedtime routine?

17:37:27 Participant: I go to sleep around like it ranges from. Can you like. like sometimes one, but typically like from 10 to 12:30, like, those are like the times when I'll go to sleep. And if I'm really tired, then it'll be like around nine. But then again, like when I wake up, like the earlier I go to sleep. Like the, like, the earlier I'll still wake up. So I get like a consistent like four to five hours of sleep and I don't think that's how much I'm supposed to be getting, but that's how much I've conditioned myself to function off of and I know that's not healthy because even adults are meant to get around seven hours a song cutting myself like several hours short, and I take naps. I mean, I don't mean to but I just do because I'm tired. and you know they range between like an hour to two hours which I know that's not supposed to be like a nap. And yeah, I know that a nap is about 20 minutes but 20 minutes for me is just like what is this. So, Yeah it's just a few minutes to close my eyes and do anything.

17:38:56 Coach: And I think you're, you're right in that you are you know you're doing yourself a disservice by not getting 4-5 hours of sleep and your body kind of reminds you that you need that sleep and so you end up napping for one to two hours. I want to just kind of give yourself props for the way that your body has taken care of you, this whole time you're, a busy person. You have a lot of goals. not thrive. and so we need a nap. So, it's your you know your body is trying to take care of you care, take care of you in the ways that I can, and also like has trouble with the, with the consistency piece because of the lifestyle, right. So, I think, while we work on this goal. You know you want to be mindful of the lifestyle as well. So how you were staying like the soccer in the morning and the soccer at night or sorry, the activity in the morning activity at night. And then, you did a good. You did good by setting that boundary of like not. So like setting more boundaries in that way that promote and prioritize your sleep is essentially, my, my spiel. Does that sound okay?

17:40:31 Participant: Yeah it's like it's also sometimes hard to gauge how tired I am just because like, and I suddenly get I'm still need to find some way to get myself tested for like ADHD, but my mom says it's just a hyper thing because both me and her like we literally run on motors, no matter what like we can be tired but we're going to be like running like motors throughout the day. And we just keep on going. And like we just have like an endless burst of energy, and I shouldn't for how little sleep I get but I do and it's a little bit weird, but I know like it's it's not a normal level because my mom used to tell me like, oh yeah they're having a hard time and I said well why we do the exact same schedule and she was like we have just so much energy. And I'm like, Mom. I don't know, I mean like I was five years old asking my mom like running around the yard. And I would ask me why are you running around I would just, if I have to blow it out, I have to waste energy like every kid has to but the fact that I would be playing continuously at like, like daycare and then come back home and have to exert more energy, like...

17:41:51 Coach: I say, I don't want to label it like normal or not normal, but I'm. And of course I'm not a expert in this, but with the couple of things that you said some behavior can be learned. And so if your mom presents in this way, then you probably adopted a lot of her mannerisms, are not around when I was like, Oh really, my, my mom was always a workaholic. So she was always at work that I was primarily with my dad and my dad's a very mellow man would consider yourself.

17:42:40 Participant: I can share a cross between the two I have my moments of when I'm just like, and then but I have to like, and then I have to slow down because my dad has to like remind me be like me huh, stop and I'm like why, but he's like the world is the world's there, Mike and remind yourself you're on the planet and then it's like, Oh, you're right, dad.

17:43:08 Coach: Grounding. And so, you know, it's possible that they knew you could still get tested for ADHD if you want. There's ways that we become functional to survive. Especially if we experience pressures from ourselves or from other people. Like, we adopt. I'm sorry.

17:43:32 Participant: The reason why I also say that is because I have different people that they're like, I worked with them but their teachers and they specifically teach children with ADD ADHD. And so, I remember this, she just started asking me all these random questions. I don't know she was screening me. But I felt like she did because I kept on looking at she's like, how do you know these things and she's like well I have ADD, and I was like, oh, then she's like, and these are the screening questions I ask these children, and I was like, Oh, and I went to go see SDS to get screened by them to see if maybe it's like worth doing because again I cost money on it. and my guys like me very surprised that you didn't. I was like, sorry you can just. You can't just. He's like you're doing really well and then he's like your mom actually helped you cope with it by teaching you these different skills you probably didn't even realize that you teaching your skills to cope that by mom. Teach Yourself those skills because my mom's the exact same way as me, and it runs in the family My cousin also has it.

17:44:57 Coach: What has your experience or research said about like ADHD and sleep like those intersections?

17:45:08 Participant: That's poor Like, like, like I genuinely mean like when you look at like when you look into it and do research, just because of like how the brain is it's typically people with ADD ADHD they have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Yeah. And then there's someone that I know that was actually diagnosed with ADHD and she also has like she does have trouble, also with sleep so I'm like, Okay, Interesting.

17:45:43 Coach: Let's see. Um, so I looked this up and you're totally right. Okay. How do you get sleep with ADD, let's just operate on the assumption that there's a range of like sleeping, tips, and there's going to be some overlap with like ADHD or ADD and ADHD. This article that I'm looking at specifically says ADD, but these are things that we can recommend to anybody, not just like people with ADD Yeah. So tip number one, use the bed, only for sleep for sex, not as a place to comfort problems or argue. So maybe like no working in bed that's, I would add to that one. Like just using the bed for sleep. Do you have a desk?

17:46:56 Participant: Not in my room my dad's been hogging it because he's been working from home.

17:47:04 Coach: Um, so, I would also recommend yeah like not working from your bed, if possible, and do you have like one of those foldable tables. Yeah, like the ones that you take for picnics or something. When I didn't have a desk, I used one of those unlike just brought in a kitchen chair. Because desks are expensive. Anyways, Second tip, have a set bedtime, and a bedtime routine and stick to it, rigorously. So I think you're doing a really good job by setting a health goal around this. The third one, hear me out. Avoid naps during the day. You know it. I know what you're telling me is a great theory, but the application might be like a three out of 10 not gonna lie. So now that we have a little more information. I can give you like a wide range of like other sleeping tips if that's what you're interested in, but I think these were three really solid ones to start off with, regardless what what's calling to you, what based on what we've gathered, where do you want this sleep goal to go?

17:48:28 Participant: What do you mean like where I wanted to go like what I expect to gain from better sleeping habits or?

17:48:28 Coach: Um, so I guess the tips that we talked about have like, set a bedtime routine. Right, or go to bed at the same time so your sleep goal could be like. In the next week, I will go to bed at 11pm sharp, no ifs ands, or buts. So like being strict with that time. It could be like, I'm not going to take naps. or. This is going to be my bedtime routine I'm going to brush my teeth. I'm going to change into my pajamas, I'm going to read for 20 minutes, and then go to sleep, no phone, like, so it can take you in a lot of directions but what direction would you want to go in?

17:49:22 Participant: Honestly, a, I would probably try to do like the first one which is to use my bed, only for sleeping because I do have the habit of kind of just like working in my bed or like doing stuff on my bed just because like it's just really easy just to sit down and just like roll around. But I do have a chair, and I don't use it I kind of it's kind of like the stacker, you just, you know, you just have that one chair that contains all your clothes. Yeah, it's that chair you know the chair that I normally use a chair for, but I could, I do have a foldable table so I might use that instead. And I'll use that chair for doing all my work. That way I can start. I guess getting my body used to we sleep in the bed, we don't stay alert on the bed. So us desk and chair for work, rather than bed.

17:50:23 Coach: So you will only use your bed for sleep, sleeping, resting. I think sometimes we rest. And then, do you feel like this is a pretty solid goal that you can keep for the whole week. So every day.

17:50:42 Participant: Okay, so you will use your bed for for only for sleeping and that is only sleeping so that's resting for the whole week. And then, to help you with this goal, you'll get the chair and the desk. Cool, or the chair of the table, sorry.

17:51:11 Coach: I'm. And then, so we haven't specific we have it measurable because you can count each night seven times, you have, it's obtainable because you have a bed, and you have all the other supplies that you need. And then the relevant piece, like, why is this important to you?

17:51:35 Participant: to begin getting better sleeping habits, cuz like when I'm in med school I know I'm definitely gonna have to start using a desk and I can't just like be on my bed.

17:51:53 Coach: When you were living like are living on the dorm or on campus or wherever you lived. Did you usually like work from a desk?

17:52:07 Participant: I normally worked actually because I don't like the chairs are provided for us like I. It's really bad and actually picky. I like to be like the rolling chairs, I can just kind of like move myself when I get bored or something, because I have. So, I don't, I don't like the chairs they gave because the chairs only went up forward and backwards, and I like to move when I'm working so I can stay focused. And so the like you know the those type of chairs, I like but they didn't have that so I always just stayed on my bed because, and then bed can again like switch around different positions like.

17:52:54 Coach: Okay, so this is kind of like setting in a new habit overall. Yeah, cuz I yeah. Okay, we'll see how it goes, you, you know, get it, do you have access to a rolling chair?

17:53:01 Participant: Again, my dad owns that chair right now, it's literally his throne, man.

17:53:09 Coach: Can you steal it for a week?

17:53:12 Participant: I mean I have to have this other chair like, it's like one of those chairs, like, it's kind of like the lounge chair in a little way, it's like it's really comfortable. I like it I normally sometimes when I clean it out. It's like where I normally sit so I can read and relax.

17:53:31 Coach: Um, I want to be mindful of the fact that you like movement, while you study and work. Do you have like a fidget toy. And because if you're not going to be able to move your body in the lounge chair. Maybe I'm trying to think. What's a good fidget toy that people have handy.
