11:12:36 Coach: Morning.

11:12:40 Participant: Good morning, I think something's up. I should check my email. I've been on the computer most of the morning, but I was working on other things. No it's not something urgent.

11:12:58 Coach: Okay. Yeah. No worries. Yeah, I blocked off the whole hour. And I have some time until 12:15. Thank you. So how's your day going?

11:13:16 Participant: Good, good, good, good. It's a very busy week and it's getting busier and busier. But it just makes sense you know it's the end of the semester.

11:13:32 Coach: How has the stress level been this week on that scale of one to 10?

11:13:43 Participant: I've been having, I've been on the caffeinated side, so definitely I do feel, you know, wired. But I also do feel that I'm doing my best at managing my day to be balanced and still address all the things that need to be addressed even though there's usually too many things on my to do list and I don't get to all of it. So I think less than last week because this week I feel like I'm more, I'm more on the go go go go, like, you know, like, not waiting for things to happen and I'm tackling things that need to be addressed. So I'm on top of everything, that's what I mean. So I think less stressed than last week, but still, I would say six out of 10.

11:14:39 Coach: Six is ok. And how did you do with meeting your goals this last week on a scale of one to 10?

11:14:48 Participant: Yeah, it was 10 honestly. I did not think it would be. I thought it would be more challenging than it was. So that was really good. That was really good to realize that I wasn't spending that much time on Netflix. And also, I've been very mindful of the fact that I need to get my eight hours of sleep to get, you know. Yeah, no, I no longer have those, you know, groggy mornings. I don't want to be wasting time so I'm aware of it. Now that we put this goal in place, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was.

11:15:28 Coach: Good. I'm glad it didn't keep you up too late. So what are some things that you want to check in about today?

11:15:40 Participant: Um, I'm meditating every day and that has been very helpful. I've been trying something different. I'm getting my 20 minutes minimum. But I've been trying, I've been trying with dividing it into two. And having like this you know mindful moment in the morning and mindful moment in the afternoon. And I'm experimenting, seeing how it feels. I have my go-tos, you know, when I listen to the guided meditation. One is 20 minutes long and the other one's 30. So I'm trying, I'm doing those, but on top I'm adding this five minute one. And there's a 10 minute one as well. And I think it helps ground me, you know, like if I feel like I'm going to have so many things going on. And then I realize that I'm a little bit all over the place. You know, looking at the time and thinking like, Oh, actually, I do have, you know, 10 minutes to take a break and do this. I find it harder, the smaller meditations, because it takes me a couple minutes to get into that, you know, being present. Um, so the five minute one it's just me noticing all these thoughts. But it's, I find it, I find it to be productive. So, so that's really, that's been fun. I don't know why I started doing that but I thought I might as well, you know, try it and see how it feels to do a second time.

11:17:28 Coach: Oh, that's good. And I think breaking it down into like the chunks that work for you, it's the best way to do it because then you'll be able to achieve it. If 20 minutes feels like too long of a stretch, then 10 minutes might be a better time.

11:17:48 Participant: No, definitely, definitely. And no yeah, honestly, I've been surprised because I didn't try that before and I've been on a roll with it so I'm actually surprised.

11:18:02 Coach: Good. I'm happy about it because it makes a difference. So for this upcoming week, do you want to continue with the meditation and doing the 20 minutes in the morning and afternoon I think you mentioned?

11:18:19 Participant: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, definitely. I think I'm getting a good response, you know. So definitely want to continue with that.

11:18:39 Coach: And how many times during this week?

11:18:43 Participant: I've been doing it every day. So I want to continue on that.

11:18:50 Coach: And you did say that it was morning and afternoon. Also when you say every day that's seven days a week?

11:19:03 Participant: Yes, interesting. Yeah, seven.

11:19:07 Coach: And how confident do you feel about being able to continue with the meditation on a scale of one to 10?

11:19:15 Participant: And this new format, um, I would say nine, because I'm you know trying it out. I've done it in the past week. I've done it in the past three days, I think, three or four days. I'm a little bit confused. We're Thursday. So yeah, this week I started trying that out, and I want to see you know how it continues so I'm curious to see. I think I'm very confident that I can meditate for 20 minutes. But I'm wondering you know if I can consciously put, you know, create that 10 minute space twice a day. I think that'll be really really nice to try that out.

11:19:59 Coach: Okay. And is there another goal that you want to focus on for this week or maybe you want to just dedicate time to the meditation since there's a lot going on with end of semester?

11:20:09 Participant: Yeah, I was just thinking about that. Like I'm tempted, but at the same time I think that I'm getting so many benefits from doing this. And I don't feel like it's the right time for me to add something totally new. Yeah.

11:20:28 Coach: Yeah, I think you've got to space it out, feel it out and see how it goes. I would say definitely having at least one goal is a good. It's a good continuation and a good thing to continue to improve upon. Yeah, especially because before you were doing meditation, but in a different form and now it's still meditation, but it's breaking it down into two, two slots. So I think it's a good goal.

11:20:58 Coach: Any other challenges that you had this last week or successes that you want to share?

11:21:07 Participant: What's really working out well. The thing that's working out is that I've been more present. And that has allowed me to witness a little bit more my flows of emotions during my day and not be overwhelmed. Overwhelmed is not the term, but you know some mornings when you wake up and you feel like oh my goodness this day's going to be so long and suddenly you let that emotion take over how your day is going. When it was just you know an emotion, you know like just a feeling of overwhelm, of being overwhelmed or fearing not being able to accomplish everything. So it's really nice to be able to take that necessary distance. And sometimes it still takes over, you know, but not the entire day. It takes over but I don't let it, you know.

11:22:25 Coach: You don't dwell on it for as long.

11:22:25 Participant: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah, so that has been really nice to notice the difference. So it has been a success on its own you know. I don't know how to better describe it but I think that's something I noticed and I was happy to witness. And then, just being able to, as I said at the beginning, the other sort of the second success for me is you know I had this narrative of me, you know, wasting so much time and energy on Netflix, and actually I didn't when I, you know, actually looked at the time. It wasn't as dramatic as I had it, you know, in my head, like, oh my goodness all this time wasted whatever. Um, and I think it helps to put a timer on it and it also helped to pay attention. Just that awareness.

11:23:36 Coach: Yeah, sounds good. I heard you were going to figure out how to turn off that autoplay on Netflix.

11:23:43 Participant: Oh, you know what, I didn't check it but mainly the reason why is because I was watching this week, I told myself I did not know what to watch, and I ended up putting, there's this British channel I have. And they have, and I can record this TV show, and the TV show is half an hour, and I've been wanting to watch it. So it was, you know, and you have to press all these buttons to access recordings from your TV. So there wasn't that you know trigger of like oh the next one, oh the next one. But honestly I'm going to look at it right now because I'm just curious to know what the answer is in terms of does Netflix, what would it be called, maybe autoplay or next feature on Amazon or some. What am I saying Amazon, Netflix. Too many streaming things.

11:24:55 Coach: Oh, there you go. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, those are good keywords that you gave me to look for.

11:25:10 Participant: Right. Because as you know you're absolutely right and actually you're right yeah there's an option. It's already checked, autoplay next episode in a series on all devices and it's part of my profile, and I did not know that. So that's really, that's really important that I go and turn that off, you know, next time that I start watching a TV show. So that's really good. In fact, I'm surprised that I didn't think about it before because on my YouTube channel, whatever account, it was autoplay. It was set on autoplay and I hated that. And I made sure that, you know, that was no longer a thing. But I'm surprised I never thought about doing it for Netflix. I was just like, oh, that's how it goes, you know.

11:26:13 Coach: No seriously, no no no it's not and yeah that's what these conversations are for right? To brainstorm how to solve problems. Maybe the solution is there, we just haven't thought about it.

11:26:26 Participant: Exactly. No totally because honestly the world of Netflix autoplay was not always there on YouTube. But Netflix always came with autoplay. So it wasn't even on my radar that I could be you know changed. And, yeah, you know, it's silly but when you're consciously going and saying okay play next episode, it's different than just like, Oh, here comes the next one.

11:27:00 Coach: And there's so many studies on that, by the way, that's why they do it. They want to keep you there as long as possible.

11:27:07 Participant: Yeah, they want you to be a couch potato.

11:27:09 Coach: Absolutely, absolutely. So, so yeah, those are really positive, you know, changes. That's awesome. I'm glad to hear.

11:27:33 Coach: Going to the messages for this week. What were some of the messages that stood out to you this week? Were there any that sort of pushed you to take action?

11:27:43 Participant: Oh yes, the one about connecting with friends. It very much resonated, and even if I'm not like I'm talking to you right now so I'm noticing the link. But this week, compared to the past at least 18 months, I want to tell you this week I actually made conscious, you know, efforts to reach out to friends, and I'm always in touch with my friends. But reach out to those that I hadn't been in touch with, that I lost touch with, you know, because of the pandemic. Such a weird year. Everyone's, you know, moving in different places. So I got my phone and I went, you know, back in history. And I was like, Hey, how are you, what's going on, I want to know you know how you are and all that. And so that message of like reaching out and you know, to people and I think the text itself said, Go out and dance, you know, connect with a friend. So I had a really positive impact.

11:28:46 Coach: Oh, yeah. Yes, and I'm realizing now that if it says go dance with a friend, that might not be a doable thing right now.

11:29:11 Participant: Over FaceTime, it's not, it's not, but the idea of like, Okay, well, this is our current situation but it was for me was like okay reach out, you know, you cannot go dance like I highlighted that in my head, like, but I reached out to my neighbor, I reached out to a friend of my brother who's also one of my friends that I hadn't talked to in a very long time. And, you know, one thing is leading to the other and I'm connecting dots and it's good, it's healthy, you know. I feel like I have been isolating myself.

11:29:40 Coach: Yeah, yeah. Isolation is a huge public health issue right now. And we often think of it as, Oh, it affects a certain population. The population we often talk about is older adults. But right now it's affecting all of us because we're all in isolation due to COVID. So finding ways to stay in touch, whether it's virtual, whether it's texts, you know, calls, it does change how we feel and the way that we see our situation.

11:30:12 Participant: Absolutely. I hundred percent agree. And the thing, like the easy thing is to say like, oh, nobody cares, right? No one has reached out to me. And, oh my goodness it's so easy to get into that train of like, leave me alone, whatever. And I'm like I'm super uber positive but this year has been challenging. You know, like everyone else. But so, you know, making the effort and reaching out and checking in, has, you know, it may lead to my next, you know, project so it's been really good.

11:30:47 Coach: I'm glad that you reconnected. I have this tendency to delete all my text messages just because I like to have a clean inbox, but that actually then I forget to reach out to people.

11:31:03 Participant: Oh, but my rule is delete the ones that I feel that conversation has come to a close, like there's really nothing else I need to get back to them about, they don't need to get back to me about anything else. But I like to clean text messages and I honestly, so many times, I'm kicking myself. Because I also like to have that clean interface. And I think that's why I really like WhatsApp, because instead of having the choice between keep it or delete it, on WhatsApp you can archive it. And so you no longer see it, but it's there in your history. And so I really like that. It appeases both of my needs, you know, the need of like having a clean screen and the other one of like okay, I'm not going to forget the conversation that we had, you know, last year. And that's true. So many people that I connected with I checked. And our last conversation was March of last year.

11:32:14 Coach: Well now you reconnected.

11:32:18 Participant: Exactly, yeah so it's good. It's really good. I'm happy.

11:32:23 Coach: Any other topics that you want to check in about today? Today we mainly wanted to go over the progress you've made so you've made progress with meditation. And we of course want to address any barriers that you've encountered. And I think you've done really well at when things come up you find ways to problem solve around it. But if you need, if there's something that's sort of been lingering that you're like I'm not sure how to solve this, let me know and we can do some brainstorming around it. But I think you have a very solid action or goal for this upcoming week.

11:33:08 Participant: Yeah, absolutely. And you mentioned you have a 20 minute meditation that you already do. Did you need additional ideas on any of those? No because I grew up with a different one, and I recently graduated to this one. It's these new guided visualizations that I really enjoy. And each time it's a different experience and so you know, I'm good.

11:33:36 Coach: Yeah, I will let you use what you're using because it's working. So as every week, I'll send you a summary of the goal that we discussed for today. Today is our session three. There will be one more session next Thursday. And then at the next session, I'll let you know sort of what are the next steps and what happens after session four. You're still getting messages and you should continue to get text messages for the four weeks of the program. I'm trying to remember if your messages end next week. And I think you might still have some more messages until we meet next week so we should still be able to check in about a few more messages next time.
