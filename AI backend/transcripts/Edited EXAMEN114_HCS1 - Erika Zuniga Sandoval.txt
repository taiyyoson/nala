11:58:18 Coach: Hello.

12:09:28 Participant: Hi Jennifer, this is Erica. Sorry about the delay.

12:10:28 Participant: Yeah of course. Yeah I mean it's because I don't know if I told you in the email but I'm in the process of moving so I got internet... I think because it's like a new place, maybe they didn't connect it very well. So that's why I think the WiFi has been a little unstable lately so I need to kind of get that fixed. But thank you for calling.

12:10:58 Coach: No, no, no worries and thank you so much for making time in your schedule as I know you have a lot of things going on like moving. And that takes a while to all get settled in. So let's get started. And as I mentioned, my name is Erica. So I'll be your health coach for the next four weeks. And I want to give you just a quick introduction, and then transition into talking about goals and the health goals that you might have for this upcoming week. How does that sound?

12:11:21 Participant: Yeah, that sounds great. Thank you.

12:11:25 Coach: So first, as you've noticed, our program is sort of a two part intervention. One aspect of it is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving. You have been receiving those?

12:11:35 Participant: Yes, yes.

12:11:37 Coach: Yeah. And the second part is the health coaching. So my role as your health coach is to meet with you once a week. And that's, you know, we can do that through Zoom or over the phone. The goal is to do at least 20 minutes. And during this time we can check in about the daily text messages, what has been your thoughts on those, any goals that you have related to health and wellness. I'll also be asking you about stress level and how you're feeling about stress in this last week. And then we'll also go over just any other questions that you have. During the week, I'll check in with you to see how your progress is going. And if you have any questions or topics that come up during our sessions that I feel might be outside of my scope of work or expertise as your health coach, I will let you know what those limitations are and also connect you with appropriate resources. So this, as you know, this is a research study and we hope that we're able to collect a lot of useful data. However, any specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data that we gather will be sort of more aggregate data and de-identified. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing with us, or with me. By the end of the four weeks, we hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, as a way to help you manage any physical health goals, maybe spiritual or mental health goals that you also have. So we really want to thank you for choosing to participate in this program and we really hope that this program itself is going to help us to be able to figure out what are the needs of students and how we can provide them resources that can really benefit them. So it's going to benefit at a larger scale. Do you have questions before we get started?

12:13:51 Participant: No, I think I'll probably have questions as we go. And I think so far, no.

12:13:59 Coach: Perfect. And so in thinking about today, what are some of the things that you're hoping to check in about? And thinking of that too, I do want you to tell me a little bit more about yourself and sort of what brings you in, what interested you about the program, and within that, what are you hoping to check in about, what do you want to focus on, what do you hope to gain from your sessions?

12:14:28 Participant: Yeah, I mean I think overall it's just like perfect timing because I've been kind of having a little bit of like breathing problems that kind of... I wouldn't say heart problems because I haven't like officially gotten tested but you know I've been to the hospital sometimes and that kind of just made me realize that every time that I drink like any sugary drinks or that I eat, you know something that's like super spicy or that's not as healthy as I would hope it to be, then my heart like just increases a little bit. So the doctors have, in the meantime that I get tested and all that, they like kind of told me to stay away from any sugary drinks or you know those things. And I think for me, I love like sugary drinks and kind of snacks and things like that. So, I think I had to kind of take a step back and look at my stress levels, and also kind of my eating habits and then I need to make better choices with eating habits. And then now that I kind of moved, the big component is I think that I can eat healthier now because I'm going to have to be cooking all the time and you know I can do like food prep or something like that. And I think just the overall experience of moving out, it's like exciting. So I'm thinking like this could be kind of a start to me eating a little healthier, and just having a better, healthier living style than I kind of was before. Because, you know, it kind of has caused a little problem here and there. So, I think, just like perfect timing but that's kind of just some of my thoughts that I've been kind of thinking about.

12:16:15 Coach: Thank you so much for sharing. I think you brought up a lot of great areas that we can work on. You mentioned wanting to make changes in the way that you eat, making better choices, you mentioned food prep. You also brought up looking at your stress level. So let me ask you a little bit more about that. For this last week, on a scale of one to 10, one being not stressed, and 10 being very stressed, what was your stress level for this week?

12:16:47 Participant: This week if I have to pick, I would say like an eight, just because of the whole like moving and then also work and school. I think it's been pretty on the higher end.

12:16:59 Coach: Yeah, you have a lot going on as well, and remind me what year are you in school?

12:17:06 Participant: This is my second year in my master's program.

12:17:11 Coach: Okay. Yeah, so there's definitely a lot going on. This semester is almost coming to an end. Definitely lots and lots going on. So in the past, when you set your goals, so whether they're around health or wellness, how would you say that you've done in meeting those goals? So let's say if you also have to rate your progress for that on a scale of one to 10, and this is just for overall... Yeah, kind of like held up to today I guess, to give us like a baseline of where are you today in meeting your goals.

12:17:53 Participant: Oh, I guess I would say like, I'm in the middle like probably a five. Yeah, so I think once I kind of set my goals like I know that I can try and push them but recently I haven't been really taking care of myself so I think that kind of just puts me a little...

12:18:13 Coach: I think you bring up a great point that once we set goals, if we make them very specific, measurable, attainable, it can really help us to move them forward and that's actually one of the main things that we cover in session one when we meet with you today. I keep saying "we" because I am part of a team and I think I'm just used to it. I'm sorry. But as long as we're meeting today, I think that's something that it's important that we discuss - the setting goals. So what are your health goals that you have in mind for this upcoming week, and how can we measure progress, thinking also about why is this goal important to you? I think it's good for us to think about all those things. Is there something that you want to get started with for this upcoming week?

12:19:26 Participant: Yeah, I think, drinking water. I think I've kind of been, you know, not really drinking as much water as I told you in the beginning but I like sugary drinks more. But I think something that I really need to focus on this week, not only because like my doctors told me but because, you know, every time I drink sugary drinks, then my heart rate starts racing. So I'm thinking like drink more water this week, and staying away from any sweets, that I can, because especially when I'm at work, there's a lot of like snacks and candy and I'm like "oh there's a snack or there's candy, let me get one." So I think I need to kind of be better on saying no and drinking water. I don't know if that would be like an appropriate goal but that's just something that comes up.

12:20:09 Coach: I think that's a perfect goal to start with. And now let's work on making it more specific and measurable. So when you tell me like "I want to drink water," how much water are you thinking in terms of maybe ounces, bottles? Do you have something that you carry with you that will help you remember to take... to drink water? What are your thoughts about that?

12:20:35 Participant: Yeah, I used to carry a water bottle but not anymore. But I think if I had to say something like very specific I would say, like a start would be maybe three water bottles, like from those that you find like at the store. I have a bunch here at my house. So I think I would start with probably like three days, I mean that's healthy, but I think...

12:21:11 Coach: Yeah. In thinking about where you are today, and where you want to move forward, I would just say don't think about what is recommended or what is healthy, think about what is feasible for you to start with, and gradually add a little bit more, because that's what's going to make you successful. You want to set yourself up to succeed in your goal so I would say if right now, you're not drinking any water, let's say you're drinking one water bottle a day, then adding two more and having three water bottles, that's great progress. It's more than what you had before. Yeah, and we'll work on that. So you're thinking three water bottles a day. And when you say the ones from the store, I think there's different sizes so are you thinking more the 16 ounce one?

12:22:10 Participant: I think so, I can also check. Oh yeah, it's the 16.9 ounces, so you're drinking 3 times 16.9 ounces of water a day.

12:22:43 Coach: And thinking, how will you remind yourself to do this?

12:22:51 Participant: I guess I'll just, kind of, since I work from home I'll have those water bottles like on my desk and just kind of drink them consistently. And maybe I'm thinking like by a certain time today, if I have to drink water I can always put a reminder on my phone to just start drinking more water. I don't know if that would be something...

12:23:21 Coach: Setting a reminder on your phone, I think that's a good idea. Sometimes, I find it really useful to associate it with something else that I do. So for example, if every morning I'm eating something, then maybe have at least part of it in the morning, like when you're eating, either before or after you eat. And let's say around noon, you're also eating something, then have a little bit more either before or after your meal. That could be something else that could help you. The idea of associating it with a meal or snack.

12:24:17 Participant: Yeah, that kind of helps. I think when I decide to drink water during one of my meals I finish the whole thing like that meal.

12:24:28 Coach: So think about things that you are doing that are working. And how can something be added to it to just make it a little bit easier I would say and more comfortable. I also wanted to ask, how many days during the week do you want to be able to do this? What do you think will be feasible to start with?

12:24:51 Participant: I think three days would be good, because I do tend to drink water there without even just kind of actually having it as a goal. But obviously not as much as I hope I did so I think maybe if I can start with three days that would be awesome.

12:25:15 Coach: And what would you say is your confidence level about being able to achieve your goal, on a scale of one that's not confident and 10, very confident?

12:25:29 Participant: I would say probably like a seven.

12:25:41 Coach: That's a great goal to start with. Is there something else that you wanted to include or do you think for this week one goal will be a good start and then next week we can revisit adding something else or improving upon the one that you're making for today?

12:26:02 Participant: Yeah, I think one goal... like I want to do like a bunch of goals, but I think just being realistic with myself that I'm in the process of moving and everything, I think one, you know one goal could be attainable if I really just want to focus on doing and completing those three days.

12:26:24 Coach: I fully agree. I think especially in thinking of everything that you have going on, setting at least one goal is very generous to start with. Any other thoughts you want to share around, for example, what have been your successes in the past when you've tried to work on your health or what have been some of the challenges that you faced?

12:26:59 Participant: Yeah I guess like starting with the positive, like I kind of have set myself before where, you know, I start exercising, and I start eating better. Like I've tried doing meal prep for a while, and this was like maybe four years ago. I do remember that I was like pretty healthy in the way that I would go to the gym very often or just even do some sort of exercising. And then also, just kind of like eating healthier. And that just kind of not only made me look a little healthier but also feel healthier. And I think part of it was that I had kind of some friends to go with and then now with, you know, COVID I kind of totally forgot to do even exercise or do all that. And I've been, you know, just being honest, plateauing, and then kind of just... There's been some positives where I knew what kind of worked for me, and then I felt healthier. And the other part of it that you asked was, what hasn't worked for me, right? I think just liking some sort of food more than I should. Like I love soda, and that's always been like my thing since I was a child. Like I just love Coke. Like I just love Coke and that's one of the worst things that you can drink so every time I go to like a restaurant, I would order like a soda or sometimes if we try not to have soda at the house just because you know I'd be drinking it with every meal, but like when we do have a party or we do end up having soda, I'll always drink that and I'll pick that always over water. So I feel like that has been kind of like an always situation where it's like, "Oh, where is the soda," and then kind of just, I guess kind of going back to, preferring like not healthy choices like if I were to be at a party where there's like salads and then there's like other foods like I'd rather eat the other food versus like eating like salad or, you know, the healthier option. I think that kind of has, you know, I feel, especially with COVID. Now I've just been trying to... I think I feel like I just choose the unhealthy option more than the healthy option.

12:29:47 Coach: Sometimes it's just what's available but also what we are inclined to make certain choices over others, and I think all the things that you mentioned are really related to just the habits that we developed over time, right? If, for example, soda has been something that's been part of your life since you were a child, trying to change that all of a sudden, it's going to take some time. And also the idea that there's healthy foods, and there's also foods that we should have in moderation. That's how I like to think about it so that we don't create this idea of "these foods are like bad for me." They're just not as beneficial for them. Right?Yeah. So, I think you bring up great points about the things that you want to work on. So I'll make some notes so that as we move forward in the next sessions, we could think of, do you want to set a goal around... For example, working on, and I think you're already doing that, drinking more water, which can work to substitute some soda intake, at least for part of the time, right? I want to make sure that you also think about how can you still enjoy the things that you like to eat. But as I mentioned, in moderation, right, because those are the things that either bring you memories or make you happy. And you want to be able to have those in your life as well. Just maybe smaller versions of it.

12:31:38 Participant: Yeah. No, I think that's... Yeah, that's a good way of putting it. I guess like I always kind of try and make myself feel bad like "oh this is not healthy it's not healthy" and I think you're right, it's about moderation, how much you're actually having, portion sizes. A lot of different things that we definitely need to consider.

12:32:05 Coach: So let me ask you a little bit about the messages that you've received so far. So, so far you've been getting daily text messages, I think you should have gotten at least a few by now because today's Tuesday, or you just started getting them on Saturday. That's correct. So, what are your thoughts so far on the messages that you've received? And if you feel that you haven't gotten enough to really evaluate them, no worries, you'll be getting a lot more every single day. And you can always tell me more about them next week too.

12:32:45 Participant: Yeah, yeah I'm not like... I think you know that type of person that I'm like, I will open an app you know like there's sometimes like an app where they give you like daily affirmations or like quotes and things like that but I'm not really like that type of person to open an app, and like read the quote of the day or something. But this makes it easy because it's like a text message that I... you know I read all my text messages so it kind of gives me that ability to just open it up and actually like read it. So that has been helpful. And then like the, you know, just the text message that I would... I think they're good. I think I received like a couple that I really liked. I think it was like a picture like some food in the background and then there was like something written out that I really liked. So yeah, I think I enjoy the text message.

12:33:54 Coach: I was trying to open, where I can see the messages that you receive. And I thought maybe that disconnected... you know, I was just freaking out, trying to figure out the message that you were referring to.

12:34:21 Participant: That was the one that said like "So basically," and then just like, like a fun fact I think. And then it was a message that I got this morning. It was "Saturday is good. Eating healthy, exercising, and being a healthy way can add seven years to your life and you can cut your risk of type two diabetes and heart disease."

12:34:41 Coach: That stood out to you?

12:34:42 Participant: Yeah, I think it's just, you know, for me like more pictures, personally, than the other messages that I've ever seen. But I think, you know, for me, I've always kind of liked pictures a little better.

12:34:58 Coach: That's very good feedback. It'll help us to consider for the future messaging. Do you want to make them all more photo-like or similar to the one that you got on Monday, less text? So, no that's very good. That's good. It helps us to move forward. Any other items that you wanted to check in with me today, or bring up?

12:35:37 Participant: No, I think that's it so far, I think. Yeah.

12:35:42 Coach: So I'll give you a quick summary about what we discussed today, and send it via email. So typically after the end of our session, I'll type up some notes about our session, send you an email with your goal for the week. And I'll add some resources about water. I know there's, for example, if it's difficult to drink plain water, you might be able to add fruit to it. But real fruit, like cut up fruit or some lemon slices or cucumber so I'll try to find some resources so that it can be fun and interactive for you in that way. But I think you've set great goals for the first week, and as I said I'll send you a little summary with your goal, any resources that I can find. And I will be following up with you during the week to see how you're doing with your goal of drinking water. The other part is ideally we want to meet once a week. So I wanted to ask if Tuesdays at noon are a good time for us to meet weekly, or did you want to look at a different time or different day of the week?

12:37:01 Participant: Yeah, let me... Yeah, I think that could work. Tuesdays... Today, we couldn't do through Zoom but it worked out.

12:37:14 Coach: And I will send you a calendar invite for sessions two, three and four. If at any time, the other sessions conflict with anything that comes up, just let me know and we can figure out an alternate day. See, that's all I have for you today. Unless you have any questions for me.

12:37:42 Participant: And I think I guess the text messaging that I get, is it from you or someone else?

12:37:51 Coach: So the text messages are through an automated platform that we created. So our team developed the messages, our research team, and they're automatically being sent to you and to the rest of the people that are participating in the program. However, I do send you individual messages through the platform. So for example today when I said, "Looking forward to meeting you today at noon," that was from me. Sometimes I sign them with my name just so that you know that it is me. But there's a certain number of characters I'm allowed to use. And so, I don't always have room for that. But if you ever respond to messages, I get to see it directly, it comes to me.

12:38:42 Participant: Got it, okay, I just wanted to make sure. It sounds like texting someone.

12:38:47 Coach: No, you're right. If you reply, it comes to me.

12:38:53 Participant: Got it, okay, that's helpful to know. Yeah, I think that was my only question for now.

12:39:03 Coach: So I will see you next Tuesday. And it was a pleasure to meet you.

12:39:09 Participant: Yeah. It was nice meeting you and thank you so much for the call.

12:39:14 Coach: Thank you. Have a great rest of your day.
