10:01:45 Coach: Hi.

10:01:45 Participant: Hi. Sorry I'm running late today. I'm good. I clicked the Google Meet link instead and figured nope that's the zoom link.

10:02:00 Coach: I know there's so many different ways to meet these days that, you know, it could be confusing and you're thinking it's one thing or don't know which platform. So I'm glad you checked sooner than later. So thank you so much for joining me today. My name is Erica, and I'm going to be your health coach for the next four weeks. Before we get started I want to provide you with a quick, just a quick introduction about what the program entails, which I think you have a pretty good idea by now. And then we'll get into our goal setting and setting goals around health and wellness. How does that sound?

10:02:47 Participant: Sounds good.

10:02:49 Coach: So as you might have noticed, EXAMEN is a two part intervention. One part of it is the daily text messages that you have been receiving. And the other part is meeting with me, the health coach. So in my role I will be meeting with you once a week through zoom. And the goal is to meet for at least 20 minutes. If we need a little bit more time than that we can talk about it and work that out. But during that time it's really to focus on checking in with you about your thoughts about the daily messages that you're receiving, but also set goals around health and wellness that you want to work on. I will also be asking you about your stress level, and how your stress is from week to week. So in addition to that, I will follow up with you through a text during the week to see how your goal is coming along and how it's progressing during the week. If at any time there's any questions that I feel might be sort of outside my scope of work or topics that I'm not too sure about, I'll do my best to refer you to someone that can help. That way you get appropriate resources for that. So as you are aware this is a research study. We are collecting quite a bit of information. Our specific conversations will remain confidential and any information is de-identified. So the conversations are not linked to the person. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable sharing. And by the end of the four weeks we do hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, which we'll talk about today, and any other skills that we discuss that you feel empowered to be able to manage your physical, your mental, and your spiritual health. That's really our goal with EXAMEN. So thank you so much for participating and this is really going to help us to figure out if we can actually produce this on a bigger scale for all USF students, so I'm excited for that. Do you have questions before we get started?

10:05:08 Participant: Not yet.

10:05:08 Coach: Yeah and feel free to ask as we're moving along, and be part of this. So I do want to know a little bit more about you and sort of what are you hoping to check in about today. What do you want to focus on for this upcoming week. What are you hoping to get from the session? And that can help us to both be on the same page.

10:05:38 Participant: I think for me, so I'm a clinical psych student so I might throw a lot of psychology terms out there without realizing it, but I'm in like the precontemplation phase of wanting to get healthier, wanting to be better with exercise, eating healthier, all of that jazz. But, and I actually started to do that right before COVID hit. I started going to the gym for two weeks straight and I was like, Yes! And COVID happened and all the gyms shut down and I was like, Well, so I went back to kind of my pattern of just not working out, not eating healthy, just kind of doing whatever I need to do to get through my psychology program without really caring about my health.

10:06:28 Coach: Yeah. And I mean I think right now, it's a bit of a stressful time and stress tends to sort of prevent us from doing a lot of the things that we want to do. So I think it's normal to sort of draw in at times where life is stressful, but we're definitely going to talk about what are some things that we can still continue to do that will keep us motivated and that will push us forward. Maybe we have to do exercise in a different way, if it's not being able to go to the gym. Although I think some of them are open these days, but even then, let's say I don't feel comfortable going, right? So what can I do that's outside of the gym that's still going to keep me active, whether it's physical activity that you want to focus on, or whether it's maybe nutrition or stress management and how do we do those different things.

10:07:27 Coach: I think you bring up a lot of topics that we can focus on. In terms of stress for this last week, if you could rate your stress on a scale of one, not stressed, to 10, very stressed, what would you say was your stress level this last week?

10:07:47 Participant: Um, I think, because I do the clinical work I was doing, like up until today, I was at like an eight, just because I have a lot of high risk clients, and so preparing for them makes me really stressed and I have a couple of new clients that I'm a little worried about. So for me it's just anticipation about working with my clients that gets me really stressed in the beginning of the week, but once I finish all my sessions I'm like alright I'm done, I'm okay, the weekend is coming, and then Monday I'll do it all over again.

10:08:26 Coach: Now, do you have a specific workload of clients or does that kind of vary depending on what things are going on at work?

10:08:34 Participant: It was pretty consistent up until recently. We've got an influx of clients so I had 12, but I think I'm pushing up to like 14 soon, so it's a lot, but luckily I'm only doing that work two days a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays.

10:08:55 Coach: And the other days are you focusing more on classes and all the other aspects of your program?

10:08:55 Participant: Yeah, it's a lot to handle.

10:09:14 Coach: So it's hard to handle it all. Well, let's figure out ways that we can make it all manageable and still find time for you and for that self care that's much needed.

10:09:19 Coach: So I know you mentioned a little bit before about how before COVID, you were doing really well with your goals. You were going to the gym, you were eating healthy. So as of right now, I guess just to get a baseline, how are you doing in meeting your health goals right now on a scale of one to 10?

10:09:39 Participant: I'm probably like a 1.5.

10:09:44 Participant: I don't say one because I do like I'll do probably one exercise a week and I'll eat like one healthy thing a week, so I'll give myself a half a point for that.

10:09:59 Coach: Hey, it's, I think the way that you said it, it's better than zero, right. So it's absolutely fine.

10:10:03 Coach: So in thinking about some of the messages that you received for this last week, were there any messages that stood out to you? Were there any that sort of motivated you to start working on something for this upcoming week?

10:10:20 Participant: Yeah, I think the messages about eating fruits and vegetables, it was kind of like a personal poke at me because that's something I can consistently not do. And I hear it from a lot of people in my life so it felt like that message was kind of like a reminder like this is a big deal. And, you know, not only do the people in your life know it, but people who don't even know you know that you need this. So that's kind of what stood out to me. And then the exercise piece, I mean, I think I get outside at least 30 minutes a day because I do have a dog that I walk, but I don't feel like it's enough because I was an athlete up until college, and once college happened, it was like sports were non existent, exercising was non existent. I just became so immersed in school that all the physical stuff went away. So I feel like when I go out for 30 minutes my body's like girl you need more, like you can handle way more than this, you just don't do it. So I think for me, I just want to get better at being more consistent about the exercise piece, to be more consistent with exercise.

10:11:40 Coach: So the way that we do goal setting is, for example, today is our first session, and we start talking about what are some of the things that you want to focus on. And once we specify that we can start thinking about setting a SMART goal around it. So making a goal that is around health or wellness. But it's specific, it's measurable. We're going to meet today, Thursday. And my goal is, depending on your availability, I'm hoping that if you're available every Thursday. Did I just say Wednesday? Thursday, good day. Yeah, yeah, my goal would be that we could meet every Thursday at this time. If you're available and if that works. That way we can check in on a weekly basis. And we can see how did you do for your last week's goal. So ideally the goal would be from today, Thursday, to next Thursday, so just seven days. Think of it. And you don't have to do it every day, it can be maybe starting with two days, three days, whatever you feel will be most attainable and achievable for you.

10:12:57 Coach: So do you have something in mind for this week? What kind of goal do we want to set?

10:13:07 Participant: I think a goal I keep trying to set for myself is to work out. I want to give myself at least four days a week. And maybe for at least 45 minutes. I want to say an hour but it's like I'm lucky if I get to 30 minutes so maybe 45 minutes would be a good goal.

10:13:23 Coach: And when you say work out, what do you picture in your mind?

10:13:28 Participant: And that's something I'm kind of debating on too. I did just, I finally was able to kind of set up a little gym in my garage so I do have like a weight bench and a bar and all that jazz. But I also want to get good with cardio so I don't know if I should tell myself, or I can split it up like 15 minutes of running followed up by like 30 minutes of doing weightlifting or something.

10:13:58 Coach: Yeah. I think you've got this. This is like all just been sitting inside just kind of marinating but it just doesn't come out. Well, we're going to get you to get it out there. I'm going to get it in writing. I'm going to send you a note about it. So all those steps are purposeful right? They're meant to remind you, okay, I said that I would do this. And then we're going to meet every week and I'm going to ask you about it so then there's accountability.

10:14:22 Participant: Okay, so right. And it's, for me it's like, I have my partner who's always pushing me to exercise but when I see him I'm like no, I only exercised twice, but I know you're not gonna yell at me for it, you're not going to leave me for it. You're just going to be like, slap on the wrist, like you're fine, do it next week. Because I don't know you and because I want to do well with this I think it helps. Like I do feel like I don't want to let you down. Like I want to, I want to stick with this.

10:15:03 Coach: But we also want to make sure that it's something achievable for you, because my goal is to ensure that you succeed. And by doing, and the way to do that is to make sure that any goal that we set is something that you have time to do. You can make time to do it. And that is not going to cause you extra stress or strain in your daily schedule. I often say, think of something that you can include in the things that you already do. So that it's not an extra burden that you have to now carry with you, or worry about too much. But this is something you've been thinking about, you know. So we're thinking of working out and that includes running but also weightlifting, you want to do four days, and see for 45 minutes total. Do you know which days of the week, what time of the day. What are you thinking for them?

10:16:00 Participant: The times I'm still kind of unsure, but the days I was thinking was Tuesday through Friday. Just because on Mondays I'm in person for my clinical work, and so I'm basically going all day. And then by the time I get home, and I don't know, I don't do very well at night so I wouldn't do any of these workouts after like 6pm or maybe after 7pm. So I think, ideally I would want to do it in the mornings. Before I start the day. I think for some reason, like when I wake up I'm kind of like, I'm just going to turn on this TV show and watch this instead, you can like walk over to my garage which is literally a doorway and work out. So I think yeah maybe just pushing for the goal of like seven in the morning or something like that.

10:16:52 Coach: And what is something that you'll do to remind yourself to do it? Because as you mentioned, sometimes we're more inclined to get up and, you know, turn on the TV rather than, you know, go and do my workout. So what is going to be something that you're going to either tell yourself, remind yourself, or visually have something that can help you?

10:17:14 Participant: I have in the past like set myself alarm reminders to do things, and I do have the tendency to just like snooze it and then I'm just not going to do it, but hopefully I can be more consistent with it and really set my alarm and label it as workout. But I think I also picked seven because I know I'm going to be up by six, six thirty, and that does give me a little bit of time to kind of do whatever laziness things I want to do before jumping into my workout.

10:17:49 Coach: Yeah, no, I think that's giving yourself plenty of time in the morning. If you know that if you get up at six thirty that will give you time to still do your workout and sort of relax, so that you don't feel that you're super rushed into it. That's good. And how confident do you feel about being able to achieve this goal on a scale of one, not so confident, to 10, very confident?

10:18:13 Participant: I would say like a six because historically I have not been doing very well, but I'm hoping that being a part of this program is going to just kind of be that one little thing that pushes me to just do it.

10:18:29 Coach: So when someone tells me that their confidence level is a six, it tells me that they're still thinking about it, that they have a feeling that there might be something that could come up. And you brought it up like perfectly. Historically, I know it's something that I want to get started but I'm still not quite sure. So in thinking about your goal, is there something that we can do to increase your confidence level. And what do you think would help?

10:19:03 Participant: That one's hard. I would say like getting a workout buddy would be helpful, but I don't know who that would be. Like it would be easy to say my mom but I have already tried to work out with her and it's really difficult because she's over here like laughing and rolling around and I'm over here like take this seriously. So I don't know, I would want to do it with my mom but I also I don't want the frustration to build and I don't want her to feel like oh I'm attacking her because she's not doing a good job with working out. But I think for me I'm always thinking about how I always played on teams and that's kind of what kept me motivated. But I don't know, like I would ask my brother but he's lazier than I am. But maybe if I work hard enough to persuade him he would be interested in working out with me, I think, but then again I don't want, he's not very helpful. I don't know, I feel like I just have to pick somebody though, in my area who's going to push me as much as I want to push them, but I don't know who that person would be at the moment.

10:20:16 Coach: I'm trying to think, because I want to make sure that you feel very confident about being able to do this. So we're thinking working out 45 minutes, Tuesday through Friday. Having a buddy would help. But you're not sure how to ask at this point.

10:20:38 Participant: Like I also was telling myself, well mentally maybe if you make sure you put on workout clothes when you wake up, like not just shorts and a T shirt, which is my easy like everyday outfit since COVID started. Like if I maybe put on leggings, a sports bra and a workout shirt and like tennis shoes maybe as soon as I woke up. Maybe that'll kind of mentally set me up for okay girl you're already in the outfit, walk over there, because I don't know. I'm just, because I was going through online and I saw these leggings so I was like oh they're so cute, these leggings are so cute. If I had them like maybe I would feel more inspired to work out, but I didn't buy them because I'm like, No, no spending, but it was kind of like maybe I need to dig out the leggings that I don't wear anymore because they're just tight, and I don't want to be in tight clothes all day. But I think that might help me kind of turn on the mentality of like, go workout and then you can get out of these clothes.

10:21:42 Coach: Like when I used to go to the office, I would set up my clothes that I'm going to wear in the morning out. And so I think it reminds me of that, but what you're saying like to put them on first thing in the morning, but also maybe to prep them the night before so that yes they're ready for you to put on first thing in the morning.

10:21:57 Participant: Yeah, I like that idea, kind of just having them there like that. Additionally, if I walk by it it's like calling me, hey Brittany.

10:22:12 Coach: So if you were to do that, let's say you were to get dressed as soon as you get out of bed, put on your gym clothes, how confident would you feel about being able to achieve your goal this upcoming week?

10:22:25 Participant: I would probably be more like an eight.

10:22:27 Coach: Okay. Yeah, sometimes it's the steps before it takes us to actually do the activity that we need to process, right? Because I can't like someone can't just come up to me right now and say you want to work out and I'm like, Oh, I'm not in the right mental space, my body's not in the right space, my clothes, it's just no, I'm not ready.

10:22:55 Coach: Okay, so is there any other goal that you want to work on for this week or do you think this is a very good start?

10:23:06 Participant: I think it's a very good start. I don't want to feel overwhelmed either.

10:23:09 Coach: I think it's a good start. I'm also trying, I want to make it more of a habit to at least eat one fruit and one vegetable a day because seeing that text about seven servings I was like, I'm like that's a lot, like, I don't even get like a seventh of it. So I was thinking if I can at least get at least one serving in a day, then I'm making a step in the right direction.

10:23:34 Coach: Do you want to set that goal for this week or do you want to wait to see how this week goes and then we can work on that for the following week?

10:23:43 Participant: I think we can wait. Maybe I'll kind of like prepare for it like I start eating fruit in general this week, and then I'll set the goal.

10:23:56 Coach: Yeah, it'll make it easier that way too because now you'll know that it is possible. And then it's more about adding variety or increasing the amount. Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine. Any other successes that you've had or any other challenges that you're facing that you want to kind of troubleshoot or problem solve around to get you ready for next week?

10:24:24 Participant: Oh, I mean in general the stress and anxiety that I'm feeling is super high being in my program. I've decreased it, thank goodness, by taking on an extra year. I made that decision this semester, so everyone in my cohort is preparing to propose their dissertation next month. And if that was me I would be really, hair falling out, like it just wouldn't happen. So I gave myself an extra year which has definitely decreased the stress. But I'm in my early phases of preparing my dissertation and that's really anxiety provoking for me because I've never done anything like that. So that's just, I feel like for me it's just the anxiety, it does create a lot of procrastination in my life. And ever since COVID started, I've been in this room, ever since, and I haven't been anywhere else. And so I feel like that has created, I mean I know I've had depression on and off, non-diagnosed, but it's definitely increased that just being in the same space all day. It kind of makes it hard to be motivated to do things. So I think I've definitely reverted into a personality that I haven't experienced before. I'm usually really on top of things, I complete all assignments on time and thoroughly, and lately I have, I forgot to do a presentation, I forgot to turn in a homework assignment and I was just like, this is not me. I've never done these things. So I'm just trying to pull myself back to where I was before COVID started, my productive, highly motivated self that was really driven to get through this program. I think right now I'm definitely experiencing burnout for my clients. So that's kind of like a multi layered thing. So I just kind of wanted to throw that out there. I am a big ball of stress and anxiety, followed by some sprinkled depression. But I think, and that's the main thing that keeps me from really helping myself. So I'm really trying to make sure that I'm not in the way of what I want to achieve. So that's really why I did sign up for this because I was like, I felt like it was for me. I was like oh my gosh like these are exactly the things I'm dealing with. I'm struggling and I don't know who to ask help from. I don't seek out therapy because I'm like the process of finding a therapist is already stressful in and of itself. So for me to want to become a therapist but have trouble finding a therapist is ironic. For me it's like I don't get it. So I just I'm just throwing all that at you. Just so you're aware, but I think this is really going to help.

10:27:23 Coach: That's our hope too. And this program was very, it wasn't intended to be done during a period of COVID. It was intended to actually be done last fall, before it all started. Well I guess it was already going on but the intention was it was actually supposed to be in person. And we had to change everything to be an online format. But I think it's actually worked out really well because we've gotten to reach a lot more students this way. And at the same time we are kind of helping each other as we go through this period of time that's very uncertain. It's changed a lot of the ways that we do things. Like you said, we're not used to being indoors so much. I am a bit of an introvert so I'm always indoors, but I mean I do like to go to certain places, but not being able to maybe see friends as much or just travel or all the things that we take for granted at times. I think it's really made us sort of readjust and reframe the way that we see the world, but that can also affect our just internal mood, our anxiety, as you mentioned, any feelings of depression that we might have had in the past, can actually get a little extra and flare up during this time.

10:28:58 Coach: So it is. I'm glad that you mentioned all of that because it also lets me know that you're very aware of where you are, but you're also very aware of who you are when these situations are not happening. And you know that you can get out of this, and you know there's a process that needs to happen in order for you to get there. So just remember that you're not stuck in this place. Things will hopefully change soon. And we'll work on how to make those changes. Any other questions? No, I don't have any more questions for you. Session one is more, you know, to get a little baseline, set some goals which we have. After today, I'll send you a summary of the goal that you're going to be working on, and we do want to set up upcoming sessions. So let me get my calendar here. Okay. So right now we have Thursdays at 10. Is Thursdays at 10 a good time for the next three weeks or do you want to set up next week and then check in next week about the following?

10:30:26 Participant: Same time every week.

10:30:26 Coach: Okay. Yeah, I mean that works perfectly because then we can just set it up and if anything does come up just let me know. And we can figure out how to work it out. Okay, so I'll send you an updated calendar invite, it'll have a link. So just remember it's Thursdays. And I can also text you right before if you want a little reminder, or I'll just assume that you remember. Okay. And then, any other thoughts? And then I'll send you an email reminder with what we discussed today. And mainly the goal, nothing else like anything private that we discussed. I don't want you to get like this huge email alert. Those are scary. Any questions that you have for me today? Well, perfect. Well, it was very good to meet you, Brittany. Best of luck, you will get there. Do you have ideas for your dissertation yet? Sorry, no pressure.

10:31:33 Participant: I'm actually going to, like blanking but there's a prison program called Positive Change, and they, you know my dog's walking in, they take rescue animals so shelter dogs and they place them with inmates in California and the inmates train those dogs so that they can be adopted. So my dissertation is on understanding the rehabilitative process and the benefits of that program.

10:32:07 Coach: Oh, yeah, it is amazing. And I have never heard of that before, by the way, so you taught me something new today.

10:32:14 Participant: I love dogs so the fact that I can get that into my dissertation was exciting, and I made contact with the program and they're excited to work with me so I was like, holy crap, I care about this.

10:32:27 Coach: Yeah, and I think in terms of when we think of people that are incarcerated, there's some programming. But there's really not a lot of conversations about it, right? What is really happening in our jail system.

10:32:41 Participant: That's right. Yeah, exactly.
