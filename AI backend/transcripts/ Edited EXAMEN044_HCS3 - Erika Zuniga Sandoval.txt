17:58:11 Coach: Start with how was your goal during the week. How did you do?

17:58:16 Participant: Okay. So, sometimes... So okay, my goal was the walking meditation and then maybe that takeout - I think you wanted me to do two days. So far the takeout thing has been going good. Um, yes. And so like for the busy days I've been doing something I can make ahead of time or whatever. It's like yesterday we had this lasagna for dinner because that's something I can make earlier in the day, or just put together really fast. And then, but I have forgotten to do it on the walk and so I'll just do the meditation later that day. So that's been going okay. Um, I just feel like I'm not... like the, I don't know, I don't know how to explain it. Like it's not feeling like it has the same benefit that I wanted to feel from it, I guess. Um, and I don't know if that's just because of like the difference between the walking meditation versus just doing it sitting, or if it's like just trying to fit it in the day rather than having a set time for it. I don't know.

17:59:52 Coach: Did you notice a difference between the walking versus the sitting?

17:59:58 Participant: Yeah, I feel like sitting I felt more refreshed afterwards than I did with the walking. Like the walking was nice in the way that it helps like center myself and like kind of get grounded. But I have noticed this week that I've been having very high stress levels, because I'm not necessarily sure why. I don't know if it's just a combination of this being the last full week of school. Just because like my body's stress response is just to kind of shut down. So like I get really, really tired for no reason, and it doesn't matter how much I sleep, I'm still exhausted. Like on Tuesday, I ended up - I slept a full night, you know, at least like six to seven hours, and I got up and I made myself breakfast and I fell asleep after breakfast on the couch. And then I got up and then I like laid down on my bed and I fell asleep again until like right before class at 11. So it was just... yeah, I just noticed that my stress level is really, really high.

18:01:14 Coach: On a scale of one to 10, what would you say was your stress level this past week?

18:01:23 Participant: Probably an eight or nine. Yeah.

18:01:29 Coach: Yeah. And I think you're very aware of the type of body responses that you have. Because yes, even though you had a full night's sleep, your body was still telling you - your mind might be working like overtime and you just need more rest. I pick that up after, you know, being in school for so long. Just I end up... and I guess that's part of the reason why I really want to learn good coping mechanisms for stress and feeling overwhelmed. Just because I'll tend to like - my body like starts to shut down and I like I get really tired at first and I'll just be really sleepy all the time. Like right now I want to go take a nap. And then after that, if the stress doesn't go down - and I think because stress lowers your immune system - I get sick. Then I'm sick for, you know, a few days, and then it makes me more stressed because I can't afford to be sick because I have stuff I need to do.

18:02:31 Coach: Yeah, it sort of delays everything else that you need to get done. So in terms of that, you're hoping that meditation was going to help you to be able to manage some of that. And you found that it could be that one version versus the other was actually more beneficial. Are you finding that the sitting meditation is requiring too much time and that's why you feel that you're more likely to just fit it in wherever you can? And that's why you don't see a benefit?

18:03:00 Participant: I guess I just don't set the time aside for it consistently. Like I guess I should. Like I tell myself I'll do it after lunch, you know, like I'll meditate after lunch right after - it'll be good because between classes I'll feel refreshed and not have like that afternoon drag. And I'll end up eating lunch, because I prioritize walking Luna, or working out over meditating. So I'll work out and then I'll only have like an hour or so, or 45 minutes before my next class. And so by the time I'm done eating, there's not much time before class and so then I can't really feel like I can relax because I'm just thinking of class being in like 15 minutes, you know?

18:04:06 Coach: Is there a different time of the day that you feel there's more flexibility, where it could be done? Or you want to do it in the afternoon but that's also when you have more activities going on.

18:04:19 Participant: Yeah, I was thinking about maybe trying this week to maybe do it right after classes are done to reset. Yeah, to kind of reset. Those are the only other thing I could try. There's like a few points in the day that I could see myself starting the habit, hopefully, which would be either like right when I wake up, after breakfast, after lunch, or... So I guess breakfast slash when I wake up. After lunch, after classes, or before bed. I tried once this week - it was okay. I haven't done one in the morning yet. And then after lunch I just... it's I don't fit it in. I don't give myself enough time. So really the other ones have been like somewhere in the evening after class, and then or when I walk, or before bed - that one time.

18:05:33 Coach: And of the times that you did do it this last week, because you were able to still do the meditation - I think we're just trying to figure out how do you find a time that it's actually giving you the most benefit that you wanted it to give you. So of the times you were able to do it last week, was there a time that you felt if I could do it more regularly at this time, it would make a difference?

18:05:59 Participant: I want to do it in the afternoon. That would be the best because that's when I get really tired and so I'll get a snack or I'll drink tea or sometimes coffee if I'm really desperate. You know, something to just help like... I tried it today where I meditated after my class. And I had - I'm on the board for the moot court program and so we're interviewing applicants for next year - and so I had 20 minutes between class getting out and the moot court stuff. And so I did just like a 10 minute meditation on YouTube. I actually felt really good afterwards. Like I felt refreshed. I'm tired again now, but it helped at least for a little while.

18:06:50 Participant: So I would like to do it in the afternoon to kind of beat that afternoon, late afternoon to evening drag. So I was thinking like right after classes wouldn't be too bad. Just because I'm also doing kind of a studying goal to kind of help my stress levels as well so I'm not so overwhelmed. Just doing an hour of studying for finals a night and I've started this like earlier this month so I had a whole month before finals so I could just do, you know, an hour, maybe more depending on - maybe two depending on how I'm feeling that day. And that way I'm not putting it off until the last minute. But this past week, specifically from like last Friday, I've been just dragging. And so by the time like I'm going to do my study - because I do it late at night - um, I just I can't even... I don't feel like I'm learning the material or reviewing the material like I want to because I'm just so ready to sleep.

18:07:56 Coach: Yeah, you're tired by that time so being able to concentrate and stay motivated on the subject is a little bit more difficult by then. But it was working up until like last Friday, and so that's what I... that's kind of how I'm like okay, this is... And I mean there's different... Your body's definitely telling you that there's something that's reaching its max, right, and something needs to happen to release some of that. However, just remember that we don't want the meditation to also become a stressor in your life, right, because then you're going to have it piled up a little more. But if you found that the afternoon was the best time, I think it's worth another shot and see how it goes this week. Okay. So how long have you been meditating, or how long do you want to meditate in the afternoon?

18:09:11 Participant: So they have like small goals, like 10 minutes. Yeah, I've been able to find like two minute meditations, five minute meditations on YouTube. So it could be any amount of time that you think okay, I can dedicate this to it.

18:09:23 Coach: I think 10 minutes is like the right amount, because I do - I guess I technically do meditate most days because I do a short meditation after a workout. But it's only like a two to three minute thing and it's just relaxing. But I don't really count that, you know?

18:09:48 Coach: It can be - it can be that. Good piling it up at the end of the day. And so we're saying 10 minutes in the afternoon, how many days this upcoming week?

18:10:01 Participant: Let's try four.

18:10:04 Coach: Five seems too much of an extreme goal. Four days is a very good place to start. Yeah, usually I would say three to four is good. It's a good range. So thank you, you're very good. So you mentioned that you will go on YouTube and find videos. Are there other resources that you use to help you remember to do it, or what are some of the steps that you take to remind yourself to do this?

18:10:39 Participant: Nothing. I haven't, so maybe that's one of the other problems. I haven't done anything to remind myself.

18:10:46 Coach: Is there something that you use every day that can remind you, or set a reminder on your phone?

18:10:46 Participant: I'll set a reminder on my phone. That's why I was kind of like saying things that my day is centered around, like meals or right after class. Like you know that right after class it's time to meditate. So that was the only... that was kind of my way of reminding myself, but maybe an alarm on my phone would be better.

18:11:12 Coach: Yeah. Okay, you can schedule this. Now let's do it. I mean, if you've heard any other suggestions for handling stress, I'm totally open. Aside from journaling - I don't do journaling. I can... No, I think some other ways - there's common ones, definitely like meditation or exercise, which you do. An exercise in moderation should be helping you release stress. Exercise in excess can actually cause stress to your body. So we want to make sure that there's a balance. So continue with the walks. I think the walks are great, the walks will keep you sane. The meditation I think... meditation, we could give it a try. Four days.

18:12:33 Coach: And how confident do you feel about being able to achieve this?

18:12:33 Participant: I'm like a seven.

18:12:45 Coach: And I think when we start... it's something that you started and you're able to do. I think as soon as you start to see more of the benefits of it, it'll keep you motivated to continue. And we also sometimes say that you need to give something at least like a two week trial before you notice somewhat of a difference, or if it's actually something that's helping you.

18:13:14 Coach: When you are doing the meditation, are you doing more guided meditation, just sound, are you doing a body scan?

18:13:14 Participant: Guided, for now. Yeah. I have tried silent or like the sounds in the past, like months ago. And that was fine. I tend to find myself more in the present - I guess because the point of the meditation is to be in the present - and I find myself able to achieve that kind of feeling a lot better when it's guided, because there's something to focus on rather than just being inside my own brain.

18:14:09 Coach: And that guided is... is it about a place that it sends you to, or is it like more of a body scan where it guides you through your body so that you sense where you're having any tension or anything like that?

18:14:09 Participant: I've done those before. Yeah, I don't honestly... I don't even remember what was the one today. I know today was one that was supposed to help with anxiety. It did address some things like releasing some tensions like don't furrow your brow, relax your jaw, that kind of thing. Oh yeah.

18:14:34 Coach: That's a little bit of a body scan. Okay. Just gives me an idea of maybe there's... maybe it also has to do with what is being covered in the guided itself, like the description of it, the script of it can also make a difference.

18:14:56 Participant: I tend to do really well with mantras, I've noticed. Having some kind of mantra to kind of stay inside my head during the meditation because that also, like I said, something to kind of hold on to.

18:15:17 Coach: Okay. I'll look up a few and send you some in this email. I always listen to them just to make sure like is this something that I would do? Which sometimes makes it a little hard because if I don't like their voice... Yeah. Anyone else, let's continue this.
18:15:54 Coach: Okay, so we have one goal - that's a very good one for this week. Anything else that you wanted to talk about this week? Other things that might have come up, any other challenges that you're having? You mentioned that you're realizing the stress is causing you quite a bit of fatigue. But any other things you notice?

18:16:16 Participant: Most... the main one is just fatigue. And I hate it because it happens to me every... like every time I get really stressed out. Because my sister has insomnia, so I'm like I have the opposite problem where I can't stop sleeping.

18:16:31 Coach: And it also seems that because you have been doing well, but eventually when you get to this stress point, it kind of shuts you down. Like okay, hard stop, where he said. Yeah. But you're wanting to learn how to avoid that so that you can just have a smooth transition throughout and manage along the way. Yeah.

18:17:00 Coach: Any successes that you had this last week?

18:17:07 Participant: So I decided to kind of plan out this week's meals, not necessarily meal prepping but just like knowing what I'm going to make so that it's... I know ahead of time and then there's not any kind of like guesswork or just like not having the stuff here so then things kind of get ruined. So that actually helped quite a bit because I was able to get all the groceries for this week, knowing what I was going to be making for dinner. So that actually worked out really well. The only bad thing was is that with the lasagna I had to do that one last minute. I thought I had lasagna noodles and it turned out they expired a year ago. It was like I was opening all these boxes and they had like holes in them because there was like bugs that got in it and like started eating the noodles. And like all of the boxes. I was like oh my god. And the bad thing was - this is because they expired last January and we moved last August, so we moved houses with bad noodles. And little animals in your pantry, and you don't really know at some point. It's disgusting. And then I got new noodles and it worked out just fine. Oh, and then I was proud of myself because I was able to kind of sneak in a vegetable into the dish. Like I put mixed spinach in with the meat, which I'd never done before, and it turned out really good. Like just putting the spinach in there.

18:18:50 Coach: And that's a great way to add a vegetable. Yes, sometimes when you don't even notice it's there. And if you do and it's good, then the better. So you're also trying new things with food. Learning new ways to include fruits and vegetables. I saw your suggestion about the mango with lime.

18:19:18 Participant: And yeah, that's great. I think that's a popular one in my family. I know there's a few fans of it. I haven't tried it and I don't know why. Oh my god, you have to - it's so good. I imagine that it's sweet. Is it sweet or is it spicy?

18:19:34 Coach: Like both. Like the best of both worlds. It's so good. There's a... I was sad because getting that text I was like dang, that sounds so good. And there's this lady... I live in, I don't know if you're familiar with the Northside at all.

18:20:04 Participant: Okay, well there's this one neighborhood in Santa Fe, the Canal District, and that's where I live and it's a largely Latino community. A lot of immigrants live here. So there's always like little... there's always vendors going around. It's like this lady that... oh man. And then there's this lady that always has the mangos with the lime and the tajín and I was like man, I want one of those now. And so I was gonna go get one and I was so sad.

18:20:30 Coach: And we have... I mean I live in San Jose and we have quite a few around, but I don't think I've looked for it specifically. I know there's this area on Eastridge also that sells ice cream and sometimes I go and get ice cream, but I've noticed they sell fruit-related items and I think that's one of the things they put on it. But I always thought that it was more of... I don't know if I thought it was just more like sweet rather than spicy, so I think I stayed away from it for that reason. But I'll try it.

18:21:09 Participant: I used to get it from the paleteros down in San Jose all the time. Okay, I will add it to my list to try. I guess I'll try it. I definitely love lime. It's so good. Maybe there's this little online small business that I ended up buying candy from for my partner for Christmas. And she makes like gummy candy. Like she made... puts like Skittles and lime in other candies. Like Skittles, that's the best one I'm thinking of it. But it was really good. It's really good. I think it was called The Gummy Queen is what it was, and she does other ones too, like the sour dummies. And it's really good. I know it's not that healthy and this is a health coach session, but it's really good.

18:22:08 Coach: One of the things that we talk about sometimes is how do we enjoy the things that we like but we maybe have to switch it up a little bit, right? Or maybe yes, we have them but we have them in smaller quantities, right? We don't have buckets of gummy bears covered in lime. It's delicious. I think especially coming from where we come from and how we grow up and the things that we grew up with, we need to keep that somehow but learn how do we do it in a healthy way, in moderation. And how do we do it in moderation so that it's something that we can continue to enjoy? Because they bring those memories to us and I think those are important aspects to remember about our lives.

18:22:55 Coach: Any other messages that stood out to you this week?

18:22:55 Participant: I'm not... off the top of my head I'd have to look, but I liked that one. I like the one today too. That was cute, the one about the fruit and stuff. I was drinking coffee and it was literally... I was drinking iced coffee as I got the text message. I was like that's funny. I really liked the keeping the fruit cups on hand so you can just take it out of the fridge. I mean I usually keep fruit in the fridge, but just having it already ready to go. I like that just because it's easier.

18:23:39 Participant: I was feeling bitter at last Friday's text because it said sleep has many benefits, and I was like no, I'm really fatigued because like more sleep does not make me feel better. Oh nice, actually. Yes, yes, yes. Oh yeah, but no, overall I like... I like the text messages this week. They were cute. I like the fruit cup idea and I liked today's one too. It's good to text back and say if you freeze grapes, they make cold summer snacks. Yeah, sometimes I do those with the blueberries because they feel... and when they... they make me think that I'm having ice cream but it's a fruit that's just frozen.

18:24:37 Participant: And my dad and I used to do this back before I developed my lactose kind of issue, but if you pour... and I haven't tried it with something else like a milk substitute, but if you put heavy cream on frozen blueberries it turns into like an ice cream fruit kind of a snack and it's lower calorie because you're not using that much milk - it's just a little bit - and it's really, really good. So if you want to... if you're not lactose sensitive, I highly suggest it. It's very creamy and delicious.

18:25:09 Coach: Oh yeah, that sounds really good. I've had frozen fruit with yogurt sometimes and when you do frozen fruit, it turns the yogurt and makes the whole thing... so a little bit like what you just described. It reminded me of that. Yeah, but I have not tried the heavy cream, so that's another option. So that's what he used to do because growing up, my parents were on the Atkins diet for quite some time. So that's what he would do for a dessert because he wouldn't add any sugar or anything to it. It was just the berries, frozen berries, and then he would just pour a little bit of cream on it and it would make like this Berry ice cream kind of thing. It's really... it's very creative and if you think about it, you know exactly what ingredients you're adding to it. There's no additives of any kind or added sugars like you will find in a lot of the ice cream that's processed. So it's a very, very healthier alternative.

18:26:01 Coach: Any other questions that you might have for me today?

18:26:08 Participant: Um, no. Not unless you have any tips on keeping my energy up, other than trying out the meditation stuff.

18:26:19 Coach: I think I would definitely say just look at the things in your day. I mean to me it sounds like you're very good about planning your schedule. You have school and you plan out when you're going to study, but also you plan out some times in between. And I think your body telling you "hey, stop" might be a way of it telling you "hey, I need you to plan out some rest throughout the day so that over time you don't have this extreme exhaustion because there hasn't been enough breaks in between activities or in between assignments that you're doing." And now your brain is just feeling all this exhaustion from it. So something to think about. Maybe that can be the other goal - you have what, 15 minutes to have at least one 15 minute break, five days a week during school, in between classes, not after class, between classes, and doing something that's just for you. Not using those 15 minutes to "now let me do something else that I need to do because I need to be productive," right? Just 15 minutes for you.

18:27:49 Coach: How many days this week did you want to do that?

18:27:49 Participant: Let's do five. Well four, actually, because I only have classes four days a week.

18:28:05 Coach: And how confident do you feel about being able to do that?

18:28:10 Participant: Like an eight. Yeah.

18:28:15 Coach: I think sometimes we forget and it's actually something that we even talk about when someone has, for example, breathing issues or trouble breathing and they want to walk. We really encourage the idea of walk for a minute, stop for a minute, right? So it's a similar idea when you're thinking of your day and all the activities that you want to get done. Yes, you want to get them done as soon as possible, but that's going to exhaust you a lot more. So if you break up your activities and you add some rest time in between, you're going to be able to do a lot more. Yeah.

18:28:57 Coach: And in thinking about that, it will help you not just to do more throughout one day, but throughout the week, throughout the month, and hopefully avoid the episodes that you're experiencing right now where you're feeling so tired.

18:28:57 Participant: I just want to sleep. This is horrible. I hate it. It drives me nuts. When I get a migraine...

18:29:23 Coach: Okay, so I'm coming on. I gotta go take some ibuprofen. Yeah, and definitely do. When it comes to pain, it's a lot easier to stop a little bit of pain than a great deal of pain, right? So take it as soon as you feel the pain because that's actually... it will stop you from taking more medication later over time.

18:29:45 Participant: Yeah, I think so. I think this will be good because now I feel like my body shutting down or getting like the fatigue like I'm saying is just my body's way of saying like you're not stopping for me, so I'm going to make you stop.

18:29:59 Coach: Yes, yes it is. So we have a second goal. Someone's on my door.

18:30:37 Coach: Okay guys. Well, we're almost at the end. And what I will do is I'll send you a summary email with the two goals that you want to work on for this week. Okay. And then we'll check in, or we do need to set up our next meeting.

18:30:58 Participant: Yes. We can just keep Wednesday, that's fine, when things are working.

18:31:04 Coach: Yeah, let's keep it consistent. Okay, so Wednesday at six. Yeah. And that will be... this will not be our last one. I think it will be session four. Okay, so in session four I'll let you know more about what's coming up next. And then we'll go from there. Wow, time flies by.

18:31:28 Participant: Yeah, it's been a month now. Yeah. But I did find it at least so far very helpful, especially like with stuff that... like for instance with like the meditation stuff. Like that's something that I've been wanting to do for a while and I just haven't been able to, and so having someone help me come up with more attainable goals to be able to do it has been very, very good, very helpful. It makes it seem not so big.

18:32:29 Coach: Yeah, yeah. And that's the idea of using those SMART goals, using the attainable, doable goals that you can set up to do on a weekly basis and in a way that works for you, so that it doesn't seem like you said too overwhelming to even start.

18:32:47 Coach: Well, thank you so much Jasmine. I get to see your... your pup back there. I think I see a shadow.

18:33:02 Participant: Luna! Hi Luna. Hi Luna, are you being shy?
