18:18:33 Coach: Hello.

18:18:33 Participant: How are you doing?

18:18:33 Coach: Good, how are you?

18:18:33 Participant: Doing good, too.

18:18:41 Coach: So here's the way I was, um, well, my laptop has been like really slow. Um, but yeah.

18:18:52 Participant: What is the last time you restarted it? I had the same issue this morning.

18:18:57 Coach: I remember like months, I probably should have restarted it soon.

18:19:05 Participant: Yeah, a little bit of like a restart. For me, one of the things that was kind of the issue is that my internet browser needed to update. And so, like, it was just like, I'm not going to function, unless you restart the computer.

18:19:23 Coach: So, no I use Firefox.

18:19:32 Participant: Yeah, I guess I'll just restart it after but because I just have so many windows open that's probably why.

18:19:38 Coach: That's a good one. Yeah, yeah, a lot of space taking up. But, um, how are you, I'm like overall school life health goals wherever you want to start today?

18:19:38 Participant: That's been pretty okay, I've been feeling really tired but I think it's just like the weather it's windy today. Well, at least like where I am. And I'm like, I've been very cold all day. Yeah, I've been pretty productive, the past three days I've been meditating like in the morning for five to ten minutes and like that has been helping a lot. And then I have been like practicing my breathing exercises and like trying to calm down before going into meetings because I tend to get like very nervous and tense before I go into the meetings. But yeah, I also do like a quick five minute yoga, just learning and then some other day. I think it was Monday. Yeah. But, cuz on Sunday I got my vaccine, and so Monday I was like really tired so I didn't do anything.

18:21:14 Coach: Was this your first vaccine or second?

18:21:14 Participant: No, it's my second dose.

18:21:19 Coach: Oh, yeah. What can I ask, if you don't mind, which vaccine you have?

18:21:19 Participant: I have Pfizer.

18:21:28 Coach: Okay, I was. No, you're totally fine it's like afternoon will be day. Oh, all I want is like hot cocoa, like.

18:21:41 Participant: But, um, so how was it. How was it for you this, how was the second dose for you?

18:21:50 Coach: It was like really bad, I think, not so bad. The second one, I don't know what it was, I think it was also like the meditation helped me because I didn't feel a single symptom, like that day I definitely felt it like in the afternoon, like at night. But I also like a drink. Not trying. Well, I had like pills. I'm like, Tylenol I think that definitely helped, but Monday by like Monday afternoon I was perfectly fine, like I didn't feel anything.

18:22:30 Participant: Cool. And then, um, I have the members measure, if this is true for the Pfizer but they for the Moderna like after two weeks you're considered like fully vaccinated. And so you can like see people without masks and all that stuff so you'll be able to also have more social interaction.

18:22:58 Coach: Yeah. And then, I wasn't gonna say. So I guess something to look forward to. The countdown begins.

18:23:09 Participant: I was, was like the biggest thing I've been noticing, even though like students are tired of Zoom is that they're hopeful for the future because like they'll be able to go back in person. Get the vaccine so that has definitely been helping. I think a lot, like myself, especially and like a lot of my classmates as well. Um, but yeah, just a little bit stressed because I'm not sure where I'm going to live next semester. Either on campus or off campus and then I'm also like looking into studying abroad. And so that like is a long process so like going through that, which is kind of draining.

18:23:54 Coach: Yeah. Where are you considering studying abroad for?

18:23:54 Participant: I'm considering going to Spain, to Salamanca.

18:23:58 Coach: Oh, wonderful, I've never been but I've heard really great things and like good food.

18:24:07 Participant: Hopefully I do get accepted, I'll be notified like tomorrow I think.

18:24:07 Coach: Oh my goodness. Yeah, does this impact your leadership position, if you get selected or if you are voted?

18:24:07 Participant: No because the position is only for one semester. I plan to study abroad next year spring.

18:24:31 Coach: Oh cool. So fingers crossed. Let me know if you want to, I will cheer you on. Okay, so it sounds like a lot of good things are happening. One of the kind of like standardized questions I usually ask is around stress level. And so, on a scale of one to ten, what's your stress level been like this week?

18:25:05 Participant: It definitely went down. Also because I'm like tired, it could be the meditation too, I don't know. I would say a six.

18:25:41 Coach: Um, so, there's a couple of ways we can like move forward, one is going to check in about like the text messages or leaning towards starting the next health goal, which do you want to hit first?

18:25:59 Participant: Text messages which is fine.

18:26:01 Coach: Um, so, what messages stood out to you, which messages are you enjoying and have any of them motivated you towards anything?

18:26:17 Participant: I think definitely the ones that I can relate to just because I did grow up in Mexico. And so just like seeing familiar pictures and like words that I heard growing up kind of like it just, it definitely brings a big smile to my face and it like calms me down. Like the "la paz" or "Buddha," or like, that's when they broke down. Yeah, and then like the "cuídate" también. And then that was, that was very nice. I'm glad that that had a positive impact on you.

18:27:16 Coach: How long did you grow up in Mexico for?

18:27:16 Participant: Well, I didn't grow up like I live near the border and like both my parents work in the corner. I'm not sure. Yeah, it looks right at the border. So, they still work there and so we cross like every single day. Because we live in San Diego but like Tijuana is like across the border on the other side. Um, but yeah so also like my grandma lives there, like all my family lives there like we're the only ones to live here. Um, and yeah I went to Mexico like last Friday, I go weekly.

18:28:03 Coach: That is really awesome so right now you're living at home with like your parents?

18:28:10 Participant: Yes.

18:28:10 Coach: So cool I'm so jealous of such good food.

18:28:19 Participant: I know, honestly, I honestly love it. But I'm also grateful that I live here because I just like love my home and I love my friends and stuff so cool.

18:28:30 Coach: Um, so I did know this stuff about like the fruits and like the words and, like they bring a smile to your face. Was there anything else you wanted to add about the messages?

18:28:46 Participant: I like the consistency. It's not like I think it's a good amount. Definitely like engaging. "Examine, consigo ser" nice that's cool. Thank you.

18:29:12 Coach: I forgot who spoke on that. I'll just say advice. Um, so, I'm transitioning towards your health goals of this week. How do you think you did in meeting your health goals on a scale of one to ten?

18:29:37 Participant: I'm gonna say an eight just because I didn't really move that much. I did move but like very limited and slow, but I mainly focused, or like what I mainly did was I meditated. And so, I don't usually do that very often so that was nice.

18:29:57 Coach: So there was like an increase in the meditation that you did. Um, what helped you achieve your health goals?

18:30:08 Participant: I guess just like this program it's helped me, definitely help me like stay motivated. And I feel like these meetings are kind of like an incentive.

18:30:29 Coach: Um, and then do you think, is there anything that you've done to help yourself and meet your goals?

18:30:42 Participant: I mean, I feel like overall I'm just helping myself by like practicing self care and prioritizing myself and putting myself first because I feel like growing up, I wasn't taught that it was always like help others first and then help yourself, you know. Focusing on yourself. Yeah, I just like I'm doing a lot of like inner child work as well. So, yeah, I mean it's definitely taking time and like patience but that seems like a very like psychological term, like inner child, but it sounds fascinating.

18:31:48 Coach: So, um, for this week. Where do you want your goals to lead you? Um, there's been like some messages around physical health, mental health, spirituality, emotional health, what is feeling really, like most important and relevant to you?

18:32:23 Participant: I think one of my goals is to treat myself once a week, like that mean like going out and buying myself. Or like going out and buying myself like coffee. I would like to do that once a week.

18:32:36 Coach: Is that something that you do now, can be easily done? I'll just say, okay, so in the next week you will go out and buy yourself boba or a coffee, so...

18:33:09 Participant: I was just listening to a podcast, because I also could yesterday like. It was a good day I like woke up, and then I meditated, and then I made my bed early happens. And then I listened to a podcast and the girl was like, every time I work out. I don't like to set a date and time, I just do it whenever it feels natural. She's like, because if I, because if I set a date or time it feels forced. So I kind of like that and I think I would like to follow that because I feel like when I say, oh, I'm going to go for a run, I got this day and time like it just feels forced and then I like have to drag myself to do it. So, yeah, I definitely want to try that. And then I was actually thinking of enrolling in a gym soon. Coach, I don't know, I never got any of those I don't know what to do. Um, but I want to start after finals like I don't want to get into shape but I just want to like feel better like physically. And that's like go at all right like having a private coach, or personal trainer, that's what they're called. Like, is a tool that you can use to help you achieve your goal. So, that's like a long term goal because, well, partly because of the time you're wanting to do it after finals.

18:34:50 Coach:No, no, that's okay I take notes so we can circle back. That's what worked for her. And then that's just another strategy that people use to achieve their goals. So, definitely. There's different ways of thinking about it. And I encourage you to try that way too, to see what works for you. So it's, I don't know if, if you wanted to include that as a goal, like, have that be goal number two. Or you were just like, this is an idea and I want to try it.

18:35:58 Participant: I guess I want to try it as well.

18:36:04 Coach: As like your second goal. So in the next week you will, and then how do you want to phrase the sentence?

18:36:31 Participant: I guess like do a workout for 20 minutes. Once whenever my body feels called to it.

18:37:04 Coach: So, what are signs that you notice, like what signs, I don't know how to phrase this like your when your body is called to it. How do you know when your body will be called, like, what does that signal that your body's going to give you to say like, time to work out?

18:37:51 Participant: I'm really bad but like, when I feel really gross. Like when I feel like I'm not healthy. When I feel very like bloated I'm like okay it's time to work out. Like that also has to do with like, not wanting to gain weight, because apparently when you lose weight like I feel like it also is rooted in there like mindsets and perspectives. But I feel like now, I can work out whenever I just want to feel better like mentally. So I think if I could like rephrase it just a little bit to see if I understood correctly, like, initially it like these cues are rooted in some like body image, maybe like negative body image type of perspectives. So like feeling bloated, not wanting to gain weight and like rooted in something like parental perspectives. Yes, like 50% yes, but like the other 50% is like I physically feel gross, like I don't like, I think it's also after I've been eating a lot of junk food. And it makes me feel tired and like not energized, that's, yeah, that's it. So I guess like, I want to work out whenever I want to feel energy and like the adrenaline.

18:40:25 Coach: So, I didn't mean to like add meaning to something, but it stood out to me because there was like some hesitation and like, oh, I don't want to like have a present in this way and it's totally okay I saw like you wanting to shift it in like more of like a body positive perspective and I think you did that by saying you want to, like, when you're feeling tired or fatigued, it like affects you physically, like in a lot of ways. So that's going to be like the sign that you look for, and knowing that when you do that workout you're going to feel energized feel that like rush of adrenaline and then feel better mentally. Does that sound more accurate?

18:41:19 Participant: Yeah, that sounds great.

18:41:22 Coach: So you have two goals. I'm going to circle back to the first one, just so that we can assess for competence and relevancy. So, the first goal you said in the next week you will go out and buy yourself boba or a coffee once a week. It's specific it's measurable, you're going once a week, buying a boba. It's attainable in the fact that you have money to buy boba. And then, why is it important to you, like what's the relevance of this?

18:42:10 Participant: I feel like it's a treat to myself. And it's a treat to like all my hard work of me, even though sometimes I feel like I'm not productive right you like. I go to all my classes I don't miss any classes so I feel like that in itself like should deserve any treat.

18:42:40 Coach: So, I think, I'm to that point specifically like you know you are showing up as your best self. Every day you like mood and things change but you always do present yourself in the best way. So, um, so in the next week you will go out and buy yourself a boba or a coffee once this week as a way to treat yourself and all your hard work. Um, do you want to specify a date or a time or you're just going to pick it?

18:43:06 Participant: I'll just pick it.

18:43:14 Coach: And then, on a scale of one to ten what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

18:43:23 Participant: Ten.

18:43:26 Coach: Um, let's see. Do you need any support in meeting your goal? This one specifically. And then your second SMART goal. Oh my goodness. Oh, there it is. I thought I'd like disappeared I was like what happened to it. So, in the next week you will do a 20 minute workout, when your body is called to do it. So let me just make sure, is it specific? Yes, measurable, 20 minutes, attainable, you have like the YouTube videos I assume.

18:44:25 Participant: Yeah.

18:44:25 Coach: And then, you did kind of mention this already but just maybe in your words like the relevance to it.

18:44:42 Participant: I guess like after a workout I feel a lot better. Like mentally. And I feel like I'm a lot more awake. And it just makes me, it helps me make, wait sorry, helps me make me feel more productive.

18:45:09 Coach: Um, so in the next week you will do a 20 minute workout when your body is called to do it. And this is important to you because you know it'll help you feel better mentally and more awake and feel more productive. So, on a scale of one to ten what is your confidence level in meeting that SMART goal?

18:45:36 Participant: I'll say a nine.

18:45:49 Coach: Yeah, it sounds like you said really good health goals for the week. 

18:45:53 Participant: Can I add like one more? I want to read once a week.

18:45:58 Coach: So, I think we need to make it measurable in some way. You can do it a couple ways like you will read one article or you would read one chapter, or you would read for like 30 minutes. What's a way to make it measurable that's good for you?

18:46:33 Participant: I mean, I just wanted to read like for myself. Like for pleasure not like for school. So I guess we can do like 20 minutes. Once a week at night.

18:47:03 Coach: Um, do you have an idea of what you want to read?

18:47:13 Participant: I just want to read like a fun book, like a funny book, or just like any book that helps me escape reality of the world.

18:47:48 Coach: Let's see what like do you have any books or do you feel comfortable. I'm like, identifying something or do you see that being a challenge?

18:48:04 Participant: I do have like a whole stack of books.

18:48:04 Coach: Oh, okay. It's totally attainable. So let's see in the next week you will read for at least 20 minutes. I didn't know how to incorporate this but for pleasure. Once this week at night. And I guess maybe that's the relevant piece is like why is it important, is just to like for pleasure. Anything else you want to add to that statement?

18:48:37 Participant: Also like for the reading. I've definitely noticed that reading for pleasure, like calms my mind and helps me, like, not super like just be at peace. It's comforting.

18:48:57 Coach: What kind of books do you read for pleasure?

18:49:16 Participant: I've been reading this one, um. Yeah, but then also I got into like fantasy books but like I also like memoirs. And then this book called like "Everything Everything." Kind of like coming of age like teenage novels. Oh, that's a little drama-ish.

18:49:51 Coach: I'm so just throwing this out there, it's something that I do for like, my own practice. There's comic books that I read on like the Kindle, and they're really quick and easy books and like they're funny, they're like entertaining. And so, I know you have access to materials but they all seem very like thought provoking. And you were looking for a fun or a funny book. So if you're looking for something like more leisurely, I would suggest the comic book. The one that I read is called Fables, and it's like a whole series. I haven't even gotten to like the 15th comic book but it's really good. It's like about like fairy tale characters that live in like the real world, and they have to like keep their identities a secret.

18:50:57 Participant: I don't really like to read books on the Kindle, just because I'm on the screen like the whole day. So that's why I prefer like I'm super traditional like in hand like flipping pages like getting the sense of like touching a book and smelling a book as well. It just brings me back to like my childhood, a lot. I miss physical books, but it's. I'm trying to move away from them, and so, but that's going to be okay. Technology is like, no more paper books on the Kindle it's like, no, no, I think, for me, I know this is kind of like, totally side tracking us but I felt kind of like a hoarder. And I was like, I don't know how to let go of a book, once I've like adopted it into my library, and so like if I buy it electronically, like I'm, I have less stuff around me, because every year, when I was in college as a student, I would have to like pack up my books, move out of the dorm rooms and then it just like just so that's more my perspective of it.

18:52:29 Coach: Um, okay so the three goals, the last goal, I just want to check in about your confidence level in reading for 20 minutes.

18:52:44 Participant: A nine.

18:52:44 Coach: Um, so I will email you these, and if you need any support. Let me know. Were the Google invites helpful to Google invites?

18:52:53 Participant: Yes, yes.

18:53:04 Coach: But if you're needing any other support, let me know.

18:53:06 Participant: Okay, I guess, like the reminders and then like, check ins maybe like Friday, and then Monday as well.

18:53:15 Coach: Okay, let me put that down. So, I'll check in with you this Friday and then again after the weekend.

18:53:27 Participant: Yeah, that's okay. That sounds good.

18:53:27 Coach: I will make sure to do that. Any other questions before we sign off? Our next meeting is the 28th.

18:53:51 Coach: Um, so I have it. I'm the 28th at 6:15pm, can you believe it, it's going to be our fourth coaching session.

18:54:09 Participant: I know, can we do it at 7pm, is that fine?

18:54:13 Coach: That should be fine. Yes, let me go ahead and change that right now. Yeah, I have a meeting from five to seven, I didn't go because I was like really tired and I have to go today we actually perfect, but I might have to go next week so yeah yeah so let me move that down. And then I'll send that to you.

18:54:38 Participant: Cool. So I bumped it down to seven o'clock.

18:54:38 Coach: Perfect.
