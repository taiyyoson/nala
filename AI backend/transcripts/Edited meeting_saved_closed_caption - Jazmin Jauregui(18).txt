14:31:48 Coach: Hello.

14:31:48 Participant: How are you?

14:31:48 Coach: Good. Thanks for meeting me today.

14:31:53 Participant: Yeah, thanks for working all the back and forth stuff. I totally forgot to put something on my calendar and, and I later realized after I told you my availability so I'm sorry.

14:32:09 Coach: Oh, it's okay. I was like, dude I forgot to tell you that they scheduled me for work.

14:32:14 Participant: You have insane hours. Oh remind me again where you work?

14:32:22 Coach: Yeah I work in probation.

14:32:22 Participant: Oh, maybe you didn't mention that before.

14:32:24 Coach: No, no, I don't remember. I think probation would have like stuck out you know? Yeah I work in probation so I mean obviously their work hours are 24/7. So, my work hours basically can be 24/7. I get random hours so no like oh man I forgot to tell you that. Yeah, they had scheduled me, I know this was a meeting earlier.

14:33:05 Participant: No worries. Um, I'm glad we were able to still meet today to check in about your health goals. Um, I want to just let you know that I do have another meeting at three o'clock so I can't, if I usually have like time afterwards, but I don't.

14:33:18 Coach: That's fine. Okay, worked out for me too. So, um, I think I met them all so I had to change a few days around. But I only went to the gym three times instead of four. But I stayed active, I walked on my lunch breaks, and then one of the days I didn't go because I just decided to spend that day like cleaning and doing laundry late, so it's like you know what I need to do this. So that was the reason why I decided to make the decision not to go on, I believe it was Monday the day that I told you that I was like gonna go.

14:34:05 Participant: Okay, but overall it was good. I think you did a really good job of like evaluating like what your needs were at that time, and it sounded like going to the gym would meet a need, but not the priority need. So yeah, being flexible is totally fine. Um, I do have a question regarding like on a scale question. On a scale of one to ten, how do you think you did in meeting your goal?

14:34:33 Coach: So for being the first week, I think that was like an eight. I mean I really wanted to go that fourth day but I was like, I'm going to be up really late if I go and not get that much sleep so I decided to just do the chores and stuff.

14:34:53 Participant: Yeah. So this week are you going to try to be in and make it to the four days, and I guess just like time manage a little bit better?

14:35:07 Coach: This week I'm going to try to just because I didn't make it last week so I'm going to try to push myself and at least go four days. I don't have any specific days right now. I'm looking at possibly Friday, Saturday, and maybe Monday and Tuesday of next week but I might end up going tomorrow Friday and Saturday and then do like a Monday or Tuesday.

14:35:56 Participant: Okay. I'll put in four.

14:36:00 Coach: For sure Friday and Saturday.

14:36:04 Participant: And then the last two are going to be a little bit flexible. Just in terms of like, I think next week is my last week of like actual classes. So I had to get on board on doing like this presentation and all that for school. So maybe just focusing on one health goal for this week.

14:36:24 Coach: And then did we do two health goals last time? I'm sorry I don't remember.

14:36:24 Participant: No, we just did the one which was going to the gym because that would help me with my sleeping.

14:36:39 Coach: Winter did like I've actually been sleeping good.

14:36:45 Participant: Oh, that's good. I haven't had any trouble sleeping I'm getting at least like eight to nine hours a night, and I'm trying to like prioritize that as well.

14:37:07 Coach: Did we set the goal to be 30 minutes at the gym?

14:37:13 Participant: I think yeah I think we said at least 30 minutes of something physical. Because I said I could even do it like something on my lunch breaks, which is what I've been doing so like one of the days I didn't go to the gym but I made sure that I walked on my lunch break for 30 minutes.

14:37:38 Coach: So, just so that we can get some of the practice in terms of creating the SMART goal. Um, how would you phrase the SMART goal so specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely?

14:38:00 Participant: I think like the one that we said at least doing the 30 minutes of something physical like getting your heart rate up. So, either walking or going to the gym. Because I always do even when I do go to the gym I'll do 30 minutes of the elliptical. And then I'll do like other stuff like weights and other things like jumping jacks, but I'll do like 30 straight minutes of elliptical so I get that in.

14:38:39 Coach: So, in the next week you will be physically active for at least 30 minutes, three to four days of the week, specifically Friday, Saturday, Monday and or Tuesday.

14:38:57 Participant: Sure, Friday, Saturday, and then my last two days I'm gonna have to be a little bit flexible on that because I don't have next week's schedule yet for work. And tomorrow I have class so just depends on if class ends early enough for me to make it to the gym.

14:39:25 Coach: And then, I guess to the point about making it relevant. If you do maybe find like a new reason or purpose as to why this goal is important to you? 

14:39:41 Participant: For sure for like the stress reduction, and then the sleeping, as well. So, a healthy sleep schedule like a sleep pattern it like gives me a kind of routine, where I kind of know what I have to do throughout the day to meet that goal. And just to reduce stress and anxiety. I need it right now.

14:40:10 Coach: That end of the semester, like, oh, yeah, definitely, time is critical, and also making sure you take care of yourself. And, you know, work all your priorities, all of that. So, for that your confidence level in meeting your goal. On a scale of one to ten, what would you say that the number would be?

14:40:50 Participant: I would say a six just because those two days of flexibility and not having my work schedule so with my luck they'll probably schedule me Monday and Tuesday. And then I won't be able to go, but yeah six.

14:41:15 Coach: So, out of curiosity. Since the week does start today. Like you were today so maybe not today but what about tomorrow like if you can do tomorrow Friday and Saturday, or you can include Sunday. I know I don't know your schedule but I definitely want you to feel more confident.

14:41:48 Participant: Essentially, I know tomorrow I possibly can, depends on school, like I said, I work during the day so I work from seven to four tomorrow and then class starts at five. And it normally ends around eight, sometimes it goes until nine, and the gym closes at ten so by time I like change and get ready I might be able to squeeze that 30 minutes in if there's no line outside. So I'm going to aim for tomorrow hopefully class ends early, but for sure Friday and Saturday I have those days blocked out to go. Sunday I have an event to go to so that I mean I may be able to squeeze one in the morning. But it complicates things a little bit. Yeah, it's just like I didn't realize like how fast the days are going.

14:42:36 Coach: Okay, so how about you get three days this week, or it sounds like Friday and Saturday, are really the days that you can promise to this goal. And so I mean, like I'm actually looking forward to those days.

14:42:56 Participant: Yeah, just tomorrow depends on class. And then Sunday. I mean, I can squeeze it in, but I have an event to go to.

14:43:08 Coach: So, I'm thinking of a couple alternatives. One is that we can phrase the health goal to say at least two times in the next week. That way it for sure gets met, and then anything above that would be a plus. The other thing that I'm thinking about is if you do Friday and Saturday, you can say, I will be physically active for at least 45 minutes so bumping up the time that you're going to be physically active. And then just say like on Friday and Saturday. Or we can do some kind of combination of that.

14:43:51 Participant: I like that because if I do 45 minutes it'll make up for the third day cuz I'll be adding extra 15 minutes on each day. Okay, let's do that then okay for Friday and Saturday at least 45 minutes of cardio, and that will be my goal for this upcoming week.

14:44:21 Coach: Sorry, I missed what you had said, I froze.

14:44:26 Participant: Oh, I said, we'll do the 45 minutes Friday and Saturday guaranteed. And then anything extra would just be a bonus. So that will be my health goal for this week to do at least 45 minutes of cardio.

14:44:46 Coach: On Friday and Saturday.

14:45:00 Participant: Yeah, now it's like a nine. Because I already have my schedule blocked off so like something tragic would have to happen for me not to reach that so we don't want that to happen.

14:45:21 Coach: Yes. And it's 45 minutes so whole hour, and maybe a half including drive time. Um, so I'm gonna backtrack a little bit because we're only setting one health goal and I have a couple like standard questions. One was about your stress level this week. On a scale of one to ten, what's your stress been like this week?

14:45:52 Participant: It was a good week so I would say like a three.

14:45:54 Coach: Cool. That's really good.

14:45:54 Participant: Yeah, I just like knowing that I had these goals in the back of my mind made me prioritize my time really well, and then making that decision to maybe not meet my goal in terms of going the fourth day but getting like what I had to get done like cleaning, organizing, laundry, all the chores that I needed to get done. Yeah, this was a good week.

14:46:32 Coach: Um the other big question that I had for you was around the text messages. What messages did you like, which one stood out to you, and did any of them motivate you?

14:47:06 Participant: I like the picture ones a lot, just because I'm a visual person so the pictures make it really nice. The fruit and veggies one, that one was nice. It reminded me like okay I haven't got any fruit today. I don't know I like like the little fact like the fun fact ones. I said "protect your heart, keep you got a healthy weight." And the pictures. So when you sent today of like get up and do something active I'm like okay I'm going to do that later on my break. You had a little exercise girl today.

14:47:57 Coach: Any other comments about the text messages?

14:48:06 Participant: No, I like the fun fact ones so those are like my favorite. If I can get more of those.

14:48:09 Coach: They're good. It's a mixed kind of schedule today, or this week the focus was on like tips and ideas like motivate you, and then the next week is going to be more oriented towards like overcoming barriers or challenges. So like, really being mindful of like you can do this. It's going to be okay. But at the end of the intervention, like, after we're done meeting, you will be interviewed by like the principal investigator. I think that would be really good feedback to provide saying like more fun fact ones. A lot of people were like, I wish there were like two messages like oh no we didn't make enough messages, but hopefully like I guess more messages throughout the day instead of just the mornings.

14:49:12 Participant: Yeah, I feel like a night one would be nice. Like an end of day one.

14:49:17 Coach: Yeah, I'd like that. I wish I would have made more. Well, um, I will send you an email with your new health goal. And I think you're gonna rock it like Friday and Saturday 45 minutes of cardio, like you totally got this, and I know next week will be heavy because of school. So I think, you know, you did a good job making it obtainable.

14:49:52 Participant: Yes, thanks for helping me with that because yeah four days might have been a little overreaching, but I was kind of bummed that I didn't make it this week but I feel good I still feel better like my stress is down I slept well, my anxiety's like down. It's just trying to finish this last week of classes.

14:50:18 Coach: Well I think you, you got it and if you need anything or, please feel free to reach out. I'm available through text. Sorry, it takes me a little bit of time to like circle back to text but I will get back to you.

14:50:26 Participant: Okay I get it, we're all busy.

14:50:35 Coach: Okay, well thank you and have a good day.

14:50:35 Participant: Thanks Jasmine. See you next week. Oh wait, we didn't schedule. Did we not?

14:50:35 Coach: No, I don't think so I think we were going to do it week by week because you didn't know your schedule.

14:50:35 Participant: I can do the 28th. If you have anything around noon. I have an appointment at seven. So if you have anything like before six, if possible. If not, I could also do during the day like how we did right now.

14:51:18 Coach: Yeah, my only concern is that I have like my normal work. I'm sorry this is like my internship. So, let me think, I'm, or Thursday, Thursday I have 7:15pm.

14:51:40 Participant: I have class. Oh, what time is your class over?

14:51:40 Coach: Normally like 8:30-ish.

14:51:48 Participant: And I think by that point we're just like exhausted after my classes are on Tuesday and I don't. Yeah, Tuesday's okay. So Tuesday.

14:51:59 Coach: Okay, would like exactly at five o'clock work next Wednesday?

14:52:06 Participant: Yeah, the 28th. Yep, that works.

14:52:06 Coach: Okay, I'll send you another invite for then.
