17:57:47 Coach: Hello. How are you today.

17:57:52 Participant: Busy

17:57:55 Coach: It's getting to that time, I remember you mentioned you're in law school do you guys have midterms to or finals?

17:57:55 Participant: Oh finals yeah finals for sure, we have literally two weeks of classes left.

17:58:10 Coach: Oh, you guys are done before us and our finals are two weeks so I don't know if you guys have finals in the first and second week of May. So how was your week and how was your goal. How did it go?

17:58:43 Participant: Highly recommend adding blueberries to peanut butter oatmeal its top notch. So good. I bought a big bag of frozen blueberries because that's cheaper. And it worked out fine. I tried it with a couple different things like I used dragon fruit one morning and it was fun because it made my oatmeal pink. Um, it wasn't very good like I didn't know dragon fruit really doesn't have that strong flavor you know so it wasn't really that good an oatmeal. And then I went and bought a bag of frozen blueberries from Target and I'm just really good with blueberries, and I still put my peanut butter in there so it's super tasty.

17:59:13 Coach: I've always wondered what the combination of those two would be like because I know that strawberries go really well together. I have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, like with the strawberry stuff and that seems to go well with blueberries, it is like so good like I'm like I'm hyping it up but it's really like so delicious with blueberries in it. I used to really love getting these smoothie bowls, and it's like that, because the one that I would get was like the peanut and has peanut butter in it as well so it kind of tastes like a pb and j sandwich but I'd highly recommend you to try it.

18:00:02 Participant: I will try it because I have a big bag of frozen blueberries that I've been trying to figure out what to do with. So I think that's my next thing for this week, but you have to put peanut butter in it because it's not as good if you don't put the peanut butter. Every morning when I make oatmeal, I put peanut butter in there, but I usually add like a spoon of like strawberry jam to give it a different flavor, or a little something else but I like the idea of putting real fruit in it.

18:00:18 Coach: Good to hear it, I get this Skippy naturals peanut butter with honey. I don't know why but it's so much better but I think its because it is naturally sweetened with honey.

18:00:33 Participant: I make my oatmeal with a scoop of like the zero calorie natural sweeteners like the stevia. And then I do the blueberries in it, and it's super good, good, good. 

18:00:54 Coach: Well I'm glad that worked out. Where would you rate yourself on meeting your goal this week. Where would you rate yourself.

18:00:56 Participant: Oh, right. Yeah. Seven.

18:00:59 Coach: Good, good, good. I'm glad that it worked out, that's always good to hear. And let's see what else are you hoping to check in about today.

18:01:10 Participant: Um, well I did add in a serving of vegetables as well at lunch time. Um, I have been doing just vegetables and then dipping them in just some dressing . Baby carrots and broccoli. Some days. So, I've been doing that. Dinner hasn't been super good. I've been eating a lot of takeout. No I know I need to work on not eating so much takeout all the time, but it's just so convenient. You know, and it's not like it's the quote unquote good takeout where you can afford like the expensive stuff. I know they're not good for you every single night.

18:02:08 Coach: Good for you, it's great that you acknowledge it. I mean everything in moderation is fine.

18:02:25 Participant:  Yeah, I think the way that you're describing is that yes, it was every night so maybe some days but not every day. They're delicious stuff.

18:02:28 Coach: So are you thinking maybe for this week, thinking about a plan that revolves around dinner planning or making different choices for dinner or what are you thinking for your goal for this upcoming week.

18:02:41 Participant: So I was thinking about two different things. Because I know that I just want to like address stress management. Um, so I didn't know if I wanted to try and do already did something nutritional, maybe do something with stress related, this week.

18:03:01 Coach: I think whichever you choose will be great. It's totally up to you. And we just want to make sure that it's something that's specific and measurable like we did for the fruit in the mornings. It was something that you were able to measure and no yes this happened. So what are you thinking for stress management, what would be a specific activity that you can do that can help.

18:03:26 Participant: I was really nervous about this goal because I was very confident with the adding fruit to breakfast, that was easy for me, but this one I know is going to be harder for me. I mean incorporating five minutes of meditation, a day could be good.

18:03:43 Coach: I was going to ask. What have you done before that has worked, or, something that you've been interested in trying.

18:03:57 Participant:  Meditation is something I'm interested in trying which is why I kind of was leaning towards that other stuff that I've done for stress management like just going for walks, I go for a lot of works all the time I also have a dog so that makes it easy.

18:04:10 Coach: Do you usually listen to music or you don't listen to anything cuz you're walking the dog. 

18:04:30 Participant: I called people, I call my mom. Usually, if I like it because I'm alone, a lot with this remote stuff and my partner works a lot so I'm alone home alone a lot and so it's like my. It's nice to have company when I'm walking around to not feel so alone so I'll call I'll call my mom and my grandma my sister call everybody, I'm or I'll listen to podcasts.

18:04:45 Coach: Well, the reason why I'm asking is, because there's such thing as walking meditation. 

18:05:00 Participant: I've heard of that. Yeah. 

18:05:14 Coach: And I'm wondering if you could incorporate it to something that you already do, even if it's just for five minutes of your walk. Hmm. And that way, it's already associated with something that you do and you don't feel that it's an extra thing you have to add to your day. What are your thoughts about idea at all. And I can find a few maybe like five minute walk and meditations things for you, but feel free to also look up to see if you find some that you mentioned podcast. I wonder there's like a podcast about walking meditation.

18:05:33 Participant: I don't know I'd have to look there's one for meditate daily meditation so that was one that I was looking at. I have done, walking meditations a couple times I was subscribing to the Fitbit premium for like a second, and they had a bunch of meditation stuff I switched over to Apple. They don't have an equivalent for meditation. Some of the things I'm thinking of is, I've been able to find like on YouTube I've been able to find walking meditations that are maybe like 5-10 minutes I think

18:06:07 Coach: I actually found an hour one, too. And I think you should be able to play those on your on your device as you're walking on your, phone or just listen to the audio says you're able to walk, so I'll send you some of the ones that I can find. But I think it would be helpful to pair it with something that you do and that you enjoy which is your walks, and if you just cut up like five minutes of the time to do that then you can still call you know anyone else that you want to call for that day. But I think that would work.

18:06:44 Participant: It's funny, it's gotten to the point now where if I don't call my mom it feels weird because I'm so used to it.

18:06:56 Coach: I think that sometimes its, as I call it conditioning, I would go home every weekend. So then mom expects it every week. You know, so sometimes we just get it let them know now you know things come up.

18:07:15 Participant: Oh okay.

18:07:21 Coach: And how many days this week, are you thinking?

18:07:25 Participant: We'll just do five.  I walk almost every day so we'll do five.

18:07:31 Coach: And do you walk at a specific time on a day 

18:07:40 Participant: Now it's between usually between classes but it is usually for about half an hour. 

18:07:5 Coach: Okay, so you'll, have a regular schedule. My team and I want to make sure that you have the time and if you don't have a time set that you think about when it is you are going to  do it because you already mentioned that you have it regularly scheduled during class.

18:07:59 Participant: I live in apartment so when my dog has to poop so you have to.

18:08:05 Coach: So you have something that reminds you need to do it , do you feel about being able to do this goal. 

18:08:10 Participant:  Yeah, I feel much more confident now yeah I feel like I could do it very easily

18:08:15 Coach: On a scale of one to ten.

18:08:17 Participant: Like an eight.

18:08:20 Coach: Awesome. You mentioned you were also thinking about another goal that was around food or something food.

18:08:37 Participant:  I'd like to cut down the takeout intake, so I mean that would be less of a.What is the word is more of a, it's a negative goals and set the right vocabulary were ones I'm trying to do something extra but this time I'm trying to cut back on something.

18:08:47 Coach: It's about cutting back and it's I mean it's just as good as everything else that that we said we just need to make sure that it's specific so for example if right now you're having takeout. And I'm just using this as an example. Let's say you're having take out seven days of the week. How much do you want to decrease that do you want to go down to five days, you want to go down to four, three, probably definitely sitting at a hot like at least four days a week.

18:09:19 Participant: So, if we could cut it down to two days a week, like cut it in half.

18:09:24 Coach: Yeah, that'd be good. And this is specifically for dinner. 

18:09:35 Participant: Yes, yeah dinner. Breakfast and lunch are easy because I'm by myself. I mean, my partner likes takeout. So I end up eating that because that's what's around.

18:09:40 Coach: Sometimes the habits that are a little bit difficult to break our when they're associated with someone else to. So you're gonna have to get them on board.

18:09:57 Participant: I know,

18:10:00 Coach: Like just FYI, they might not easily. But if they are then that would be a major win. And they will be good for both.

18:10:12 Participant: Right.

18:10:14 Coach: Okay, so you're thinking, decreasing, do you have a specific specific days in mind. Like what days do you want to designate for takeout night.

18:10:31 Participant: Friday and Saturday.

18:10:32 Coach: Okay. So then, those are the two days that you will do take at only Friday and Saturday and then the rest of the week you'll plan to either make something at home or what would be the backup plan for the other day, via, that's all there is the takeout. Worse comes to worse there is cereal right and you can have something else at home, that you can have us as a meal. And how confident, do you feel about being able to achieve this goal. That one's harder. 

18:10:50 Participant: Now I am less confident like maybe like a six. 

18:11:00 Coach: What do you think are some of the barriers that are going to come up and how can we foresee those and start thinking about problem solving?

18:11:42 Participant: It's just busy, because my partner doesn't really like to cook, and so I'm the one who ends up cooking which is fine because he'll clean afterwards, which I'm okay with I don't want to clean. So, but if I'm really busy. And I'm, you know, bogged down with the classwork or whatever, especially on Tuesdays and Thursdays because I have classes until 5:30. And then I can't start my homework until after that and so it's just. If I don't get around to it then we just take out. By then it's like, eight, nine o'clock and it's so late.

18:12:19 Coach: And what would be something that can help

18:12:26 Participant: Thats the million dollar question 

18:12:35 Coach:  Do you have days of the week that are I don't want to say not as busy as I feel every day has something and things come up, but more flexible with the time that you could maybe prepare a few meals ahead of time.

18:12:51 Participant: Yeah meal prepping I guess I can meal prep.

18:12:54 Coach: You don't have to do it for the whole week maybe just for those days where you know okay I'm not gonna have time today because I have class until late. So I want to prepare something ahead, just in case. 

18:13:04 Coach: Yeah, I could do that do like a meal prep or like a slow cooker kind of a meal and then you just put it in the morning and then it's done by the time it's dinnertime. 

18:13:15 Coach: That's a great idea to think of meals that you can make last, or that if you just add a little bit of something else to the side and become something to new.

18:13:29 Participant: My mom is like the queen of doing that, you know like, will make, she'll make pork shoulder and then we'll have something one night. I think she was really good at utilizing things right and making the most of it all. It made it feel like I wasn't eating the leftover stuff because I'm not a big fan of leftovers.

18:14:08 Coach: You make them into something new. I love that. Another idea would be on the next block, when you give her a call, ask her for ideas, you know, I have this, what can I do with it.

18:14:20 Participant: I guess I will because she's, actually was a nutritionist.

18:14:26 Coach: Perfect.So how confident, do you feel about being maybe like a seven now. Hey, seven and above is good for me. So we have two goals, one around, decreasing takeout and one around meditation, both has specific measurements or at least a way to count it two days of the week. What did you think about the messages this week anything that stood out to you. 

18:15:24 Participant: They were cute I like the little bit graphics, the pictures when they when it came through I thought they were cute. The only thing that I wish and maybe this would be something for thinking about for the program in the future is it's nice to get the generalized ones. Which are cool but it'd be, it'd be really cool if they were a little bit more personalized you know like so like, because my goal was nutrition and fruits and veggies base maybe like only getting fruits and veggie based tips that week. You know because I like the ones that were about food and then I get the ones with fitness and fitness releasing something that I need to work on and so I wanted more tips that were more cater to what my, what my goal was that week you know or like this week I would really love getting tips regarding lead nutrition stuff and then meditation stuff because that's like what I'm interested in what I'm working towards this week so I don't know something to think about for catering it for next year when you in when you guys open it up for the student body student body.

18:16:24 Coach: I think you bring up a great point. And I feel there is a way that we can do that, I'm thinking in the survey we have to ask ahead of time. What do they want to focus on like choose a topic, and that way we can just direct messaging related to, you know, for example, nutrition, physical activity physical activity. Yeah, like you subscribe to certain category, like for the text messages I think that would be really helpful and stuff and then you get to still have one every day for the, for the category that you're in, you know, instead of getting some that maybe don't necessarily apply to your weekly goal that week. Hey, I like that idea. Thank you. Anything else that you want to check in about this week.

18:17:16 Participant: No, I really just had successes that I wanted to share. No, I think the success was that it ended up,  that I liked that the habit, starting, I just putting like some extra fruit my oatmeal and then it kind of grew into something different like I had the extra fruit in my oatmeal, and then I was just kind of like thinking about okay well how can I make my meals more balanced now and so, you know, for lunch I added in like vegetables because I only usually have vegetables with dinner so it kind of added in and then now I have like a fruit yogurt, you know, dairy free fruit yogurt first day, you know, that kind of thing so I liked how it's kind of bleeding into more than just a breakfast habits, kind of bleeding into overall, a good eating habit, more than one meal. 

18:18:41 Coach: Now that's good and I know that's something that you really wanted to start to focus on the the nutrition aspect because although you eat regularly you want it to be able to addmore variety to your meals and include more vegetables and fruits, so I'm glad that it's more present, and that you're getting more ideas on how to do that. And I'll do my best to support and give ideas wherever I wherever possible. Okay, you think there's any other questions for you.

18:19:09 Participant: No I'm good

18:19:09 Coach: Ok good. We have very good goals for this week, I'll send you a reminder, just like we did last time. Do you find the email helpful? Just a little summary of what we discuss,   I'll include some of the meditation information that I find. 

18:19:30 Participant: Cool. Thank you.


18:21:28 Coach: Today was very productive. I love it.

18:21:32 Participant: Thank you.
