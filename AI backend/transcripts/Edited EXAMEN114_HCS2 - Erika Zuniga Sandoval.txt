13:02:09 Coach: Hello.

13:02:14 Participant: Hello.

13:02:16 Coach: How are you today?

13:02:18 Participant: Good, I just finished eating my lunch. Yeah. Sorry about the time change, it's like, it's been a little crazy. No worries. Today actually works because I don't have... I usually have a workshop that starts at 1:30, so I need to start the session a few minutes before. So I'm like "okay, we can do today," so today at the end we can revisit what's a better time.

13:02:46 Coach: Okay. Yeah, of course. Before we jump into any of the questions about messages, it's really good to meet you and see you. I know we met over the phone. But it's always great to put a name and a face together so thank you, Jennifer. And I know last week, your goal was to work on increasing water intake.

13:03:12 Participant: Yes.

13:03:14 Coach: And how did it go?

13:03:15 Participant: Good. I don't know if it was because like since I've been in the process of moving like it's just been tiring so I'm just kind of taking in this water. I don't know if it's that or I just been trying to drink more water but I definitely did. I know we had said that I was going to drink three water bottles. I think for... was it two days or three days, but two a day. Yeah, I actually drank at least like two waters every day so I definitely like passed my goal which I was pretty excited about because I've been doing that. So yeah, I think I did pretty good last week.

13:03:51 Coach: That's awesome. Glad to hear that. So on a scale of one to 10, how would you say that you did on meeting your goal?

13:04:04 Participant: I would say definitely like this past week, a 10 because I did... I surpassed the goal.

13:04:15 Coach: I fully agree. I think you're on a very good path. You mentioned that you've finished moving already?

13:04:23 Participant: Yeah.

13:04:25 Coach: You mentioned there's a few things going on this week so in terms of stress. On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate your level of stress for this week?

13:04:35 Participant: I definitely would say a nine, even though like I'm not... like I still have a lot of things to do inside the house like unpacking. It's also school. And work. That just kind of... I would say like a nine for this week.

13:04:52 Coach: Yeah, there's a lot of moving pieces, and for today's session, so today's session two. What are you... what are you hoping to check in about today or what do you want to focus on for this week? What are you thinking so far?

13:05:08 Participant: Yeah, like for... You mean like my mental health, or just kind of my health goals, or just anything?

13:05:18 Coach: Yeah, it can be around any of those things. So remember, the goal when we meet is to definitely work on goal setting. But I always leave it up to you to decide what topic you want to focus on, because then you're more likely to do it and it's something that you choose to do. So you mentioned mental health. Overall, how did you want to narrow it down a little bit more specific to one of those two?

13:05:46 Participant: Yeah. I think, probably, like taking care of myself a little more and I'm not sure how that looks like but I think with all the stress like sometimes I don't overeat but sometimes I'll like start eating a bunch of things or kind of what I said through text. It's... like the soda. Like for me right now it's like super hard to just like... I'm not drinking soda like 24/7, because I'm not like I had soda with soda but it's just like I have it here in the house so if I'm like, for dinner or something I'll just serve myself like a cup instead of like drinking water or drinking something else like more healthy. So I think, like in terms of taking care of myself and taking care of like my body a little more. Instead of stress eating or something.

13:06:40 Coach: Yeah, no, I hear you. So there's definitely some points you made earlier about things you want to focus on. And you had mentioned the soda intake before. And my hope was that with increasing the water intake that would actually help you so that you drink less soda, right? Because you're now you're hydrated and you don't need to reach out for that soda as much. I mean it's something that you enjoy and I always say everything in moderation. So if you can just find a way to limit that time. I think that should be fine. It's more of not wanting to do it every day that I hear you saying, but within that you also brought up this idea of taking care of yourself a little bit more. And that can be done in multiple ways right? That can be done in making sure you're drinking more water, or decreasing the amount of soda. But you also mentioned mental health and wanting to maybe focus a bit on that so what are some things that you've done in the past that have worked, and maybe that can give us some ideas of things that you could continue to do that could help?

13:08:01 Participant: I think, kind of like in the past, doing more like self care. I think I find myself struggling with self care a lot of the time so sometimes I'm like "God what is... what is self care to me." So I think like I kind of struggle with that a little bit but I think in the past what has helped is actually just having like me time whether it's me sitting on the couch, like watching some TV or like taking a nap or just kind of anything that helps me not be on the computer because I'm like on the computer like 24/7. So just kind of disengaging from social media, disengaging from like the computer and doing some self care. I know that's not super specific but I think that's just something that has helped me like disengaging from anything electronic.

13:08:58 Coach: Let me ask you... the area where you live. Is it like walk friendly, or anything like that?

13:09:06 Participant: Definitely.

13:09:08 Coach: So I'm just hearing because you mentioned you want to sort of get away from the computer, or screen. And I find that the best way to do that is... like today when you mentioned that we could push it back, I'm like "perfect I'll go for like a little walk outside," so I actually took like... It took me 10 minutes to get to one side of the place and then nine or 10 minutes to come back so even just 20 minutes of outdoor time, I think that would be the perfect self care. And it also gets you moving and it gets you outside. An idea but I'm sure that you might have other ideas and we can explore anything that you'd like.

13:09:54 Participant: Yeah, I think, I do some walks like with my dogs but of course it's not the same because I mean when I walk with my dogs, it's like, oh it's like their walk, so they go everywhere, versus if I were to go walk by myself, it's a little more relaxing, not stressing about my dogs barking because they bark at everybody and you know it's not as stressful so I think like walking can help. I think also something that like has helped me is like cooking. And, like in the past, because I feel like I just kind of like shut down and put like this wall and just start cooking and I don't listen to anybody. I just put like music on and I cook and I really enjoy cooking. So that has been something else that like has been kind of like helping. Yeah, I guess it's just I need to like disengage like after a certain time period like instead of like working so late, like I should set my hours, versus like just doing more work that I don't get paid for. I just do like volunteer work like later... late at night I'm like doing work and I'm like I actually could wait until the next morning so, yeah. Yeah, I mean I feel that especially now working from home a lot of things tend to just merge into each other so we find that we're actually working more hours than we would because you know now everything is just in your home and if there's some sort of little time you want to fill it in with something, sometimes it's hard because you do, but I fully agree with you that you still want to have some boundaries of "this is work and now this is my personal time," so that we can get adjusted and used to that sort of scheduling. Yeah, yeah, yeah I think you're right. I think it would... COVID because I used to be a little better before COVID, but now with COVID it's like I'm always like working even though I'm home, like I'm always working and then it doesn't help because then you get... you want a snack and you start snacking and, yeah, it's all these different things that kind of all rain down, but yeah, so...

13:12:22 Coach: I know for today, the goal is definitely to figure out what are some of those challenges that you've identified and how can we build a goal. So once again, something that is specific, achievable and has like that time attached to it so that it can help us to start making those changes in your habits. So what are you thinking of something specific that you could do this week that can help you with wanting to spend more me time? What is a specific activity that you could do, or a specific action?

13:13:08 Participant: I'm thinking maybe... I think maybe like walking alone like without my dogs like maybe having some headphones. Because I mean I walk four times a day with my dogs like for about like half an hour so I kind of at least get some sort of exercise throughout the day but it's not... I would say it's not something that I enjoy because like I said like sometimes like my dogs are barking so then I get mad at them and like having someone on the leash is not just kind of relaxing and where I moved there's like a little like area where it has like water. So just like a really nice view where I can just walk along the water, and like, listen to music and I think maybe that can help. Kind of... that kind of helps me leave the house instead of always working from home.

13:14:00 Coach: That can, you know, kind of kill two birds with one stone. I think you have a great point there. So when you're thinking about walking on your own, how many minutes do you think would be possible to do or distance?

13:14:16 Participant: I would say like something like doable, it's like 20 minutes.

13:14:22 Coach: And how many days this upcoming week?

13:14:26 Participant: I think I would start with three days.

13:14:32 Coach: And do you think this will be like a Monday through Friday or you want to use like the whole seven days to achieve this?

13:14:39 Participant: I would probably use the whole seven days.

13:14:45 Coach: Are there specific days that seem more possible than others? That way we can make the goal more specific. Like for example, on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, or I'm seeing for this week specifically?

13:15:00 Participant: Like a Friday, Saturday and Sunday would be more doable for me, more flexible.

13:15:08 Coach: And would you say that this is something that you're able to do in the morning or the afternoon?

13:15:15 Participant: Definitely afternoon. On the weekends I'm not really a morning person. Yeah, it's the only time I get to sleep in.

13:15:30 Coach:  I like that because then it's in the morning you walk your dogs then in the afternoon, it can be your walk for yourself. Yeah, then that way you also have that separation too. Perfect. So I have that you'll walk 20 minutes for three days. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and how confident do you feel about being able to do this?

13:16:04 Participant: I would say, like a nine.

13:16:08 Coach: Okay, that's very confident then. Is there another goal that you have in mind for this week or do you want to just start with the walking and see how that goes? Because I know you also have the increasing water intake last time, and I don't know if that's something that you also want to continue. What are you thinking?

13:16:29 Participant: Yeah, I would like to still continue the water intake, because I think that's something that I'm going to keep trying to do on a weekly basis, kind of be a little more healthy and drink more water because I haven't. So I would like to keep that goal.

13:16:46 Coach: Do you want to keep it the same? I think we were doing the two water bottles for three days during the week, did you want to do that again?

13:16:55 Participant: Yeah, I can, I think for the water since this past week was a little easier doing that, I think, like, even upping it to four. I think that would be... that could be four days.


13:17:10 Coach: Yeah, the same amount of water right.

13:17:16 Participant: Yeah, I have three dogs but there's only one that's just so high maintenance I'm like "oh that's why I hate working from home." They really are like children. They want your attention 24/7. I have friends that have kids and I think "he's looking at this with their kid" and yeah you think work is... working from home is interesting, because he wants my undivided attention and I have to work, or sometimes they bark and I'm like, "I am in the middle of the meeting and they start barking" I'm like "I'm so sorry, can you give me a minute" and then I have to like go and close the door like... get them.

13:18:02 Coach: That's the struggles right now with everybody working from home. For your goal of continuing with the water intake and increasing it, how confident do you feel about that on that scale of one to 10?

13:18:18 Participant: A 10, because I did really well this week. Yes I got your message and I was on my way to go... Yeah, it was like a surprise to my boyfriend. He was making fun of me because he was like "how was that hard" because he actually drinks like seven water bottles a day. I'm like "well you have an outside job so obviously you're drinking water all the time, you're outside all the time so you're thirsty and you just want water," but he was making fun of me but I'm like, "whatever I'm blocking you out."

13:18:44 Coach: It can be quite difficult, especially even just when we're not used to it, it takes a little bit of adjustment. I almost describe it a little bit as like when we try to decrease the amount of salt that we use because our taste buds get so used to a specific taste that even water when you start to drink water is like "this isn't, you know, satisfying me in any way shape or form." I can tell you I have this struggle with my mother. She does not like to drink water, she says it makes her want to vomit and...

13:19:18 Participant: They don't have... they don't have... like my mom always tells me the same thing.

13:19:23 Coach: Yeah. So finding creative ways to even maybe add like slices of some fruit, something that makes it fun, so that it's more exciting to you. But I mean water by itself is a good source of hydration.

13:19:47 Participant: It's culture too like my grandpa, and my grandma... just not water. Especially my grandpa like he would drink like three sodas a day for every single meal. And he just didn't believe in drinking water and yeah... yeah... Coca Cola. I was raised... the longest... That's what we would always drink, and I want to say that, buying Coke was cheaper than buying water, I don't remember ever going to the store and buying a water bottle as a kid. But I remember going to get those like two liter Cokes, because, yeah, it's always... that's always been a thing like having Coke in the fridge. But then I think once my grandparents moved out like my dad was like "no no more soda" and that's when I think I took a pause. But my grandpa would always like sneak in a soda like "oh here" like because he's like "it's not bad. It's not bad, like if you're going to die, you're going to die" and then now I know like I drank so much soda as a kid.

13:21:02 Coach: Yes! That is something that I see across so many of our families and family members, that same thing that you just said. "If I'm gonna die I'm gonna die" or like similar... like "I'm not gonna come on, what are you gonna do." Yeah, exactly. But the soda is so like bad for you in so many different ways like, I mean like my dad likes to drink soda like here and there, but not like it was like my grandpa and now my mom's taking that same habit. And then she doesn't like walking and she doesn't like doing these things and I'm like "that's why our culture is so unhealthy" like you guys just keep going, generation after generation. We sort of get used to a certain pattern of doing things that would, I would say. So it's, I think we're at a critical point that it's important for us to sort of make those modifications that, then we can pass on to like the next generations right so that they know that things can be done differently and as I mentioned earlier, with moderation I think it's important to just have that sort of embedded in our mindset. Yes, we can have some, but just don't overindulge, and I feel that in our families that's been a constant struggle of maybe at times we didn't have so much, and now that we do there's this overindulgence of it. I don't know if that makes any sense.

13:22:32 Participant: No, it makes sense. Yeah. At least that... I see it even in my family so it's definitely... it has been an ongoing struggle with them.

13:22:46 Coach: I think you have very good goals for this week, you have set yourself up really well. I did have one more question for you in terms of text messages that you received so far. Were there any messages that stood out to you? Any that motivated you to do something different?

13:23:09 Participant: Yeah, I think there was one... I kind of, I don't know if it was this morning. I think it was Saturday and I think I put a heart... let me see... oh it was on Sunday. I think it just like reminded me like of my goals because I think throughout the week like I can sometimes... I can forget it like you know I think I have to be more good with setting reminders like "are you actually completing your goal" but I think on Sunday when... And I think maybe it's just like the whole moving because I'm pretty good with like things like writing everything down and having everything in my head that I need to do but like I had forgotten for a bit so that reminder on Sunday that I got about like "how are you doing with your goal. How's your progress" like it kind of gave me a reality check like "whoa like I had some goals this week" and then I started thinking about, like I surpassed the goals and just kind of like... just like a question about my goals and my progress, it just kind of made me feel like "oh you're actually following up and checking to see if I followed through my goal" so that kind of helped and then I think the other one that I liked is the one that you sent on Friday. And it had like a USF picture on it and then it had like writing around it. I really like that one too. And it was about... I know it was about... "Can you contribute to social justice" and yeah. I really like that one too. I think for me, I'm just more... I like more pictures like if I ever want to do a post like I go and find it on social media and then I'll send it out. But that's just, you know, everybody has different ways.

13:24:59 Coach: I feel that's been a common feedback that we've received about the messages that people preferred photos or images. So I think that's definitely something that we'll take into account as we move forward. Very good. Well, I'm glad that you're getting the messages. Sometimes we had a few little glitches but everything's going really well so far. And yeah, anytime that you respond to a message, I get to see that so I get to respond back to you. So on Sunday, I actually sent you the message about how your... how is your goal going because that's sort of my weekly check in with you like "hey how are things going." It's good to just check in and see how things are. But I'm glad that it was a good reminder.

13:25:42 Participant: Yeah, and I'll continue to do that through this week, I'll check in with you about how your goal is going. I usually give you a few days that way you have some time to try it out and then maybe halfway through like "Hey, don't forget."

13:26:02 Coach: Yeah. And just like last time I also send you a summary of what we discussed today for the goals that you set.

13:26:09 Participant: I'm trying to think if there's any other... are there some resources that you will be interested in receiving? I know your goal was around water intake and I added some last time. This time, it was walking. There's walking meditation, but I think you want to start just by walking altogether because you mentioned you can listen to music.

13:26:34 Coach: Yeah I could send you some recordings if you're interested in maybe practicing some walking meditation, just as an idea too.

13:26:42 Participant: Yeah, that would be awesome.

13:26:48 Coach: You mentioned that you like cooking. But I'm assuming you have your own recipes, or do you want information about a site that has healthy recipes?

13:26:58 Participant: Yeah, I always like... even though I kind of have some of the things I like to cook like I always like to receive like new recipes like it's just so fascinating to me. So, yeah.

13:27:12 Coach: And let me know if that's too much. It might get you thinking about a goal for the following week because I know you mentioned that you enjoy cooking. So, it could also be, you know, a plan to maybe try a new recipe or something. Well thank you so much for your time. Before we go, next week what are you thinking, what will be a better time? Let's look at that. Oh yeah, you said not at 1pm next week right, next week is the fourth?

13:27:47 Participant: Correct, yes. I have to start the session at 1:15 or so. I can ask them if I can start it at 1:20, and then we could do 1:00 to 1:20.

13:28:06 Coach: Yeah, or even because today we finished at 1:45 so we can even do 12:45 if that works.

13:28:12 Participant: Yeah, that would totally work. 12:45 to, like, at least 30 minutes.

13:28:20 Coach: Okay. Perfect. I'll send you an updated calendar invite then. Perfect. Yeah, thanks for being flexible.

13:28:28 Participant: So I won't... again no no no worries, just let me know. And I'm sorry, I got to check the email this morning so thank you for sending a text because I saw that behind quicker.

13:28:42 Coach: Okay, so 12:45. If anything comes up just let me know. If you get done a little bit earlier, let me know.

13:28:48 Participant: Usually, I have my lunch break from 12 to 1, but that's flexible so I can move it around too.
