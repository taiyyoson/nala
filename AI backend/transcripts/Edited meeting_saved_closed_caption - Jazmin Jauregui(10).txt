19:46:15 Participant: How are you?

19:46:17 Coach: Good, how are you?

19:46:20 Participant: I'm okay.

19:46:23 Coach: What does okay mean for you?

19:46:27 Participant: I'm just tired, I have like some assignments due today. A project due tomorrow, so I feel like I'm kind of stressing but I'm like okay like I'm not like in a rush to do things. I just ordered food so I feel like I'll do homework after I eat.

19:46:49 Coach: Okay, well I'll definitely be mindful of your time, and we can just jump right into it, if that works out well. So, since you did kind of mention your stress I'll just hit that question first. On a scale of one to 10, what was your stress level this week?

19:47:17 Participant: I don't know if I'm like thinking about my stress level right now but I definitely like cried myself to sleep a few days ago. I think it's... it's not like I'm not stressed. I feel like I'm all like a three or four maybe at the very most, but I just felt very unmotivated and tired. That's why I was like crying because it's like I've never been a bad student.

19:47:43 Coach: I know it's a very stressful time in the semester too. So I can imagine, everything maybe feeling overwhelming, like you need a break because we do need a break.

19:48:04 Participant: Totally agree. I think that like I feel like I'm never really stressed about work. Today, like yesterday, like parents and kids were like just testing me and I could not.

19:48:23 Coach: The semester is winding down for your students too and parents might be freaking out about their grades and all of that stuff. A lot of, I feel like teachers usually get a lot of or hold a lot of the responsibility in educating students when it's more of a community effort. Sorry, my internet has been really bad today so sorry if there's a small lag, or large lag.

19:49:02 Participant: I think it's like everyone's. A few of my classmates so like I'm going to turn my camera off because my internet... Like, it's not just mine but everybody.

19:49:21 Coach: Feel free to keep your camera off to see if it helps your connection. So, let me go into the text messages and then we'll go into your health goals. What messages stood out? Did any of them motivate you, any feedback?

19:49:41 Participant: I think the one telling me to like take a break. I literally looked at it and I was like, I guess I'm going to go on a walk. So, that was cool. Especially because it tells you what to take a break from you know like the computer or TV. You know I've been watching Netflix. I have been staring at my screen the whole time and so it's like okay cool I need a break from electronics and I needed a break for like my eyes.

19:50:16 Coach: Cool. Any other comments on the text messages?

19:50:21 Participant: The one about the fruit definitely like made me crazy, so I went and ate a lot of strawberries. But I think... I enjoyed them, you know.

19:50:35 Coach: Cool. Yeah, that one I love. It just reminds me so much of Mexico and like, I wish I could just go down the street and get something like that. So then transitioning towards your health goals. How do you think you did in meeting your goals this week on a scale of one to 10?

19:51:08 Participant: It depends on the goals.

19:51:10 Coach: Okay, so you could tell me one by one. What are your thoughts?

19:51:14 Participant: I'm thinking about the one where I drink water, I definitely drank more water than usual. But it wasn't the eight cups that I wanted, it was more of like three or four. Until like my plant died one day and I was like... Okay, I still have, like, a quarter left of my cup from before class, and then I just drank it like during class. I took my dogs out for a walk. I let my coworkers know that I was going on a walk too. So I think the walk one was okay.

19:52:06 Coach: So, what would you say for that one on the scale of one to 10?

19:52:10 Participant: The walk one was like a seven or eight. I did not go twice a day but I made sure to go at least once. And I think that's because like my class ends at 12:15 and I don't want to like eat breakfast too so I'll cook during my lunch. And so, no time for me to go on the walk until it's after three, so I made sure to go at three if I didn't go at all. So the midday one was a struggle.

19:52:52 Coach: Yeah. Well, can you tell me a little bit about... Did you notice any positive effects from either drinking more water or from taking those walks at 3pm?

19:53:20 Participant: I think the water one was more like a personal goal so I could like hydrate and all I got was having to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes. I can't... I didn't hear what you said before, what did you say? Something about the walking goal?

19:53:38 Coach: And then... it made you more positive before class? So, what would you like to focus on this week for your health goals or health goal? We can stick to one, no pressure to do more than that.

19:54:11 Participant: I think still working on going on walks twice a day. To get some kind of exercise and like get my eyes away from the screen and stuff. And eating fruits, because I feel like since I stopped making that a goal like I have not.

19:54:37 Coach: So for the first goal around walking, I know you said you had a challenge with the midday walk. What's another time that would work for you to go for a walk?

19:54:51 Participant: I don't know, probably like after class around this time now. Maybe like 8:30 depending on my class. So I'm still trying to do the 12:15 one. So, 12:15, 3pm, 8:30 for backup.

19:55:21 Coach: And then, did we set these for 10 minutes each? So the walks, how long were you walking for?

19:55:35 Participant: 15 minutes.

19:55:43 Coach: And then do you want to do this every day, or do you want to just have this goal for three days out of the week?

19:55:52 Participant: I think every day, at least Monday through Friday.

19:56:02 Coach: So let's see... why is this goal important to you? The walking one.

19:56:09 Participant: Yes, it gets me to look at something else besides my screen. And it helps me realize like... or not realize, it helps me think about like taking care of myself and being active.

19:56:29 Coach: So on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting this goal?

19:56:37 Participant: I think like a seven.

19:56:41 Coach: What do you need to help you meet this goal?

19:56:50 Participant: Probably time management.

19:56:53 Coach: What would that look like?

19:56:58 Participant: I think it means like staying focused in class so I can leave class early and be able to go on the walk, because if I don't understand the class I'll stay later for tutoring and stuff. And that like interrupts my time to go on the walk.

19:57:34 Coach: Is there anything that I can do to help you meet your walking goal?

19:57:40 Participant: No.

19:57:47 Coach: Anything you'd like to add about that goal specifically?

19:57:54 Participant: No.

19:57:56 Coach: Let me just repeat it back to you. In the next week you will go for two 15 minute walks throughout the day, Monday through Friday. Times: 12:15, 3pm, and then 8:30 for backup. I'm sorry, it's not 8:30, it's like... do you end class at seven o'clock, or 7:30?

19:58:13 Participant: Either works fine.

19:58:16 Coach: Either works fine. I'll just put some time for backup. Okay, cool. And then for your second goal, it was to increase your servings of fruit?

19:58:32 Participant: Yes.

19:58:34 Coach: Can you say a little more? In the next week, I will...

19:58:48 Participant: In the next week, I will make sure to eat fruit or vegetable, at least twice a day.

19:58:52 Coach: So, how many servings?

19:58:55 Participant: Two. Oh, I guess, yeah. Okay, that makes sense. I'm thinking about it... like, does one apple count as one serving?

19:59:02 Coach: Yeah.

19:59:07 Participant: I won't eat one strawberry though, you know. Two servings of fruit, each day.

19:59:15 Coach: And then, is this a goal that you want to have every day, three, four days of the week, Monday through Friday, what seems possible?

19:59:25 Participant: Yeah, every day.

19:59:28 Coach: And then do you have access to fruits?

19:59:33 Participant: Yes, I bought some strawberries recently.

19:59:37 Coach: Any other things you have?

19:59:40 Participant: I also bought cuties, the oranges, the tangerines. Is that going to be enough for the next... Thursday, Friday, five days, sorry.

19:59:58 Coach: That's okay. And you have oranges too?

20:00:03 Participant: I think, I think so. I could always go out to buy more during the week.

20:00:13 Coach: And then, why is this goal important to you?

20:00:20 Participant: This goal is important because it helps me eat healthier and stay healthy.

20:00:33 Coach: So on a scale of one to 10, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

20:00:39 Participant: 4.

20:00:41 Coach: Okay, what are those challenges that you're anticipating?

20:00:49 Participant: I think just forgetting or not having time. Yeah, maybe like it's easy, you just reach over and like there's a fruit right there. But I think because like my presentations I have this week and next week, I'm just gonna like forget.

20:01:07 Coach: So you're anticipating like maybe not high stress but like high stress times that might prohibit doing this... Okay. So what would be helpful? Like, I'll give you an example - I had one participant who like had a goal around drinking water, and was like "Jasmine, it would be super helpful if you send me like random water reminders, like throughout the day." Would it be helpful if I did that for you, a fruit reminder?

20:01:46 Participant: Sure. Yeah.

20:01:51 Coach: Is there anything else that I can do to help you meet your goal?

20:01:58 Participant: I think just the text messages are fine.

20:02:01 Coach: Okay. Does that boost your confidence at all?

20:02:16 Participant: Yeah.

20:02:18 Coach: What would you say it boosts your confidence level to?

20:02:20 Participant: I think like a nine, like a nine or 10.

20:02:22 Coach: And then, do you want two text messages a day, or just one text message?

20:02:30 Participant: I think one should be enough.

20:02:32 Coach: And the other thing is... or not, or I guess, let me say this. I misinterpreted it. But, oh no, did I freeze? Did you want to eat like two servings of fruit at two different times of the day, or do you just... like for example if you eat a serving of strawberries and an orange at the same time, does that like meet your goal?

20:03:01 Participant: I think twice a day like different times. So like maybe one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

20:03:09 Coach: Okay. Gotcha. Sorry, what did you say about one or two text message reminders?

20:03:21 Participant: You could send it in like the morning for like the morning time when I should eat fruit and like the afternoon.

20:03:41 Coach: Okay. And what are good times?

20:03:45 Participant: I think... what did you say about one o'clock?

20:03:48 Coach: One ... sorry.

20:03:52 Participant: I think anytime after nine.

20:03:57 Coach: And then for the afternoon?

20:04:00 Participant: I think anytime like after three.

20:04:14 Coach: Cool. Do you have any other questions before we sign off? So I'll email these to you. If you need any help, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm sorry, this was like such a short session. I know you have a lot on your plate so thanks for like bearing with me.

20:04:44 Participant: Thank you so much.

20:04:46 Coach: Yeah, good luck with everything and I'll see you... oh we need to reschedule for next week, right? We haven't done that yet. Okay, let me look at the calendar real quick. So next week is Cinco de Mayo. Do you want to meet at 7:30 again, or is there another date or time that works better for you?

20:05:14 Participant: I think I won't be here for Cinco de Mayo. I have a thing I'm doing that night.

20:05:23 Coach: Okay. Yeah, you have class and then you're going to hang out.

20:05:42 Participant: 7:30 to 10:30. Oh I don't work next week so I'm fine. Yeah. Next week, I have a thing I'm going to on Wednesday, though.

20:05:55 Coach: Would you want to meet Thursday, then?

20:05:58 Participant: Yes we could definitely do Thursday.

20:06:02 Coach: I think the earliest I can meet on Thursday is like around 5:15, 6:15 or 7:15.

20:06:13 Participant: Thursdays are my long days with the two practicum things so... oh so what time do you get off? 8:30?

20:06:28 Coach: Let me... I wonder if you're the 8:15 appointment that I have noted here?

20:06:42 Participant: Maybe, I don't know. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah so I do have you for 8:15 on Thursday, but do you want to push that to 8:30?

20:06:56 Coach: Yes, please.

20:07:01 Participant: Perfect. Alrighty, well, that covers that. Any questions?

20:07:07 Coach: No, no questions.

20:07:09 Participant: Okay. Well, best of luck to you, you've got this. Try to get some rest. And if you need anything, let me know.
