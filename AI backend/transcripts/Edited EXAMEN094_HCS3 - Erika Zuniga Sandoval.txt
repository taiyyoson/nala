10:00:38 Coach: Good morning, how's it going today. Today is our session three. How did it go? How did you do with meeting your goals. If you could give it a rating on terms of progress on one to 10, what would you give it.

10:01:05 Participant: I think for my exercise goal I would give it probably still an 8 because there was a day where I was just like, No, not today. But I'm still keeping up for the most part. And then for my eating goals, I did eat breakfast every day of the week so I would give that a 10. And then in terms of incorporating fruits and vegetables, I would give it like a seven. I could do better for sure but there was definitely more of an incorporation this week.

10:01:39 Coach: Okay. Well, I know you really wanted to work on eating something in the mornings. Great job on that, and a very good start on thinking about how to add more variety in fruits and vegetables. Very good. And in terms of stress this last week on that scale of one to 10, how would you say that your stress level was.

10:02:06 Participant: I think this last week would be more of like a six.

10:02:13 Coach: Semester's coming to an end for you too.

10:02:19 Participant: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of moving pieces.

10:02:23 Coach: See, and what are you hoping to check in about today?

10:02:30 Participant: Oh nothing in particular, it's really just keeping up with what I'm trying to work on. I think maybe something small that I'm noticing is that I don't get outside as much as I need to every day. Especially since it's getting nicer out, I'm noticing that I want to be outside more. So maybe trying to make sure I get outside at least every day for 30 minutes just to get some sun. That would be nice.

10:03:08 Coach: So, as you're thinking of your goals for this upcoming week, are you thinking you want to continue the physical activity and the eating breakfast, and add getting outdoors?

10:03:23 Participant: Yeah.

10:03:23 Coach: So in going outdoors, you mentioned 30 minutes, right? How many days during the week?

10:03:48 Participant: I would say at least six days a week.

10:03:58 Coach: And your idea is just to get out there and maybe go for a walk, or do you have a specific activity that you want to do that will absolutely get you to go out?

10:04:15 Participant: Definitely walking my dog. I haven’t been so great with that lately. One thing is walking my dog for sure, but also gardening. My mom is going outside a lot more, and I help her with that. So I think kind of being outside and doing some yard work is another good thing.

10:04:33 Coach: Yeah, I always think — is there an activity I can associate it with? That way it'll remind me, okay now I need to go do this. I think you have at least two really good ideas: walking the dog or helping your mom with gardening. For the previous goals, for example eating breakfast and physical activity, do you want to make any adjustments, or keep them the same? For example, eating a morning meal seven days a week, and physical activity — the 45-minute workout (15 minutes cardio, 30 minutes strengthening four days a week). Do you want to keep those too?

10:05:32 Participant: Yes, keep those.

10:05:32 Coach: Okay, let me just write them out in our sheet so we can send you a summary. I'll do the confidence level at the end. Did you find the summary email I sent over somewhat helpful? I've been trying to include some resources.

10:06:03 Participant: Yes, definitely helpful. I want to do the french toast sticks. I haven't yet but I want to this weekend. Growing up we always had those french toast sticks. I like French toast but I never think to cut them up to make it easier, even as a to-go meal.

10:06:36 Coach: Lovely. Yeah, I remember we talked about how you like French toast. I wonder if they have a recipe for that on this site. The site has a lot of recipes meant to make healthy eating easier, right? It has quite a few recipes. I tried to find some I would try. I saw French toast, and actually that Friday I went into the office, there's a little café next door, and they had a version of French toast. I had some, and I was thinking about you, because you planned it!

10:07:35 Participant: Yeah, I did actually have French toast. I went out to eat with a coworker and got French toast. It was perfect.

10:07:49 Coach: That’s so funny! Okay, so when you're thinking about your previous goal of eating a morning meal seven days a week, how confident are you that you can continue to do that on a scale of one to 10?

10:08:08 Participant: A 10.

10:08:23 Coach: Good job! And for physical activity — the 45 minutes — how confident do you feel about being able to do that?

10:08:29 Participant: An eight.

10:08:34 Coach: Still in the mornings?

10:08:46 Participant: Yeah.

10:08:50 Coach: Okay, and then the third one: going outdoors for 30 minutes at least six days during the week, whether walking the dog or gardening. Is there a specific time during the day you're thinking?

10:09:06 Participant: Not really, but probably middle of the day.

10:09:13 Coach: The more specific we can make it, the more it helps. How confident do you feel about being able to get outdoors for 30 minutes?

10:09:43 Participant: An eight.

10:09:47 Coach: That was really fast! I think it helps that you’re continuing with your previous goals. You're good for this week. Were there any text messages that stood out to you this week? Anything that motivated you to change something or do something different?

10:10:12 Participant: The text from this morning about taking five minutes of mindfulness. It made me think of going outside. I want to set up a little bench area in the backyard to sit and relax. That stood out.

10:10:37 Coach: That’s a great point — going outside doesn’t have to be physical. It could be as simple as sitting outdoors and practicing mindfulness.

10:10:58 Participant: Yeah.

10:11:07 Coach: Good options. What are some other successes this week, or challenges you’re still facing?

10:11:31 Participant: Success wise, eating breakfast. Challenge wise, it's hard to stay motivated to exercise and go out, especially when my back is aching. That’s because I’m not as active as I usually am. Problem solving is just being consistent with working out, and eventually the aches will go away.

10:12:06 Coach: Exactly — when we don’t have as much physical activity, our body lets us know. It takes time to adjust. Since you’ve been working on physical activity for at least two weeks now, have you noticed improvements?

10:12:32 Participant: Yeah, right now it’s mostly soreness. For me, the improvement shows up like a month later. I just need to be patient.

10:12:49 Coach: Yes, give new habits time. Sometimes more than two weeks. Long-term consistency will make a difference. And you can keep it fun by changing up activities so you stay motivated.

10:14:21 Participant: Luckily it's only two classes, so I can survive that. I’m also back at work so that’s nice — I’m more active in my day.

10:14:37 Coach: So you’re going into the office now instead of working from home? That helps with routine, commuting, and being up early.

10:15:00 Participant: Yes, it’s just the next town over.

10:15:24 Coach: Okay. Were there any resources I can provide you this week?

10:15:49 Participant: Maybe just more food or smoothie ideas, but nothing extensive.

10:16:00 Coach: Okay, I’ll send some if I find good ones. I’ve also been making more fruit smoothies myself with the warmer weather. That’s all for today. I know you have things to get done, so I won’t take more of your time. Next week will be our last session. I’ll give more details then about next steps. Come ready to think about goals you want to continue, whether the same or new ones.
