17:32:40 Coach: Hello.

17:32:44 Participant: How's it going? It's going better, I'm doing better today.

17:32:50 Coach: Yeah. You want to say a little more about... you don't have to like say anything personal, but if you want to say more.

17:33:01 Participant: Um, yeah, I mean I've just been getting like a lot more breath, and then this morning I was able to practice yoga so yeah that was nice. And then Monday I went on a walk with my friends for like two hours so that was nice. Yeah, I was late to end class but it was nice because I like haven't walked for a long time like for that, you know. And then, let's see, yeah, I've like been more productive. But it's also because like this week has been really really busy for me. So I think it's also like my anxiety, like telling me to like do stuff. So, yeah.

17:33:54 Coach: So you're feeling a little bit anxious but in a way, it's helping you get through your busy week.

17:33:57 Participant: Yeah, yeah, but I know like after I'm gonna crash, and then I'm gonna be tired. So, um, you know.

17:34:17 Coach: Do you think that there's anything preventative you can do to manage that crash?

17:34:28 Participant: Maybe like practice self care so it doesn't like get too bad. Like, take time off my laptop or like my screen time. And then maybe like your face mask or something like take a bath is one of my favorite ones, or like shopping I know it's really bad but retail therapy.

17:34:53 Coach: Yes. Okay, there's some really good ideas, um, I especially like the take a break from screen.

17:36:03 Participant: Yes.

17:36:04 Coach: Okay, well if it's okay with you I'm just going to jump in with a couple of questions and then we can transition to what you want to focus on for the week. For sure, the first question is around the health messages that you've been receiving and which ones stood out to you, are you liking any of them or are they motivating you in some way?

17:36:35 Participant: I like the traffic one overnight, especially because like one of the graphics this one. Yeah, she's like, cuz what I've been noticing with like social media and like marketing is that they usually put like the skinny blonde woman, you know, and so I like how her, her body size and color. And then I like the one from Tuesday, was nice. And then your personal tech. The Monday one. "I hope you had a chance to stop and smell the Florida." Yeah, but they're really, really helpful.

17:37:27 Coach: Yeah, we like to sprinkle in a little bit of everything so a little bit around physical activity, a little bit of like, spiritual or like mental health emotional health, things like that. So cool. Yeah. And also thank you for the compliment because I created the graphics.

17:37:50 Participant: Did you like Canva or something?

17:37:53 Coach: Yeah, I did. Um, so, there's a few more to come. So, let me know which ones you like. And then another question that I have for you is around like your stress level. So on a scale of one to ten what was your stress level for the week?

17:38:22 Participant: Wait, sorry when did we last meet?

17:38:26 Coach: Um, that's a good question. Let's see. We met last Thursday. So it's been a week.

17:38:37 Participant: Yeah, so I would say a ten. Unfortunately my dog died on Friday morning. Yeah, so like, it's been a lot for my family and I. And then I'm also running for ASUS representative. So like campaign week has also been a lot so, yeah.

17:39:03 Coach: I'm so sorry to hear about your dog.

17:39:07 Participant: Okay. She was suffering a lot so like. It's tough to say but like I'd rather see her go in like peace and not suffer, like see her suffer. Seeing her suffer was like really traumatizing, to say the least.

17:39:23 Coach: Well, may she rest in peace or they rest in peace. And I know you mentioned also like campaigning. How has that been going and when will you know the results?

17:39:41 Participant: Um, I will know April 25, I think, Monday, yeah Monday. And it's been going pretty well I've been getting a lot of support. But definitely, I have to like, I've had to step out of my comfort zone and like talk to a lot of people. And like that like public speaking just gives me a lot of anxiety, definitely like working on. But I've noticed that like a lot of people struggle with public speaking like I'm not the only one. So, yeah, and but it's been going pretty good. Definitely. People have been very supportive and Mike has been reaching out, you know, that's nice, it's been very, very helpful.

17:40:24 Coach: Yeah. I think it's. So, all the nerves are good nerves, for the most part, they don't feel great, but they come from a good place.

17:40:45 Participant: Yeah. Oh wait, give me one second. Sorry. Okay. I have like an adrenaline rush but it like helped me in a way. And I've been, I've been noticing that like I, I'm like super bubbly and like super smiley when I get super nervous which like is a good thing, you know. Like last year I interviewed for Apple, and I was so nervous because I was interviewing with like the, not the CEO but like the manager of the store. And I did really good even though I was so nervous. And like I was super outgoing like super super friendly like laughing a lot, like, you know, in the right situation. And today I had to present myself in front of all the candidates. And I think it went pretty good like I could have done better but yeah like the good nerves that helped me a lot.

17:42:25 Coach: Yeah. Um, and, you know, the nervousness will go away after a while, maybe not ever, but like, yeah, it's just about practice, once you get the hang of it you'll feel a little more comfortable. Even like actors get stage fright sometimes. Um, so going back to like your health goals that you had set last week, around practicing yoga, and Pilates I think it was. How did you do in meeting your health goals on a scale of one to ten, how do you think you did?

17:43:09 Participant: Um, I think I got, I think like an eight, because I did yoga twice. And I did my poor walk which I've never done before. And I brought a friend with me because, well, I can go alone but my parents would freak. Don't go alone because they felt like the neighborhood, you know. But yeah, I gave myself because I feel like I could have done more, you know, but I still like did stuff.

17:43:49 Coach: Um, and then. So, remind me did we end up setting the yoga goal for four days and then...

17:43:56 Participant: No.

17:43:58 Coach: Oh yeah, sorry.

17:43:58 Participant: Oh, it was three days, you said four and then we went down to three. Okay, cool.

17:44:06 Coach: So that's a little more manageable like that was a good adjustment that we made before.

17:44:10 Participant: Yeah. Awesome.

17:44:12 Coach: So yeah, I didn't get to work out though, so I'm sorry about that. But, um, I think, you know, taking a walk for two hours is not an easy thing. And if you want to consider that the workout we could but if you want to consider it that's also, you know, we can do that.

17:44:33 Participant: Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

17:44:38 Coach: Um, so for this week. What are you wanting to focus on? We can, you can do the same goals as before, or you can come up with new goals if something feels more relevant.

17:44:52 Participant: Now, I want to try like meditation. So let's say meditation two times.
And then yoga. What.

17:45:12 Coach: So, how long do you want to meditate for?

17:45:18 Participant: Maybe like ten minutes in the morning and then ten minutes at night.

17:45:32 Coach: And you said for two days.

17:45:35 Participant: Yeah.

17:45:40 Coach: Um, do you want to specify which days? You don't have to if you don't want to but just... When do we meet again sorry? We have it for the 21st Wednesday.

17:46:10 Participant: 21st?

17:46:12 Coach: Oh yeah.

17:46:20 Participant: What, let's do Monday morning and night from the 19th. And then maybe like tomorrow. Friday.

17:46:49 Coach: April 19th.

17:46:53 Participant: Yeah, April 19. Okay, cool.

17:46:57 Coach: And then, in terms of, like, needing resources, do you have like a meditation app. Do you want me to send you like ten minute meditation videos off of YouTube? What kind of things do you need to do this?

17:47:17 Participant: Um, I actually do look them up on YouTube, sometimes. In the past, I've like adjusted to what I need. So like for example I put like morning meditation for like stress or anxiety relief. Or like, other times I just put like morning meditation for like positivity. So yeah, I have a couple in my playlist. But thank you. Yeah, and then I also use Headspace as well.

17:47:48 Coach: Cool. Yeah, I think a lot of people use Headspace, I have a good, good experience with that. Um, and so, you mentioned, like wanting to do this specifically in the morning and then at night, what would be a good time to do this in the morning?

17:48:11 Participant: Well tomorrow, I have to go to mom to work at like eight. So I probably do it at like 7:15 in the morning.

17:48:26 Coach: And then what about the evening time?

17:48:31 Participant: Maybe like before you go to bed. Like, um. Yeah.

17:48:39 Coach: And then what about Monday? Is it helpful to like set up a time?

17:48:47 Participant: Yeah. My dad like. I mean I don't really know but like maybe 8:30, I usually wake up.

17:48:56 Participant: And then it's your bedtime usually like around ten to... actually. Sorry, let's change it to like eleven, because I usually sleep late.

17:49:12 Coach: Do you want to do that for Friday and Monday or just Monday?

17:49:22 Coach: Okay. And then, um, so, um, I'm not sure if you remember, but we're setting up these goals, using like the SMART goal method which is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and timely. So I think right now we have everything, besides the R so you wrote "in the next week you will meditate for ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes at night for two days of the week specifically Friday and Monday." So, what the R is, we just want to know like why is this goal important to you?

17:50:06 Participant: Then meditation, because I've been noticing that meditation has been helping a lot with like my depression, and my mental health issues. And it just makes me feel a lot more connected to myself.

17:50:21 Coach: Yeah. So, there's a lot of good that can come from meditating two times a day on those two days.

17:50:38 Participant: Oh.

17:50:40 Coach: Alrighty. Um, do you feel like you have everything you need to meet this SMART goal?

17:50:48 Participant: Yes, I do.

17:50:49 Coach: Okay. Um, so a confidence scale question, what's your confidence level in meeting your SMART goal?

17:51:03 Participant: Ten.

17:51:06 Coach: Yeah. Awesome. That's a good one. And then you wanted to set up another one around yoga.

17:51:14 Participant: And yet. And then can we do like one more workout like once a week?

17:51:23 Coach: Cool, yoga. How long do you want to practice yoga for?

17:51:27 Participant: I'm just once a week, and then we can do one day.

17:51:40 Coach: And then, do you want to practice yoga for 30 minutes, 20 minutes?

17:51:46 Participant: 20 minutes.

17:51:52 Coach: So you will practice yoga for 20 minutes on Wednesday, and then. Would you say that this is important to you for the same reasons as before?
17:52:17 Participant: Yeah.

17:52:18 Coach: Okay. And then what about your confidence level with this goal as well?

17:52:27 Participant: Ten. It's gonna be a good week.

17:52:31 Coach: Alright, and then in the next week you will, and you said workout.

17:52:38 Participant: Yeah, once a week, and then we can do like Tuesday morning today.

17:52:54 Coach: Okay. So in the next week you will workout for how long? Sorry.

17:53:00 Participant: I want to do 30 minutes.

17:53:03 Coach: 30 minutes on Tuesday morning.

17:53:09 Participant: Yeah.

17:53:09 Coach: Um, let's see. I remember last time you had sent me a video of like someone that you follow on YouTube. So you'll just use that video as well, one of the videos?

17:53:25 Participant: Yeah.

17:53:27 Coach: And then, do you foresee any challenges in meeting this health goal?

17:53:33 Participant: Not. No, no. I'm going to like really stick to it.

17:53:39 Coach: Okay. Do you need any reminders, text messages, calendar invites, anything like that, that would be helpful?

17:53:51 Participant: Yeah. Text reminders.

17:53:57 Coach: Do you want to do the calendar, like do you want to send yourself a calendar invite or do you want me to send you a calendar invite?

17:54:05 Participant: You.

17:54:08 Coach: Yeah. Sure, I can do that. And then, so in that case. Do you want, like you mentioned, you were going to practice yoga for 20 minutes on the Wednesday morning, or at night, or is there a good time for me to send that invite?

17:54:31 Participant: Oh, maybe like for night time.


17:54:44 Coach: Like, yeah. Okay, like 5pm?

17:54:46 Participant: Yeah, that works. Yeah.

17:54:48 Coach: And then what about the workout one? Does this... or did you say Tuesday morning? I might have added the morning part.

17:55:02 Participant: Tuesday morning, like 7:30am.

17:55:10 Coach: Yeah. And then for the workout one, specifically, what's your confidence level in meeting that goal?

17:55:22 Participant: There's a workout, ten as well.

17:55:31 Coach: So, let me just kind of summarize all of this and then if you feel good about it, then we can just check in about the next time we meet, so the first goal that you have for yourself is in the next week you will meditate for ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes at night for two days of the week specifically Friday and Monday. And then your next SMART goal is in the next week you'll practice yoga for 20 minutes on Wednesday. And then in the next week you'll work out for 30 minutes on Tuesday morning. And all of these smart goals are important to you because it'll help manage your depression and overall mental health, as well as help you feel connected with yourself.

17:56:24 Participant: Yeah.

17:56:26 Coach: Cool. Um, so then next week, we meet at 6:15 on Wednesday. Does that time still work for you?

17:56:33 Participant: Yeah.

17:56:34 Coach: Yeah. Cool. And then I'll send you an email, as well as check in with you through text message every once in a while if that's okay.

17:56:47 Participant: Yeah.

17:56:49 Coach: Okay, cool. Any questions for me?

17:56:54 Participant: No. Yeah, just putting everything in my calendar so I don't forget.

17:57:06 Coach: Also, to, um, well then, hope you have a good evening.
