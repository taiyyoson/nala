What really attracted me in the language that you used as part of the research, you know, the questions. The first questions that I received was about the spiritual, and I thought that was really interesting because I'm constantly thinking about my health and what I eat and how much I move and if I you know had enough exercise.

You get the picture.","Now I totally get it. I actually think it's something that especially as Latina women we tend to be very conflicted about. Either we are at one extreme of spirituality or at the other. And I really want to make sure that during this program, our goal is not really to move you to one extreme or the other. It's really to find a middle ground that helps you stay grounded and that helps your well being.

I wake up and I do my thing so I get into, you know, the mindset of what needs to be done.

So, you know, when you're a freshman in college I was told like the ""college 15"" because like you just gained like weight. So like for me like in high school and even as a kid I was never allowed to like eat certain like sugary foods or processed foods because my parents were like, ""no, don't eat that"" like it was really fresh. So when I finally got to college, I was like, ""I can eat this stuff."" So I gained a lot of weight, and then the issue was that I was always used to continuously working out because I did sports in high school, and even in middle school. So I realized I didn't have sports to balance out my eating like I did before. So since then it's kind of like, been a journey of just kind of like getting back into shape, like how I was like before. I guess now more recently because I've been getting busier now that I started work and I used to start working like in the past years also after freshman year, it's a little bit harder to maintain like continuously working out because you're tired, you don't feel like waking up so early because you're also tired from classes. And then now it's kind of just like with COVID I feel like more sluggish. Just because everything seems to be going really slowly and everything's all online it's like, it's a little bit harder to get out sometimes. So that's why I wanted to do this because I was like, ""Oh, it'd be a good way of just like getting an extra reminder from, like, you know, besides myself just like, do something."" That way I can stick with working out continuously because I start doing it and then I have trouble following through with it because then I get tired.","I wonder too if like how you're saying the current situation, the current status of our world is impacting your energy and motivation or determination to continue with the goal that you've set for yourself.

"For me, it was just a way to also just get out stress. I'm a very physical person like I have to do something in order to really work out my stress and then also like any anxiety. And so, like my main goal is just to like be more active in general, like whether that's, you know, doing more actual physical working out or you know have a set routine with what I do like certain workouts, or even just to like get more outside and wander around the yard, like my dad. He literally put on his to-do list ""walk around"" and I'm like ""why do you put that?"" he's like ""because you have to always walk around a little bit."" So he literally like gets up from his like workstation and he'll just walk around the whole yard, like a few times and then he'll come back in and go back to typing and it's like ""check."" Yeah, like when he puts it in there twice. Okay, make sure that he goes multiple times. So I've started recently doing that too, because like you know like it's been... inside sometimes you don't get that natural sunlight.

I know that there's a lot of things in my life where I know, logically what will make me feel better and healthier, but I'm not doing it and so just kind of trying to bridge that gap from, you know, eating more fruits and vegetables to like going for a walk in the morning to drink less coffee to, you know, not working in my bed and working at my desk instead like all of those things you know I like, I know it, like I'm studying health, you know, but I'm not doing it. So I think that that's kind of the biggest thing is just like some level of accountability, so that I can actually like start taking the steps towards making the changes, rather than just kind of thinking about them.","Yeah, it's interesting that you like, say, like you said so much that falls in line with what we do.

And you should be receiving daily text messages moving forward. And the second part of that intervention is meeting with your health coach, which will be new for for the remaining four weeks. So my role is really to meet with you talk to you about what are your health goals review some of the messages that you received during the week and you can give me your feedback on those. But it's really a time for us to talk about your goals. I will be asking you about stress level every week and what you write your stress level. And, but I really want to be able to support you in your progress as you're thinking about goal setting and being able to improve your health and wellness. If at any point questions come up about topics that might be outside of my scope of expertise as a health coach. I will do my best to let you know and also connect to the appropriate resource.

Do you have any questions before we get started. So as we think about. I'm thinking you received quite a few messages all at once, so they may be very fresh in your mind at this point.

So I got my phone and I went, you know, back in history. And I was like, Hey, how are you, what's going on, I want to know you know how you are and all that. And so that message of like reaching out and you know, to people and I think the text itself said, Go out and dance, you know, connect with a friend. So I had a really positive impact.","Oh, yeah. Yes, and I'm realizing now that if it says go dance with a friend, that might not be a doable thing right now.",general,general,8,yes one about connecting friends very much resonated,Edited EXAMEN092_HCS3 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt
"Over FaceTime, it's not, it's not, but the idea of like, Okay, well, this is our current situation but it was for me was like okay reach out, you know, you cannot go dance like I highlighted that in my head, like, but I reached out to my neighbor, I reached out to a friend of my brother who's also one of my friends that I hadn't talked to in a very long time. And, you know, one thing is leading to the other and I'm connecting dots and it's good, it's healthy, you know. I feel like I have been isolating myself.","Yeah, yeah. Isolation is a huge public health issue right now. And we often think of it as, Oh, it affects a certain population. The population we often talk about is older adults. But right now it's affecting all of us because we're all in isolation due to COVID. So finding ways to stay in touch, whether it's virtual, whether it's texts, you know, calls, it does change how we feel and the way that we see our situation.",coach_assessing_state_of_change,general,7,over facetime not not idea okay our current,Edited EXAMEN092_HCS3 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

And, oh my goodness it's so easy to get into that train of like, leave me alone, whatever. And I'm like I'm super uber positive but this year has been challenging. You know, like everyone else. But so, you know, making the effort and reaching out and checking in, has, you know, it may lead to my next, you know, project so it's been really good.",I'm glad that you reconnected.,general,general,8,absolutely hundred percent agree thing easy thing say,Edited EXAMEN092_HCS3 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

But I like to clean text messages and I honestly, so many times, I'm kicking myself. Because I also like to have that clean interface. And I think that's why I really like WhatsApp, because instead of having the choice between keep it or delete it, on WhatsApp you can archive it. And so you no longer see it, but it's there in your history. And so I really like that. It appeases both of my needs, you know, the need of like having a clean screen and the other one of like okay, I'm not going to forget the conversation that we had, you know, last year.

You're still getting messages and you should continue to get text messages for the four weeks of the program. I'm trying to remember if your messages end next week.

"Okay, I'm not going to take up like your whole Friday afternoon or evening, I just want to make sure in case I need to like talk quickly or if maybe I should rush through a couple of points. But, um, I'll take it as slow as you want it to go if that makes sense. You only the session.","Okay, okay, sounds good. Okay, kind of like an asterisk there because you're a week behind but we can talk about that later. Before we get into like the health coaching part of it I just have a brief introduction, just so that you're well informed about what to expect in our sessions. So the research project is a two part intervention. One is the text messages which you should be receiving already. And then the second part is the health coaching. So as your health coach, we will meet about once a week for about 30 minutes to talk about your health goals, and how you go about achieving them. I'll also check in with you about the text messages and your stress level. And then after each health coaching session, I do check in with you through text message here and there just to see if you're needing any support. If questions or topics come up that are outside of my scope as a health coach, I'll let you know about the limitations in my knowledge or experience and refer you to the appropriate resource. So one example of this could be like, if you want to focus on your mental health. I'm not a therapist but you know you can get connected with CAPS and I can provide that referral to you. And then just a few more points, sorry, a little lengthy. While this is a research study and we will be collecting data, our specific conversations will be kept confidential and the data will be de-identified. So you're welcome to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. And then by the end of the project, sorry my voice is going. By the end of the project we really hope that you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting to help you feel more empowered to manage your health overall. And also just a big thank you for choosing to participate in our program. Your participation will help us determine whether more USF students would benefit from this program as well as if we can offer it in a large scale setting. So that's kind of the why and the, thank you for the thank you comes from so we can see how far we can take this project. Um.

So yeah.","So, um, I'll circle back to the text message comment, but real quick. Leading a healthy lifestyle can encompass so many things, and it's so hard to like be the most healthy person, like, like Monday, 7am, like, here we go. Behavior change doesn't happen that quickly. And so for this program, we're going to focus on like small achievable goals that you can manage in a week. And so you can have the same health goal every week. Or you can change it up every week.

"Hi. Sorry I shouldn't have started cleaning, because I can't hear you. I hear you now. Okay, I said sorry I had to go move my car because of street cleaning really quick.=","Oh no, no worries, maybe something came up. I figured something had come up, like, oh wait, see what about that. No thank you, thank you so much for being able to make it and we have time, and my schedule is flexible this morning. So we can still do the allotted time so no worries. So I'll start just by giving you a little introduction about the program itself, and sort of what we're going to be working on today. How does that sound? Good. Well my name is Eddie Gallagher, and I'm going to be your health coach for the next four weeks. As you've noticed, this is a two-part intervention. One aspect is the health and wellness daily text messages that you have been receiving. The other part is to meet with a health coach—that will be me. My role is to check in with you for at least 20 minutes. If we need more time, that’s totally fine. During that time, the goal is to check in with each other. I'll be asking you about the messages to get your input on what is making a difference—whether some are motivating you to do things, or they’re just nice but not really changing anything. The other part is goal setting. We want to work with you to get your thoughts on what goals you want to work on, and together we’ll make them achievable within a week. I’ll also follow up with you between sessions, usually by text or email. If any questions come up that are outside my scope, I’ll connect you to the right resources. While this is considered research, your conversations will remain confidential, and data will be de-identified. You can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable. By the end of the four weeks, we hope you gain skills around problem solving and goal setting, and that you feel empowered to manage your spiritual, mental, and physical health. Thank you for participating—your input will help shape whether this program can be implemented at a larger scale.

The water one has been so-so. I think like the fruit one I'd give it an eight out of 10. The water one was so-so. I killed my plant twice. Yeah. I'm on the right side so when I first started at USF. The professors gave us like a goody bag. And so I thought it was going to have like USF stuff you know like the USF sweatshirt, but, you know, they gave us like this candle that smells good or whatever, they gave us like a picture of the beach because it helps them like calm down and we should look at something calming every day or something. And then this one teacher gave us like this cup of soil that apparently had marigold seeds. And so you just add water and they grow, so I had that plant on my floor and I just kept knocking it over every other day and I was just like ""whatever, I'll leave it there"" and I was like ""wait."" I feel like almost a year later I wonder if there's still seeds in there. So I left it on my window sill thing. I added water. And I didn't do well on a test. So I went into my room to cry and I was like ""I just destroyed this test,"" but my little plant started growing, and I was like ""oh my god like after a year like it actually grew like, what,"" so I have that.

No yeah no it's a great, it's a great question and I, I eat early enough so that by the time that I go to bed, I don't have any acting rapid insulin in my system, which, that is most likely 90% the reason why I experience hypoglycemia when I'm sleeping. Um. Another reason could be I didn't have enough of a big meal at dinner because I wasn't hungry. And my long acting insulin kicks in and continues to work because it works 24 hours, and that's the second reason why I may have a hypoglycemia. Like I cannot go too long without enough sugars in my system. So it's the balance between the two. And, you know, I've had this for five years and oh my goodness, I've played trial and error. And I still, you know once in a while have the hypo at night, and that feels very much outside of my control. Because you know like it's like first, the first strategy is have the dinner at the same time every night which I do. Another strategy is have the same meal, you know, the same combination, so I play with the same meal. It's like protein, carbs, you know, vegetables, it looks like there's, are very boring, they look all the same. I mean, you know, in terms of macros. They're exciting because I cook so, um, and then the last thing is you know check your sugars before going to bed. Two hours before going to bed and before, right before, you know, turning the lights off. And if I'm at the right level there's nothing I need to do. I sometimes have the intuition to have an extra piece of sugar before going to bed. If I know that my meal was too small. But sometimes, everything is, you know, sort of normal, and I still do that.

So in thinking about, you know, future goals that you set for yourself, or even just thinking about improving your health overall. Whenever you find yourself in that situation or kind of wanting to refresh things up. Use this again, the idea of goal setting is really helpful.

It's for like the soda. Like for me right now it's like super hard to just like avoid soda, I'm not drinking soda like 24/7, because I'm not like I have cans and soda but it's just like I had them here at the house so if I'm like, for dinner or something I'll just serve myself like a cup instead of like drinking water or drinking something else like more healthy.

So there's definitely some points you made earlier about things you want to focus on. And you had mentioned that the soda intake before. And my hope was that with increasing the water intake that would actually help you so that you drink less soda right because now you're hydrated and you don't need to reach out for that sort of as much. I mean it's something that you enjoy and I always say everything in moderation. So if you can just find a way to time. I think that should be fine. It's more of not wanting to do it every day that I hear you saying, but within that you also brought up this idea of taking care of yourself a little bit more. And that can be done in multiple ways right that can be done in making sure you're drinking more water, or decreasing the amount of soda.

I just put like music and I cook and I really enjoy cooking. So that has something else that like has been kind of like helping.

"We can start with the goals just because I started thinking about those already. The steps one went well. I think it helps to have a busy weekend so like on Friday, I got like 15,000 steps without even trying. Like, because I was in the airport in the morning and then my sister and I went out to dinner, we decided to like walk instead of driving to the restaurant and then we walked around after dinner and so, like the whole weekend was like that and so like Friday Saturday Sunday I kind of hit the goals like all three days. So that one was good. Water I'm like I think I drink enough water but I don't think I tracked it all week. So kind of a miss there. And then the meal planning one... Overall I know we talked about this last week but I was like I wanted to give myself the flexibility like knowing that things would change and come up to just like fit those meals in kind of wherever and not like stick to a specific day so that one went well. Overall, but like the day to day was a mess. Just because like last weekend I had one day I was planning on being out and one day I was planning on being in, and like because of the rain the days got switched and so like, stuff like that kind of kept happening, where it was like well I need to finish, like the chicken before I leave, but it doesn't need to be Monday, you know, and it ended up being like Tuesday for lunch or whatever so overall like the intention of that one went well. And I knew that I think going into it so the execution like was what I was expecting it to be, but it wasn't like as successful as it could have been if I had tried to stick to it a little bit more. So I think of that one we had done like 10 out of the 14 meals or something. Yeah, that's the other thing too is I didn't like check them off. Let's see. Let's go find it. I think it's still on my fridge.","So it sounds like tracking... Yeah, really tracking is the issue, it's not like the doing the action it's just the like keeping track of the action.

So Colorado is at much higher altitude and so I noticed that even though I grew up there like my nose was really dry, my throat was really dry, like, so I had to drink more water. So I didn't track it but I know that I drank more than I usually do because I needed to like because my body was like... The steps one is interesting because I know I met it, but for some reason I'm like telling myself, almost that it doesn't count because I wouldn't have met it in a normal week, like I didn't plan to meet it. I just kind of happened to. And so I'm like oh I wasn't successful but I was, you know, and so I think that there's like a little bit of a disconnect there that it's like, it doesn't feel like sustainable because I don't have days and weeks like that. So, it feels weird that when you asked me for my overall score I was almost like oh like a seven but I met two out of the three and I almost met the third and so I was like No, it's more than a seven it's just like there's some level of disconnect I think between like the planning and execution because that one got executed but I didn't plan it, you know. So yeah, overall I think it went well and it was almost easier and more enjoyable that it wasn't like a chore, you know, it wasn't like ""God like I've worked for 15 hours"" - 15 hours that was an exaggeration, for 10 hours today and then I need to go take a walk so that I can hit these steps you know it was more like I'm hanging out with my sister and we're having fun and the restaurant's only half a mile away like we'll just walk. And I didn't even notice like, until I checked my phone when I got home, you know, so that was both a good thing and a bad thing because I'm like I wish I had like more weekends like that or more excuses to just be like, I'm going to do something that's fun but also good for me.

I'm like, it's still yesterday to me. Or like I went hiking with my friend in San Francisco like... Those are things that I do. But I think looking at it as like, because I think that the goal that we set was 4500 a day and not like 20,000 a week, it felt different like because even though the averages were high, I was like, there were three or four days in there when I got like under two or 3000 steps, you know, and so that like it's just a little bit discouraging or it makes me feel like, oh that's, that's like my normal lifestyle and this is like an exception, you know.","Yeah, I think, again, what we consider normal these days is not normal, due to the pandemic and so I'm not sure what the future holds for us but you know say you did have to go into the office, like you would have to get steps from your car to the door.

And think about your goals a little bit more long term, like for example in three to six months, what do you want to be able to accomplish.

But if you remember that it will affect the way you feel, the way your body responds to things, and our mood is definitely affected a lot.

I do want to like increase the frequency and how often I do both, but I'm just yeah I really just focusing on those. And I think for me it's about building up my energy in the long term. I feel like I have very low energy throughout the day. So, and I have a new clinical training site with children on the spectrum. So that's going to require a lot of energy and I want to be able to give my all in that training site.

Like a nine.,"I always say anything above seven tells me that okay you've thought about it and yes this is something that you will consistently work on.

That hasn't, that's been an issue for me, either forgetting or just not being motivated to go find something to eat. So I've definitely been proud of myself for eating more consistently. I've had way less stomach problems. And I think that's a good thing. And then, I think exercising too. I think my shoulders, I can already see a difference because that's kind of an area I've been focusing on because I have really bad shoulders. So I already see like a difference when I see my reflection, like if I have a T shirt on they're a lot more square and look not as like narrow. So I'm just noticing the changes has definitely been a good thing.","And what are some of the, you mentioned this a little bit earlier with the energy level, but what are some of the challenges that you're still facing that maybe we could do some problem solving, so that when they come up, you're able to know okay this is what I can do to overcome this.",barrier_identification,nutrition,7,major success eating breakfast eating every meal day,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS4 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

And I need to really break that mentality and tell myself like this is a requirement, this is a required assignment, you can't skip it. Because I do, like there'll be times where I'm just like yeah I really just don't feel like it, so I'm not going to. And then my partner will be like, no, get out there and go do at least 10 minutes and I'm like, all right, and then that will extend to the full time so I'm like okay I'm already out here. So it's really just that initial step of just doing it.","I would say that tends to be quite a challenge at times right, taking that first step. You've been able to find ways to do it. And it also sounds like you have support from others that can push you to do it. So it's very helpful to have support. And I think that is something that's something that can push us forward at times when we doubt ourselves or it might not even be doubt, when we prefer to just say okay, I'm not going to do this right now, but if someone gives us that motivation or that little extra push, then we might be more likely to do it.",barrier_identification,general,7,myself probably biggest obstacle very willing say don,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS4 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

And I'm like, so I know like I have to, if I tell him only once he's going to be like, Wow, really, and I'm like, No. So it's just I think having somebody else hold me accountable is helpful, because I do make the excuse of like, well, I'm young, I'm healthy enough, you know I'm able to walk as far as I need to walk, I'm able to get up and go wherever I need to go, so I do make the excuse that I am capable of doing anything. I don't necessarily feel like I need to exercise but I am reminded you know, in the long term, I'm not going to always be able to do this and it's really about the future, not necessarily about right now.","Yes, I would say, I mean especially when we're thinking about in the realm of public health we think a lot about prevention and preventing future potential chronic conditions, or just the ability to be able to do more as we get older is really important and critical. And just as you mentioned when we are at a certain age we think well we can do it all right now. And just like you mentioned, it may not always be the case right? Because eventually, if we are very lucky, we will get to an older age, and things are going to change, our body will change. So the more that we can stay active and have those habits that are going to help us to have a long and healthy life, the better.

If I can't necessarily just reach. Anyway, and it's kind of like okay well that's like the first thing to go right now is my shoulder and everything else will start to follow. So if I let that go then everything else is going to go. So the goal now is to really make sure that the shoulder isn't a problem, and that nothing else becomes a problem, like you said.","Yes, and, and maybe, and I'm hoping that the exercises that you're doing are helping you to regain more like range of motion for that shoulder. Shoulders are my weakness too. I'm going to tell you a funny story as a side note, and I have like rotator cuff issues. And, yeah, and I get what is called a frozen shoulder, every so often, which to me is I have to walk around like this because it's so painful. And I can't move it, or I call it the T-rex shoulder.

So I think for me, it really is getting me to want to try new things like whether or not I like strawberries, I want to go try some, like strawberry situation, and whether or not I like spinach I want to try to incorporate that some way somehow because how can so many people in this world eat this food and I refuse to like it.

"I did okay. Okay, um, I don't think I quite met the five day goal but I did, I did do it. You know I've been, I've been doing it. I have been making it a practice to set aside time to meditate, and then taking time between classes to just relax. And it was strange too because I might have done the five days honestly. I didn't really track it, but it was strange because it's just like allowing myself to take like even just the 15 minutes was just like more stressful than I thought it was going to be. Because, you know just, and I never really considered myself a busy body but I guess I am because I just was like, you know, I should be doing this. Like there's so much stuff that I need to get done. Like what am I doing just sitting here? Like I have, you know, I was so mad at my mom growing up because she was that way too. Like she wouldn't be able to focus unless the house was like a certain way and then now I'm turning into that too.","And myself. And so turning off our mind sometimes is actually more difficult than we then we realized. I mean, especially because you do have quite a few things you want to get done.

"Honestly, I don't know. I didn't, I wasn't expecting since it was our last session. I wasn't thinking about what goals I wanted to set after this. I was more thinking about just like keeping the consistency and trying to continue some like the habits that I've developed. Like I really like the variety in my diet, like adding more things in, you know, coming up with different ways to put more fruits and vegetables into my diet. And then the harder ones is, you know, cutting down on the takeout. But I've already like started to try and work on that. So like Tuesdays and I'm not going to have the problem anymore because I'm not in class, but like Tuesdays and Thursdays when I would have later classes, I would on Tuesdays I would make lasagna earlier in the day and then it can just be put in the oven. And I even added, and this is it's actually pretty good if you want to try it, I mixed in spinach with the meat. So added vegetables to the meal and I didn't have to worry about making a side or anything too. So it's just put a lot of spinach in with the meat and then everything else was like normal. And that worked out really well. And then just finding different like slow cooker meals for days when I know I'm going to be busy was nice. Like I did Campbell's Soup because I was like these sauce, like I know packages if you want to call it that. They're like they're easy slow cooker meals and the sauce comes in like this little pouch and you just add the meat. So you just put the meat in your slow cooker and the meat and vegetables if it calls for vegetables, and then you just put this sauce in and that's it. Or they have one pan meals which I did a couple times. Like they have like Thai chicken curry, which I'm not that confident in my own cooking skills, so to be able to just have that packet and put in and then just add the rice. And then I was like well how do I add vegetables? This was not just meat and rice. So you know, I put peas in with the with the rice and stuff so that it was a little bit more variety. And yeah, I really like that. I like coming up with ways to add variety to my diet so that things are a little bit more balanced. And I'm noticing improvement in I don't know if this is coincidental but I'm going to say it's related, that my skin has really improved. And so I yeah, I've noticed like my face has been a lot smoother and so in texture and I was like whoa, that's kind of like I don't know if that's from like my skin regimen but I haven't really changed it, but my diet has changed and so I think that that's affecting my skin, which is cool. I like that.","Those are definitely like the good side effects that are unexpected, right.

"And I just say that and I don't know, I don't know how much I trust this doctor, which I know sounds weird, but like I had a ganglion cyst in my wrist, a bad one. And it had been there for like nine months and I went to a doctor and he straight up told me I can't drain it yet because it's not big enough or hard enough, but it'll either go away on its own or it'll get bigger and you can come back in and get it drained. Well, it didn't do either of those things. None of those things. It didn't get bigger, didn't get harder, it still hurt so it wasn't going away. So I went to this other doctor that I didn't really want to go see, but I didn't want to go through the process of getting a new primary care doctor and then getting a referral from that primary care doctor. I had already been seeing this doctor in San Francisco, and this was the guy that he referred me to for hand stuff and I already had seen him before because I have cubital tunnel syndrome. Really. No one seems to know what it is. Anyway, the doctor says carpal tunnel, the physical therapist says cubital tunnel. The guy at the this doctor ticks me off because he just wants me to stretch more. Like that's gonna fix it. And I'm like yes, okay, yes, stretching is going to make this go away that I've had for years and years. But anyway, same kind of thing happened when I went in again with this cyst. He's like oh well this is your body trying to say that you know, you've been stretching a little bit more, but it's not enough and so this is like your body's check engine light turning on. And I was like I don't know about that. And then he really, really made me angry because the audacity. Like I know I'm not a super skinny person, um, but he told me that you know one thing I should work on is adding mileage to my day. Like start if I'm going for walks, go on longer walks. If I'm working out, workout for longer. And I'm like dude, I work out for an hour a day, five to six days a week. Like I work out a lot. Like just because I don't exist in a skinny body doesn't mean that I'm not active and I really hated that. And then he said that basically I needed to be stretching and stretching at length is what I need. So I'll give it a shot. Like he makes me mad but I mean it's not gonna hurt me to be stretching more.","Yes, and I mean it sounds like the experience that you had is it's just a person that has a very set idea of what people should look like and not necessarily about like, it doesn't even have to be.

You know, it's all, it is if you work out too much you just need length and stretching and then it'll go down, you'll get stronger and then you can go even longer. And I'm like dude, athletes get injuries because they overdo it.","I can't believe this person did that. But instruction is not a bad thing just because it's coming from an annoying person.

"Okay, um, particularly adductor stretches, um, because I did have the so the first doctor that I went to, he said he couldn't drain my cyst yet. I did see him for knee pain. And because I was having knee pain when I was sedentary for too long, aching pain, and it was horrible because sitting in lecture halls for an hour to two hours, it was agonizing. I was like okay something's wrong. Like I've been putting up with this for too long. I'm going to go to the doctor, figure out what's going on. And he kind of narrowed it down to like it's mild fascial kind of imbalance. Like my adductors were way, way, way too tight and so it was pulling my kneecap out of the alignment that it needed to be in. And so I went to physical therapy to work on my adductor strength, and that was kind of how also kind of jump started a lot of my fitness was working on my adductor stuff, and then also strengthening my hips because he said that would really help as well.

Also hip stretches.","Yeah, the hips are important, especially and I know you're very young, but as women and as we get older, I think hips are like super important to maintain just for walking purposes. I don't know if you've ever seen this, but have you ever seen like older folks that when they walk they don't like step anymore, they kind of shuffle? And that has to do with like our flexibility in our joints and our hips. So just thinking about that really early on, it's really important.

I would say definitely think about the skills or the tools that have helped you moving forward. That way you can continue to use that as you go on.

But, and I actually started to do that right before COVID hit. I started going to the gym for two weeks straight and I was like, Yes! And COVID happened and all the gyms shut down and I was like, Well, so I went back to kind of my pattern of just not working out, not eating healthy, just kind of doing whatever I need to do to get through my psychology program without really caring about my health.","Yeah. And I mean I think right now, it's a bit of a stressful time and stress tends to sort of prevent us from doing a lot of the things that we want to do. So I think it's normal to sort of draw in at times where life is stressful, but we're definitely going to talk about what are some things that we can still continue to do that will keep us motivated and that will push us forward. Maybe we have to do exercise in a different way, if it's not being able to go to the gym. Although I think some of them are open these days, but even then, let's say I don't feel comfortable going, right? So what can I do that's outside of the gym that's still going to keep me active, whether it's physical activity that you want to focus on, or whether it's maybe nutrition or stress management and how do we do those different things.",establishing_agenda,nutrition,7,been clinical psych student might throw lot psychology,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS1 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

So for me it's just anticipation about working with my clients that gets me really stressed in the beginning of the week, but once I finish all my sessions I'm like alright I'm done, I'm okay, the weekend is coming, and then Monday I'll do it all over again.","Now, do you have a specific workload of clients or does that kind of vary depending on what things are going on at work?",general,stress_management,8,because clinical work doing until today eight because,Edited EXAMEN094_HCS1 - Erika Zuniga Sandoval.txt

"Yeah, I think the messages about eating fruits and vegetables, it was kind of like a personal poke at me because that's something I can consistently not do. And I hear it from a lot of people in my life so it felt like that message was kind of like a reminder like this is a big deal. And, you know, not only do the people in your life know it, but people who don't even know you know that you need this. So that's kind of what stood out to me. And then the exercise piece, I mean, I think I get outside at least 30 minutes a day because I do have a dog that I walk, but I don't feel like it's enough because I was an athlete up until college, and once college happened, it was like sports were non existent, exercising was non existent. I just became so immersed in school that all the physical stuff went away. So I feel like when I go out for 30 minutes my body's like girl you need more, like you can handle way more than this, you just don't do it. So I think for me, I just want to get better at being more consistent about the exercise piece, to be more consistent with exercise.","So the way that we do goal setting is, for example, today is our first session, and we start talking about what are some of the things that you want to focus on.

And then by the time I get home, and I don't know, I don't do very well at night so I wouldn't do any of these workouts after like 6pm or maybe after 7pm.

And at the same time we are kind of helping each other as we go through this period of time that's very uncertain. It's changed a lot of the ways that we do things.
